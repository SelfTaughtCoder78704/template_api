Did she seem distracted and uninterested when you were talking about the current investment strategies?</p><p> What you are experiencing is a disconnect between her comfort zone and yours. As an advisor you are used to talking about financial plans and investments in terms of growth potential and rates of return. Those things are your passion. But for her, money means security and the ability to make life choices.</p><p> If you want to truly engage her and keep her as a loyal client, one who happily recommends you to her friends &ndash; you need to connect with her on her terms.</p><h3> Here are 5 things to listen for when meeting with female clients. <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  Personal interests </strong></h3><p> What does she like to do? What are her hobbies, passions, pastimes? Does she garden, read books, travel or play tennis? When she talks, be attentive to common interests &ndash; just be careful not to take over the conversation with your own stories.</p><h3> <strong>  Her take on current events </strong></h3><p> Listen for her comments about current events. How does she feel about pipelines and the environment, what about health trends and pharmaceuticals? Use what she says to boost her confidence by telling her that opinions and actions from people like her, can and do, impact a company&rsquo;s stock.</p><h3> <strong>  What her life goals are </strong></h3><p> Ask her what her goals and dreams are - what&rsquo;s on her &ldquo;bucket list&rdquo;?  By listening to what she wants to do in life you will gain valuable insight to her attitudes about finances. What does she want/need money for?</p><h3> <strong>  Her comfort level with your service </strong></h3><p> Listen carefully for clues: is she telling you she is too busy, or she doesn&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying. Be prepared to adjust how often you meet, where you meet and even how you present your strategies.</p><h3> <strong>  Her expectations of you </strong></h3><p> Does she say things like: &ldquo;I thought you were going to&hellip;&rdquo;  Ask her how she sees her role around when it comes to her investments. Does she leave it all up to you? That may sound like an ideal client but it leaves her disengaged and could put you at risk. If she actually plays a role, she&rsquo;ll be more engaged and less likely to leave.</p><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> Only by truly listening to and engaging with female clients can you become the kind of trusted advisor she is happy to recommend to friends and family.</p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

{"original_id":5033,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Value Retention and Cost Control Aren't Optional for Businesses","link":"why-value-retention-and-cost-control-arent-optional-for-businesses","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Business leaders are constantly challenged by revenue and profitability objectives, customer growth goals, market shifts and competition. Leaders know success depends on identifying and maximizing new opportunities, deploying the best talent and tools, and ensuring the organization is well aligned to consistently deliver top-notch products and services.</p><p> Value retention and cost control aren&rsquo;t optional.</p><p> Creating innovative and differentiated new products and services &ndash; that meet financial targets &ndash; is no small task.</p><p> Leaders approve the strongest, most innovative, product/service concepts. This triggers product/service development, typically including production timeframes, cost, revenue and margin forecasts, launch plans and timing. All elements leading to launch receive intense focus and review.</p><p> Sound familiar?</p><p> However, for organizations reaping the maximum value of new products/services, &ldquo;launch&rdquo; is one of multiple essential actions. Strategic customer and partner relationships can drive considerable additional value. Focusing solely on &ldquo;launch&rdquo; results in lower actual outcomes than were possible. &ldquo;Value leakage&rdquo; describes this unfortunately common reality.</p><p> Two significant examples:</p><p> 1. Innovation-fed launch of new products/services</p><p> Plans to optimize execution are minimal. An articulated strategy for helping customers learn enough about the products and services to purchase commitments is often lacking. Frequently, product/service introduction serves as initiative conclusion. Plans to optimize execution and beyond are minimal.</p><p> 2. Poor supplier/supply chain management</p><p> A recent Deloitte study 1  evaluates value leakage within outsourcing. Their study showed 72% of respondents believe they do not have the right tools and processes to manage vendors. And 49% indicated they aren&rsquo;t effectively staffed with the skills needed for the task.</p><p> When companies outsource several issues often lead to not achieving the full expected value of the supplier relationships. Issues begin at the time a supplier agreement is created. Overarching issues are failure to manage suppliers beyond controlling selected factors and specified contracts.</p><p> Costly issues include:</p><p> a. Ineffective communications <br/> b. Unexpected cost increases <br/> c. Invoicing and clerical errors <br/> d. Slower speed to market <br/> e. Insufficient capacity (including ability to scale up and down) <br/> f. Specialized resource availability <br/> g. Incomplete compliance documentation <br/> h. Unclear management roles and authority <br/> i. Unmanaged supplier performance</p><p> A recent Chief Executive 2  article addresses this issue.</p><h3> Value Leakage &ndash; Innovation</h3><p> A new product/service sales plan isn&rsquo;t enough. A comprehensive process is crucial. It must include initial ideas through development; marketing strategies; value proposition (including methods for customers to measure total product/service value); sales strategies and sales training; plans and execution &ndash; integrating customer service, tech-support, custom versions, add-ons, and whatever else your customers value and are willing to pay for.</p><p> Defined organizational capabilities, with explicit differentiating factors your customers&rsquo; value is critical to realizing the full value of your organization&rsquo;s capabilities.</p><h3> Value Leakage &ndash; Supply Chain</h3><p> Sirion Labs recent article 3  quoted an International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) survey where 63% of respondents reported supplier contract value loss of 25% due to poor governance.</p><p> Value leakage was primarily attributed to: <br/> 1. The &ldquo;pre-signature&rdquo; element of the outsourcing arrangement receives the majority of attention &ndash; with little focus on long-term management. <br/> 2. Outsourcing contracts are frequently negotiated without operations input and feedback. Yet once signed, operations staff are generally responsible for contract management. <br/> 3. While contracts can be highly detailed, lengthy and complex, &ldquo;post-signature&rdquo; contract management frequently lacks advanced technology and automation tools needed. In fact, Excel is currently the most common tool. (The &ldquo;pre-signature&rdquo; phase routinely incorporates advanced technology, automation and other tools.)</p><p> Looking Forward</p><p> Considerable financial rewards are attainable by organizations focused on the entire value the company offers. Using available advanced technology, automation and other tools in customer relationships and supplier contract and relationship management will streamline the process. ROI and swift investment payback together make a very compelling case.</p><p> Action Items: <br/> 1. Evaluate your company&rsquo;s innovation and product/service development process to determine whether it incorporates value capture and retention elements in all potential areas. Strengthen any weak areas. Reassess annually at minimum to add new potential value opportunities that may arise. <br/> 2. Ensure you have the right talent in key areas to oversee potential value capture and retention. Hire and/or develop as needed. <br/> 3. Assess your supply chain/supplier management processes thoroughly to ensure they encompass all pre- and post- signature components of supply management, are staffed appropriately, and are able to utilize the most advanced technology and tools available. <br/> 4. Confirm employees in all areas of the company understand the issue of value leakage and how they can help add to and/or retain value. Consider establishing an incentive program for employees who identify new ways to capture and/or retain value.</p><p> Sources: <br/> 1.  <u>  Smarter Sourcing Governance &ndash; Improve the Value of Your Service Provider Relationships </u> , Deloitte, 2015 <br/> 2.

{"original_id":5034,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How a New Slower, Better World Might Arise","link":"how-a-new-slower-better-world-might-arise","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s As You Like It , the language seemed to accelerate to shrill inhuman interchanges accompanied with much brilliant physicality but without a chance for the words to sink in deeply.</p><p> It seemed like a high speed cartoon, a caricature of the play and I wondered why most of the actors were in such a hurry and why the comedy was dependent on cheap modern antics like high fives unknown in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time.</p><p> Is technology simply adapting us to higher frequencies, to a new shrill emptiness with too much information too fast to digest? Have we become captive audiences with engineered responses replacing the canned laughter of 1950&rsquo;s TV? Is this a cultural phenomenon that we have accepted along with the canned trading by supercomputers that dominates our financial markets?</p><p> When I founded an impact investment firm in 2012 and later wrote my book: Making Money Matter, it was with the hope that automation and the speeding up of life in our world would not increase out of control, but instead investors would increasingly slow down to think about the impact of their investments.</p><p> The question for impact investors is, while thinking, how do we compete in public markets that are now mostly traded by unthinking machines ready to gobble up any opportunity for creating value before an honest and thoughtful trader can say boo.</p><p> Dan Martell, who now runs our public equity fund, gave up trading in 2012 at the end of the Mayan Calendar, not suspecting the end of the world. He was simply aware that after decades of successful intuitive decision making as a floor trader and 10 years as a portfolio manager with international banks and hedge funds, he simply could no longer beat the machines.</p><p> Recently he came back to work with our impact funds because he sees that having deep knowledge about environmental and social issues may be a way to outperform mindless algorithms. It is our advantage.</p><p> We recently responded to a request from the SEC for professional input on how High Frequency Trading (HFT) should be handled. Mr. Martell has seen how these speedy machines controlled by the largest investors have become detrimental to others. This is unfair and should be outlawed in our opinion. Why? Because it flies in the face of a rule that prevents the &ldquo;front running&rdquo; of existing orders. Front running is the unethical practice of trading a security with advanced knowledge of pending orders. By being able to make a market inside the conventional bids and offers of smaller human investors such as us, the machines always win all else being equal.</p><p> HFT program trading algorithms allow big guys to swoop in with a minuscule difference in their offer and winning the auction a millisecond ahead of the crowd. Under the guise of market-making the HFT trading machines justify the efficiency of their pricing without considering the cost to the little guys. They merely insert themselves, with little economic risk, to extort a small profit inside the legitimate bid and offer range of unarmed investors.</p><p> It may be a stretch to compare high speed computerized trading to Shakespearean actors speaking too fast and too shrill for an old timer to catch the meaning. But I sense this speeding up of everything is going to end in a cultural crash if we don&rsquo;t slow down, and we may be catapulted back to the original meaning of impact, BAM! I sense the commonality of extremes longing for a time when the rich won&rsquo;t keep getting richer behind our backs while we mostly lose our local, small scale advantage, our time with loved ones, our reflections at the end of the day.</p><p> What is absolutely clear is that all things being equal is not the true reality of our world. You might assume: the big money with the big computers or the big oil fields are bound to win and with their winning we could lose our world. We can fear Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s threat to sell $750B in treasuries if their country is named in the 9/11 bill now in Congress. That is some powerful leverage. Other sovereign nations with oil- wealth could certainly wreak havoc if that was their goal. There are many doomsday scenarios.</p><p> But what if it is the thoughtful people who have the advantage today: the innovators, the meditants, the slow talkers, the visionaries? Prince Salman may be the first big money person who gets it: recently announcing that Saudi Arabia plans to diversify away from fossil fuels; to take their oil public and keep only 5% of it. What if, instead of buying the 5 or 6 largest companies in the world with his expected $2T windfall they put $33MM into all 60,000 public companies on Bloomberg trading terminals and turned them green? Something crazy good could happen: a kind of surreal awakening to real values could emerge. New companies with the best scalable solutions would gain traction, direction and subsequently would replace the mindless giant banks, plastic warehouse stores and the fossilized economy would crash. BAM! And a new slower, better world might arise. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-04-28 16:44:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-04-28 16:44:38.000000","image_url":"2016/4/article_placeholder_1Noevm5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-a-new-slower-better-world-might-arise/\", \"post_id\": \"10720\", \"post_date\": \"2016-04-28 16:44:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-04-28 16:44:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-a-new-slower-better-world-might-arise\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10719\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5233\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/How-a-New-Slower-Better-World-Might-Arise.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"664\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1461945600,"author_id":181,"chart_url":""}

Productivity is a big factor in who is selected for certain assignments as well as who gets promoted up the chain of command. This matters because most of us are looking for new challenges and indeed for more money and benefits. There are some ways to increase your personal productivity at work in a big way.</p><h3> Prepare The Night Before</h3><p> <br/> A big struggle for many is getting to work in a mood that is conducive to being productive. In a world where there is so much expected of us, getting enough sleep often gets pushed to the back burner. People like to believe that they can push off sleep and that it won&rsquo;t have an impact on them. Those people are mistaken. Getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep is critical to work success.</p><h3> Schedule Yourself Appropriately</h3><p> <br/> Most workers have the misguided notion that they can avoid planning out their days. They think that they can simply tackle tasks as they come along. This is a bad idea to have.Apcevent.com suggests to make &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; with your work. Block out time on your calendar daily to work on specific projects or assignments. Start with the end in mind. Once you know how long a task will take, work backwards from the end of your day to see where to best allocate time for that particular task. Set a time every week to stay on top of your documents&rsquo; organization, to clean out files and emails before your storage gets unmanageable.</p><p> The better categorized your day is, the more that you accomplish throughout the day.</p><h3> Lower The Amount Of Interruptions</h3><p> <br/> The number of interruptions that can face a worker are at an all time high. There are the co-workers popping in to say something, the e-mails flying in at a rapid pace, and the websites that are just begging you to take a look at a quick video or article. Minimizing these distractions is a key way to accomplish the things that you have set out for yourself.</p><p> <a href=\"http://bridgebetween.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Contact us </a>  to learn more about how to accomplish tasks you have set out for yourself through the day and increase your productivity at work.

{"original_id":5037,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Technology Has Accelerated the Pace of Change in How Financial Services Are Consumed","link":"technology-has-accelerated-the-pace-of-change-in-how-financial-services-are-consumed","source_link":null,"content":"Written by <u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/margaret_mpayne\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Margaret Payne </a></u><u> ​</u>The tech invasion of finance has accelerated the pace of change in how financial services are consumed, how investments are constructed and how the financial industry markets itself.  As firms assimilate this accelerating change, there are some ready-made lessons from the world of tech that can be applied to the content the industry uses to connect with its audiences.Financial marketers can look to their tech industry counterparts to make sure their marketing, communications and content keeps up. In order to boost the scale of their marketing efforts, we see opportunities for financial firms to improve their utilization of the below three trends that tech firms are already beginning to master.<h3> Influencers exist in every industry vertical or topic</h3>These established <a href=\"http://www.thenewshackers.com/influencing-influencers-tech-brands-can-tap-new-social-media-celebrities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> thought leaders</a> guide their followers to new ideas and ways of thinking. Influencers can shape opinions or enact change, and come in many different varieties.Celebrities, academics and the media can all be considered influencers as long as they are commonly respected in their given industry and have a built-in following. Take Josh Brown, &ldquo;The Reformed Broker.&rdquo; <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> His blog</a> is widely-read and serves as a platform to share his insights on market news, as well as other material he is reading. Most importantly, people care about what he has to say. He has appeared on and contributed to many top-tier outlets and has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReformedBroker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> a huge following on social media</a> with more than 138,000 Twitter followers.<img alt=\"\" height=\"619\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/social-media-influencers_0.png\" width=\"506\"/>To tap into an influencer&rsquo;s followers, interact with them. Start by ensuring you&rsquo;re on the right social media platforms. Influencers experiment with new ways to connect with their audience, so if you want to exchange ideas with them, you need to be using the same platforms.Producing compelling content will also open the door for you to communicate with influencers. Get their attention with fresh ideas and opinions.<h3> Go beyond the chart with visuals</h3><a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/infographics-visual-content-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> According to Buffer</a>, a social media management company, 90 percent of information sent to the brain is visual, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that visual content receives 94 percent more views. Visuals allow you to communicate in ways our brain already understands.But not just any image will effectively get your message across. Charts and graphs are commonly used in financial services, but they can be overly complex. If it takes viewers more than a few minutes to extrapolate a takeaway, the visual likely isn&rsquo;t resonating with its intended audience.<img alt=\"\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/social-media-visuals_0.png\" width=\"510\"/>Using eye-catching imagery that simply and clearly depicts your message is key. Carl Richards, also known as &ldquo;The Sketch Guy,&rdquo; has adeptly mastered this balancing act. He uses <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/your-money/carl-richards-gallery.html?_r=1&amp;\" target=\"_blank\"> straightforward drawings</a> (sometimes on napkins) to communicate complex personal finance topics in relatable and intuitive ways.<h3> Video sucks in your audience</h3>Video has the ability to capture your audience&rsquo;s attention unlike any other medium. <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/section/video?playerType=events&amp;eventID=td022016&amp;bctid=4739762318001&amp;date=20160204\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Watch</a><a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gregory FCA</a> client Joe Duran, CEO of United Capital, discuss the bionic adviser with Matt Ackerman of InvestmentNews over a game of ping pong.

Apps like Periscope and Facebook Live allow you to interact with users via live broadcasting, so take advantage of the real-time, immediate feedback and ease of use. Live streaming presents an opportunity for the financial services professional, especially those of you who are media trained and have appeared on major TV networks like CNBC and Fox Business, to connect with your audience right from your desk.It&rsquo;s as easy as propping your phone up, hitting the record button, and discussing recent market news. Holding webinars? Imagine being able to skip the slides and deliver something interesting to the people tuning into your broadcast. Take your followers to conferences or the New York Stock Exchange ─ let them go where you go. The reach and accessibility afforded by video and live broadcasting can&rsquo;t be ignored.It takes some work to fully master these trends and reap the benefits. But it&rsquo;s worth it. A more engaged audience means better dissemination of your content. The game continues to change and it&rsquo;s not a choice as to whether you accept it &ndash; evolve or be left behind. Have an open mind and don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment to see what works best for you and your firm.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 15:04:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 15:04:04.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/technology-has-accelerated-the-pace-of-change-in-how-financial-services-are-consumed/\", \"post_id\": \"10729\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 15:04:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 15:04:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"technology-has-accelerated-the-pace-of-change-in-how-financial-services-are-consumed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10725\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5238\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Technology-Has-Accelerated-the-Pace-of-Change-in-How-Financial-Services-Are-Consumed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1332\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462194000,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5038,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Authenticity Leverages and Supports Innovation","link":"how-authenticity-leverages-and-supports-innovation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@anthonyferrier\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthonyferrier?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Anthony Ferrier  </a> </u>  and Jim Frawley</p>Authenticity and innovation are two of today&rsquo;s biggest corporate buzzwords. They are often considered as separate values, but in reality they have much in common and in this article we will examine the areas of overlap and potential leverage benefits.Neither of these terms have the same definition from company to company, or even amongst individuals. For the purpose of this article we will use the following definitions:<li> Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or for which customers will pay. (reference BusinessDictionary.com).</li><li> Authenticity is the quality of being real or true, and is best understood as a social construction that has been put into place to achieve a particular aim. (Cambridge Dictionary online and Library Trends (Vol.56, No. 1)</li>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s examine ways in which authenticity leverages and supports innovation, and vice-versa. Some examples include:<h3> 1. Authenticity and Design Thinking</h3>Without an authentic approach it is difficult to identify those key pain points that drive the development of truly innovative ideas.These days&rsquo; innovation within a corporate setting is synonymous with Design Thinking (DT) approaches. The fact is that DT requires a genuine understanding and appreciation of not only what is possible, but what is most beneficial from a client / end user perspective. Without an authentic approach it is difficult to identify those key pain points that drive the development of truly innovative ideas. And while you are at it, flip the DT approach and use it on yourselves. Work with your management team, using a DT process, to appropriately define what authenticity and innovation look like, specific to your organization. In another view, flip the DT approach to say that your innovation people / workers are your first customer. Meeting their needs and helping them define their authentic selves will drive innovation and additional benefits to the end user.<h3> 2. Roles in innovation</h3>People often think that being innovative is a singular focus on coming up with the lightbulb idea that will change everything. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not that easy. The reality is that innovation requires a range of skills and abilities, and few people possess all aspects (Suzan Briganti at <a href=\"http://www.totembrand.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Totem</a> writes about this). Accordingly, it is important for innovators to recognize their true, specific skills in the context of identifying, selecting and executing new ideas. Often times, when we think of our &ldquo;authentic selves,&rdquo; we see the person we want to be &ndash; not what&rsquo;s actually there. Realistic awareness of your abilities, skills and preferences is key to identifying your true role in innovation. In doing this, don&rsquo;t just focus on a self-perspective of skills &ndash; there is a wealth of information from assessments, team members, managers and direct reports that can provide valuable insight into your best strengths. A self-assessment is rarely easy, but is essential to the success of positioning yourself as an effective innovator.<h3> 3. Cognitive Diversity is what enhances innovation</h3>Innovation is organic &ndash; it&rsquo;s the sprout of an idea that can be generated from need and a desire for improvement and change. Countless studies have shown how team diversity impacts success. Most people think of diversity in the perspective of race, gender, functional perspective, but when it comes to innovation,  <a href=\"http://xponents.com/resources/white-pages-and-articles/cognitive-diversity-styles-and-strengths/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Cognitive Diversity</a> can be most beneficial. In addition to highly cognitive, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s possible&rdquo;-type thinkers, there are others who have a pre-disposition toward pragmatic, realistic, and &ldquo;how do we get things done&rdquo; thinking. How often have you worked with someone who just doesn&rsquo;t think in the way that you do? This is the type of diversity that leads to conflict, both positive and negative. Within positive, productive conflict, innovation germinates and is created. Recognizing differing individual cognitive preference (the way a person processes and thinks), in the context of a greater team, positions ideas within a sound cultural foundation that will lead to new, productive ideas, systems and processes.<h3> 4. Focus of Efforts</h3>Given that authenticity and innovation efforts are often driven by small program teams working across complex, globally-dispersed organizations, the direction of efforts and actions need to be carefully calibrated to generate the biggest impact. For this reason an approach can be to first focus support on those individuals who exhibit a natural inclination towards innovative and authentic behavior, and then communicate their success to others as positive, aspirational role models. The latest neuroscience research shows that certain types of people are pre-disposed to highly cognitive, &ldquo;idea-based&rdquo; thinking. These are the individuals that typically ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s possible?&rdquo; and have the ideas that many others haven&rsquo;t thought of yet.<h3> 5. Transitioning Internal Competencies to External Differentiators</h3>Increasingly, innovation and behavior change experts are shifting their focus from internal efforts, to align with more external customer marketing, investor positioning and recruitment goals. Both innovation and authentic competencies are positively perceived by clients, investors and talent, so by combining efforts with a well positioned communications effort, these internal efforts can generate additional external impacts .<h3> 6. Authenticity in innovation leadership</h3>Authenticity, <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/library_trends/v056/56.1macneil.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> as it&rsquo;s defined</a>, is a social construction that has been put in place to achieve a particular aim and is typically an ongoing effort to demonstrate. This means that simple actions aren&rsquo;t enough &ndash; those actions need to be perceived as consistent and authentic to reach that goal. Those leading corporate Innovation Programs need to authentically exhibit the belief in their actions and direction at all times, as they are to be seen as champions of this thinking in often evasive corporate settings.<h3> 7. Cultural leadership is key</h3>Principles of authenticity and innovation don&rsquo;t work well when done in piecemeal fashion. Leaders of these efforts often fail to recognize that they need to address underlying cultural drivers of an organization to ensure the success of their efforts. For this reason, leadership should consider both competencies together and seek to build a strategic plan to support supporting activities that lead to longer-term cultural change. In addition, corporate and business unit leadership need to support and bridge top/down and bottom/up efforts.These are just some thoughts on the leverage and benefits that can be generated by combining innovation and authentic competencies.

I didn&rsquo;t suspect that the class I was embarking upon would have such broad impact on my life.</p><p> As a professional speaker, I envisioned possible stage benefits from learning improvisational comedy skills but I hadn&rsquo;t appreciated the benefits that improv training would provide me in my role as a leader or as a consultant charged with helping organizations increase the quality of experiences they provided to their customers.</p><p> So in the hope that principles of improv might help you lead positive customer-focused changes, I thought I would outline a few improv tools over a series of blog posts.</p><h3> The first principle is &ldquo;YES AND.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Imagine you walk onto an empty stage and are expected to create a plausbile yet funny scene for an audience. Let&rsquo;s assume you start by asking for a suggestion of a location and someone in the the audience yells out a &ldquo;bowling alley.&rdquo; Further imagine, you embrace that suggestion because it saves you from having to come up with your own starting place. In essence, you say &ldquo;YES&rdquo; to the suggestion AND begin to create the scene by lifting an imaginary bowling ball. Let&rsquo;s further assume that another actor from your improv troupe enters the stage and says, &ldquo;Hey Gus, I got 5 dollars that says you will blow this last frame and miss your perfect game.&rdquo; You respond, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see your 5 dollar bill and raise you 10.&rdquo;   Great &ndash; your scene is taking shape! Think about what would happened if your response to your colleague was, &ldquo;I am not Gus and what are you talking about a perfect game.&rdquo;</p><p> YES AND is a powerful response to so many business situations where you might wish to inspire innovation or side-step false choices. For example, I am often asked if a client&rsquo;s company should  first improve their employee experience  or  their customer experience. My answer is often &ldquo;YES AND lets look at how we can realistically and successfully make some progress on each.&rdquo;</p><p> Senior leaders at companies like The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company or Mercedes-Benz (the subjects of my books  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/New-Gold-Standard-Leadership-Ritz-Carlton/dp/0071548335/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461545085&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=joseph+michelli\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The New Gold Standard </a>  and  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Driven-Delight-Delivering-World-Class-Mercedes-Benz/dp/007180630X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461545085&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=joseph+michelli\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Driven to Delight </a> , respectively) have often cited the phrase &ldquo;the answer is &ldquo;YES&rdquo; now what is the question?&rdquo; As such, those leaders strive to say YES to team members and customers. Let&rsquo;s assume a customer asks for something that can&rsquo;t be provided at the Ritz-Carlton, service professionals (the ladies and gentlemen of the Ritz-Carlton) are discouraged from saying NO, while instead identifying what can be provided. In extraordinary service brands, YES AND becomes the default mindset!</p><h3> So how will you answer this question?

People listen to what we say in the boardroom or the classroom, and then they watch how we behave in the hallways and at the curbside. If our behaviour is inconsistent, others are confused at best&mdash;or worse, they write us off completely. In particular, they are watching us intently at inflection points: times of error and of challenge. Do we obfuscate or do we address the issue plainly and openly? If there is compensation to be made for an error, do we deal with it forthrightly or do we try to negotiate the least we can get away with? The bottom line is that opacity might work for a while, but generally not for long&mdash;so why not be a model of generosity.</p><p> When we are about to respond to a difficult issue, my advice is to go and stand about a half-year down the road from what we are about to say or write, and see if it still feels like the right thing to do or say.

{"original_id":5041,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"An Innovative Approach to Wealth Transfer and Generational Planning","link":"an-innovative-approach-to-wealth-transfer-and-generational-planning","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The transfer of wealth between generations has become a defining issue for the financial services industry. In the coming years, RIAs and fee-based advisors will need to prepare for an inevitable shift that will significantly impact how they manage their practice and counsel their clients. This massive intergenerational transfer of wealth is starting now &ndash; and is on pace to accelerate over the next three decades. Any advisor who is building their practice for the long-term must take action.</p><p> Expertise in wealth transfer and generational planning is critical to retain clients, especially the high net worth. It can help deepen the relationship with your client, as well as your client&rsquo;s family, allowing you to manage more of the household&rsquo;s assets. It can not only help your client leave an enduring legacy for future generations &ndash; it can also help you create a future generation of clients for your firm.</p><p> To capitalize on this powerful trend, it is important to understand three key components:</p><li> The demographics driving wealth transfer;</li><li> The innovative approaches to help clients build and transfer their legacy; and</li><li> How generational differences and family dynamics can impact client retention. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Demographics Drive a Growing Opportunity </strong></h3><p> <br/> According to the Pew Research Center, roughly 10,000 Baby Boomers are turning 65 every day and close to 10,000 more will cross that threshold each day for the next 19 years. As this massive cohort transitions from accumulation to retirement, estate planning increases in importance.</p><p> The opportunity is huge. As noted in a recent study by Accenture , a &ldquo;Great Transfer&rdquo; of wealth &ndash; estimated at over $12 trillion &ndash; is currently taking place as Boomers inherit wealth from their parents. And an even &ldquo;Greater Transfer&rdquo; &ndash; estimated at over $30 trillion &ndash; will occur as Boomers pass on wealth to their heirs.</p><p> This is especially relevant for the growing number of high net worth households. According to the 2013 U.S. Trust, Insights on Wealth and Worth, there are now nearly 2 million households in the U.S. with investable assets of $3 million or more. And while nearly six in ten of wealthy investors believe it is important to leave a financial legacy to the next generation, the desire does not always translate into action. In fact, 72 percent of high net worth investors surveyed do not have a comprehensive estate plan, 66 percent have not implemented a revocable trust and 80 percent do not have an irrevocable trust.</p><h3> <strong>  An Innovative Approach for Wealth Transfer </strong></h3><p> <br/> These facts show an obvious need for advisors to advance the process. Without an estate plan for the effective transfer of wealth, clients&rsquo; heirs may be subjected to a number of obstacles, such as probate, creditors, lawsuits, judgments and legal fees &ndash; all of which can compromise the value of the legacy that you and your client worked hard to create. More importantly, this provides an opportunity for you to demonstrate a proactive commitment to serve your client and their family, using an innovative approach to holistically integrate wealth transfer within your client&rsquo;s overall financial plan.</p><p> To maximize outcomes for clients and their heirs, there is an urgent need for wealth transfer solutions that can adapt to today&rsquo;s challenging investment environment of ongoing volatility, record low-yields and rising tax rates. As a result, trust planning has become an increasingly important solution. While the traditional purpose of using a trust has been to control the distribution of assets from the &ldquo;governance&rdquo; point of view, today many advisors say that tax planning is the primary factor driving their decision to use trusts.</p><p> With the advent of new products, advisors can offer their clients innovative ways of funding a trust. One such method is to use a variable annuity (VA) to control how much they pay in taxes &ndash; and when they pay those taxes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessarily complicated to use annuities with trusts &ndash; and there can be measurable benefits in certain scenarios,&rdquo; says Drew J. Bottaro, Vice President and Senior Financial Counselor at Weston Financial. &ldquo;Tax deferral is one of the primary benefits. And that&rsquo;s where a low-cost Investment-Only Variable Annuity with a broad choice of underlying funds provides the competitive advantage.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Using IOVAs to Tax-Optimize Trusts </strong></h3><p> <br/> While traditional VAs have often been inappropriate for trusts, because of high asset-based insurance fees, a limited selection of investment options, complex guarantees and steep commissions, a new generation of low-cost Investment-Only Variable Annuities (IOVAs) has changed the value proposition.</p><p> With low-costs or flat-fees, IOVAs can help maximize the power of tax-deferral. With an expanded selection of underlying funds, including more non-correlated assets and liquid alternative funds that employ strategies like those favored by hedge funds and elite institutional investors, IOVAs can help enhance diversification and better manage volatility. Combined, this helps to build and maintain more wealth within the trust.</p><p> When using an IOVA to tax-optimize trusts, keep in mind specific guidelines. In particular, the trust must be acting as a representative or an &ldquo;agent of a natural person&rdquo; in order for an IOVA, or any other type of VA, to be used. Further, there are distinct types of trusts that keep the annuity&rsquo;s tax-deferral intact. Each of these distinct types of trusts can offer specific advantages to minimize, delay or eliminate income to the beneficiary, helping to increase accumulation and reduce the beneficiaries&rsquo; tax burden.</p><p> For example, the Net Income with Makeup Charitable Remainder Unitrust (NIMCRUT) will allow for the ability to reduce the taxation of highly appreciated assets and then control timing of the distribution of income. The Revocable Trust can be especially valuable for a grantor in a high tax bracket. The Credit Shelter Trust or Bypass Trust is a vehicle to keep current trust income to a minimum &ndash; and save more wealth for the next generation. The Special Needs Trust or Supplemental Needs Trust can allow the trustee total discretion for distributing assets to the child benefitting from the trust.</p><p> Outside of using trusts, another strategic option is to use a non-qualified stretch with an IOVA to transfer wealth to heirs while avoiding probate and estate taxes. &ldquo;It used to be that if you were going to leave an annuity to your children, all the gains were taxed at death. It could take a big hit,&rdquo; says Wes Martin, ChFC, CFP, founder and principal of Martin Financial Group. &ldquo;Now you can use a VA in the same way that you would use a stretch IRA. Where you continue to tax-defer the money and pay out a set distribution over your children&rsquo;s lifetime.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Generational Dynamics </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once you have developed the appropriate solution for the effective transfer of wealth, keep in mind one important fact: Studies show that as much as 86 percent of heirs do not stay with their parents&rsquo; advisors. A number of generational dynamics are at play. Addressing these factors head on presents a tremendous opportunity for using generational planning &ndash; alongside wealth transfer &ndash; to create a new generation of clients.</p><p> First, younger investors are likely to be more self-directed, well-educated and independent than their parents. Today, there is no longer a monopoly on financial information, with more transparency and more access to real-time market data. Likewise, younger investors are inclined to access information differently than their parents, with increased focus on mobile, social and digital channels. Developing a platform to leverage these channels is becoming increasingly important.</p><p> Next, the financial advisory industry is aging. As studies show, the average age of today&rsquo;s advisors is 50 years &ndash; and many firms don&rsquo;t have a strategy to attract or retain younger clients. This presents a unique opportunity. Advisors can experience tremendous benefit from hiring a younger generation of advisors who can serve this younger generation of clients &ndash; to understand their expectations, communicate with them on their own terms, and grow with them as they grow their AUM.</p><p> And while there is no doubt that serving the head of the household is your primary focus, there are huge benefits from shifting to a more family-centric approach. Engaging the spouse and other family members in the planning process now, can help to retain them in the future. These conversations don&rsquo;t always happen easily. According to Accenture, more than 60 percent of children did not have the opportunity to discuss a will with their parents before they passed. But if the ultimate goal is to build wealth for the entire family, and retain them as your clients, then engaging family members in this dialogue becomes an important part of your job.</p><h3> <strong>  Capitalize on a Powerful Trend </strong></h3><p> <br/> As this tremendous transfer of wealth takes places &ndash; first to Boomers, then to Gen X, then to Millenials &ndash; it is important for advisors to develop effective wealth transfer strategies for their clients and their families. And to confront today&rsquo;s challenging investment environment of ongoing volatility, record low-yields and rising tax rates, trust planning is a solution that is increasing in importance. Using an Investment Only annuity (IOVA) to tax-optimize trusts, means that you can control not only how much clients pay in taxes &ndash; but also when they pay those taxes &ndash; to maximize outcomes for clients and their heirs.</p><p> And based on the enormous amount of wealth that will soon be transferred to this next generation, it&rsquo;s critical that advisors focus on developing sustainable relationships with these young investors. This is the only way to retain these clients and their assets. Combining an innovative approach to wealth transfer and savvy strategies for generational planning, you can position your firm to serve and retain the next generation of clients.</p><p> Learn more about Jefferson National <a href=\"https://www.jeffnat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>1.

One thing I know for sure is that a financially empowered woman is unstoppable in her ability to take excellent care of herself.</p><p> For women, being empowered around money has a positive impact on areas of her life such as:</p><li> Increases overall self-confidence</li><li> Reduces stress and anxiety about money</li><li> Creates a more secure financial future</li><li> If she&rsquo;s a business owner, she attracts more clients and boosts sales &amp; income <br/>  </li><p> This is exactly what happened for my client, Nicole.</p><p> Before I started working with Nicole, she was concerned about her overall financial security. She had financial goals, but wasn&rsquo;t sure how to go about achieving them. She wanted to be able to do things such as save enough money to buy a house someday, go on vacations and save for retirement. In her own words, Nicole shares how money coaching changed her life.</p><p> Money coaching with Patti has made a positive difference in my outlook on finances and how I run my business. I have always lived paycheck to paycheck and was tired of stressing out about money. When I discovered that Patti was offering money coaching for women, I realized this could help me personally and professionally. Being self-employed, I soon realized that learning proven strategies to help me properly manage my money would be the key to my success.&rdquo;</p><h3> Like anything worthwhile in life, success in finances is built one habit at a time.</h3><p> <br/> Typically, my coaching programs start off with a money personality assessment, which gives incredible insight into your unique money strengths, as well as areas where you may be challenged with money. Everyone&rsquo;s money personality is different. Clients find this work fascinating, which gets them excited to take control of their finances.</p><p> Then, depending on the client&rsquo;s goals, we move to creating new money habits, which once implemented gives clients a tremendous feeling of empowerment.</p><p> For instance, I have found that tracking income and expenses gives a woman a feeling of being in control of her finances, which is one of the main reasons women come to money coaching. It takes her out of fantasy thinking, which tends to keep a woman in denial, or feeling clueless about the reality of her finances.</p><p> Some clients require more process work on the emotional aspects of money, which is my favorite part of coaching, because breakthrough and transformation is what money coaching is all about.</p><p> One of the biggest reasons Nicole benefitted from her program is that she was coachable and open to new possibilities right from the beginning. She didn&rsquo;t let feelings of discomfort keep her stuck or from completing her assignments. She was in integrity with her word, always doing what she said she would do. She took responsibility for her finances.</p><p> Finances and money can always be scary to discuss. Patti made me feel comfortable disclosing this private issue that I had always been nervous and ashamed about. This sense of comfort and trust I felt allowed me to open up and gain a great, successful experience! Taking these skills I learned from our coaching sessions and putting them into effect into my daily routine has tremendously helped me feel more secure and comfortable with my finances. I would highly recommend her services!&rdquo; </p><h3> Money coaching provides a safe place for women to open up and learn how to create a healthy relationship with money despite feelings of vulnerability.</h3><p> <br/> As a retired financial advisor, I believe that money coaching is a powerful resource for women. If the financial services industry truly wanted to serve women, more emphasis would be placed on this area of need.</p><p> For women, the emotional side of money can keep them from making sound financial decisions. Shame around money especially is more common for women than for men. It happens to be one of the reasons they don&rsquo;t reach out to financial professionals for help.</p><p> Patti has given me ideas to implement in my business that have helped me build clientele, promote my services, and most recently, given me courage and ideas to raise my prices while feeling comfortable doing so. Every week, she would have me set a goal for myself to complete the following week. One of my main goals was seeking new clients. I gained 7-8 new clients per month as a result. It felt great to accomplish these goals and to see them being reflected in my work was very motivating!&rdquo;</p><p> For women in business, much of our coaching centers around worthiness and empowerment, which in turn impacts sales and income. This was the case with Nicole. Each week, as she evolved in our work together, she became more empowered to reach her financial and business goals, which resulted in new clients and increased revenue each month.</p><p> Throughout my coaching sessions with Patti, I gained money saving tools, I&rsquo;ve built confidence in myself, set goals and met them, and started saving money which was one of my biggest challenges! By using charts to track my income and expenses each month (which I had never done before), I realized how beneficial this was becoming. I then started saving a percentage of my income per month to go into my savings. Watching that amount grow was motivating and I now save four times that amount per month!&rdquo;  &ndash;Nicole Dethier, Beauty and Image Independent Contractor</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nicole-Dethier-Beauty-and-Image-Independent-Contractor.png\" width=\"290\"/><br/>Nicole Dethier, Beauty and Image Independent Contractor<br/> <p> I&rsquo;m obviously very proud of Nicole, and how she stepped up to the plate to take charge of her finances. As a result, her business and income keeps growing, as does her savings.</p><p> Savings is one of the most powerful assets a woman can have, because it gives her a sense of security. Financial wellbeing comes from feeling secure. It&rsquo;s one of the most important financial goals for women.</p><p> If money coaching is not something you can invest in right now, make a plan to educate yourself about personal finances by investing time reading. That&rsquo;s the most affordable way to become financially literate.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 16:31:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 16:31:01.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_FFHnXgV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-who-take-control-and-step-into-their-money-power/\", \"post_id\": \"10742\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 16:31:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 16:31:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-who-take-control-and-step-into-their-money-power\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10740\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5244\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Women-Who-Take-Control-and-Step-Into-Their-Money-Power.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1047\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462186800,"author_id":375,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5044,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Steps to Take Before You Enter the Real Estate Business","link":"7-steps-to-take-before-you-enter-the-real-estate-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Proper diversification of your investments may include real property. However, purchasing and managing rental property isn't for everyone. Most people are better off diversifying by purchasing REITs (real estate investment trusts) via mutual funds or ETFs.</p><h3> But my friend said she made a killing on real estate.</h3>Unfortunately, most such stories are either not true or fail to factor in all costs. Take the example of Florida over a decade ago: prices were climbing on a monthly, if not weekly basis. However, to achieve good returns, you had to buy well (not pay too much), sell well (not be left holding property after the frothy market collapsed), and cover your costs. Quick flips are taxed at ordinary rates, so having an after-tax profit means selling at a price that covers all you paid to purchase, hold until sale (mortgage interest, property taxes, maintenance), and the costs of sale (usually more than 5% of the gross), plus taxes on the profit &ndash; usually 25% or more.<h3> Sure, but REITs are boring, I want my own properties!</h3>If you are serious about buying and managing rental properties, then you have made a decision to go to the business of being an owner/landlord. (You could also go into real estate for developmental or even quick flip profits, but that's beyond the scope of this post.)I&rsquo;m ready!Not so fast. Before you can hang out with Kar Po Law, John Sobrato and Hawken Xiu Li, take these steps:<h3> <strong>  1. This is a real business!  </strong></h3>Almost everyone has heard a story about people becoming wealthy investing in real estate. However, the stories of true wealth accumulation involve people who dedicated substantial time to running a business investing in real estate.  Just to be clear, claiming you need a massive profit on the sale of your home is neither investing in real estate nor a true profit. Your residence is part of your cost of living. So, before you claim that you profited on the property, you need to factor in all the costs of insuring, maintaining, repairing and improving that residence before sale, as well as the actual costs of sale. Rarely does the net return on a personal residence equal the stock market return over the same time period.<h3> <strong>  2. Get a good market study and do reasonable projections  </strong></h3>For rental real estate, you will need to do your homework just like any other business to determine what is a good market. That is, find out where property values allow you to buy low enough that you can get a good return on your purchase. Part of your return will come from property appreciation. If the market changes and property values decline, you have lost capital.  You want to know what segment of the population is likely to rent from you for a given property and the likelihood of vacancies or late payments. This is sometimes called a market study.  You should anticipate some level of vacancy (times when you don't get collect 100% of the possible rent).  Furthermore, you will want to factor in, and anticipate, the cost for advertising, professional fees (legal and accounting), repairs, supplies, landscaping, snow removal, and so on. Finally, at some point, there will be capital improvements, including anything from a new roof to upgrading electrical systems or changing some part of the internal or external structure. If your anticipated rental income, less an allowance from vacancies, is sufficient to cover the debt service plus all projected expenses, then you should be in good shape.<h3> <strong>  3. Avoid too much leverage (mortgage financing)  </strong></h3>When you have decided on the property, expect to use mortgage financing. This allows you to buy more property. You are counting on rental income to pay the mortgage principal, interest, property taxes and insurance. However, if you put very little down, your payments might be quite high, make it less likely that will cover all those expenses (you may need to put in more and use less mortgage financing). A downturn in property values when you have to sell will mean that you have to bring money to the closing - a bad thing! A change in the local economy, so that you lose tenants, could result in negative cash flow, which means you are effectively adding capital to the property - also bad.<h3> <strong>  4. Form the proper entity to own </strong></h3>Before you buy, you may want to form an entity - an LLC, corporation or trust.  The entity protects your personal assets, because anyone who tries to sue you as the owner can only claim against the value of the property and other assets of the entity.<h3> <strong>  5. Set up all the systems you will need </strong></h3><li> Bookkeeping &ndash; be sure you know how to treat security deposits, both so the money is not income to and so you meet requirements of local laws.</li><li> Legal &ndash; form of entity, rental agreements, local law, zoning &hellip; you are going to want help!</li><li> Tax prep &ndash; be sure you know what you can deduct vs. depreciate and so on;</li><li> Maintenance &ndash; expect to spend time and money on this, or else tenants won't pay rent on time and may leave; and</li><li> The rest - Fire, police, zoning and other contacts.  You may want some form of record keeping for all this, such as rent rolls.</li><h3> <strong>  6. As with our recommendations for starting your own business </strong></h3>Setting up proper bookkeeping and getting legal advice at the outset is crucial. See<u> <a href=\"/advisor/7-things-to-do-when-starting-a-business-to-avoid-nasty-surprises\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  7 things to do when staring a business </a></u>.<h3> <strong>  7. Put your agreement with partners in writing   </strong></h3>If you join with someone, you will want an agreement that makes clear who does what, in terms of funding and time spent. Otherwise, you could end up in an unpleasant disagreement or worse.<h3> <strong>  8. Don&rsquo;t stay too long at the party  </strong></h3>In the example of Florida mentioned above, many people jumped in too late, which helped push up prices for others until the market crashed.  Many people were left stuck with properties valued at less than their mortgages in the mortgages in bust of 2008 and took many years to finally sell.So the flip side of buying well is to recognize when the property so overvalued and sell. If you gauge this well, and if the market later declines in value, you get to redeploy your capital and start over!Wow, that's a lot to keep in mind!<strong> True, but now more prepared to be a landlord of the future.  Good luck!</strong>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 17:23:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 17:23:28.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Vaf87O5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-steps-to-take-before-you-enter-the-real-estate-business/\", \"post_id\": \"10744\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 17:23:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 17:23:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-steps-to-take-before-you-enter-the-real-estate-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10743\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5245\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/7-Steps-to-Take-Before-You-Enter-the-Real-Estate-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1354\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462204800,"author_id":455,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5045,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When Did It Become Ok to Be Financially Illiterate?","link":"when-did-it-become-ok-to-be-financially-illiterate","source_link":null,"content":"<p> April is Financial Literacy Month, and echoing  <a href=\"http://www.kleinadvisors.com/resources/entry/celebrate-retirement-planning-week-create-a-freedom-fund\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  my blog onRetirement Planning Week </a> , all of these dedicated days, weeks, and months get tiresome. But when it comes to financial literacy, I believe the focus is critical. What conerns me is that many people outside the world of financial planning seem to view understanding basic finance as a luxury. For many, it has become acceptable to be financially illiterate. <strong>  Sadly, this is especially true for women; I&rsquo;ve observed far too many otherwise smart women laugh off their lack of financial knowledge, and it sets off all my inner alarm bells. </strong></p><p> <strong>  At the risk of being curt, I will say that ignorance is never cute or endearing. </strong> Can you imagine someone&mdash;anyone&mdash;joking about being illiterate in any other context? Male or female, each of us is responsible for our financial future, and being numerate and understanding basic financial concepts is vital to be sure you&rsquo;re making smart choices along the way.</p><p> If my concern has you wondering about your own financial literacy, now is a great time to review the basics. <strong>  Let&rsquo;s start with three of the biggies: debt, compounding, and the value of a fiduciary: </strong></p><h3> How is good debt different from bad debt?</h3><p> <br/> Debt is a huge problem in the US. In 2015, the average US household held &ldquo;bad debt&rdquo; of more than $15,700 in credit card debt and $27,000 in auto loans, and &ldquo;good debt&rdquo; that included about $48,000 in student loans and $169,000 in home loans. When used wisely, &ldquo;good debt&rdquo; such as a home mortgage, student loans, and business loans has the potential to generate benefits over time (though the decision to assume any debt deserves careful consideration). In contrast, &ldquo;bad debt&rdquo; like auto loans and credit card debt (which is also a loan) reduces your income and adds no value to your wealth. Every month that you don&rsquo;t pay off your credit account in full, you are charged interest, so you&rsquo;re paying more (and more!) for an item that is losing value.</p><h3> What is compounding and how does it affect my retirement savings? </h3><p> <br/> The advice to &ldquo;save early and often&rdquo; is based on the idea of compounding. Simply put, compounding is the ability of an asset to grow exponentially&mdash;to generate earnings, which are then reinvested to generate more earnings. To illustrate: if you invest $1,200 annually beginning at age 25 and that money earns 11% annually (based on the historical long-term average of the S&amp;P 500), in 10 years your savings will reach $22,000. With compounding, in 20 years you&rsquo;ll have saved not just double the amount, but $85,000. In 30 years, that number jumps to $265,000, and in 40 years you&rsquo;ll have socked away $775,000 to help fund your pendingretirement. Time is the Archimedes&rsquo; Lever of investing. The earlier you start saving, the more you can leverage the power of compounding, and the easier it is to meet your goals.</p><h3> What is a fiduciary? </h3><p> <br/> The recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2016/04/05/fiduciary-ruling-investor-adviser-advisor/82655312/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DOL fiduciary rule  </a> </u>  has been making headlines lately, which has put a spotlight on fiduciaries. If the term is new to you, a fiduciary is required to always actin the best interest of the client. This is in contrast to non-fiduciary &ldquo;advisors&rdquo; who may receive a commission for products they recommend, adding their wallet to the list of priorities. Working with a fee-only advisor who is a fiduciary is a necessary part of financial planning. At the same time, it&rsquo;s important to be your own fiduciary. I was recently working with a client whose husband died suddenly at just 52 years old. When I asked about his earnings and their joint assets, she had no clue. &ldquo;When you reviewed your tax return last year, what were the numbers?&rdquo; I asked. She had no idea. Every year she simply signed her name. By paying attention to your taxes, attending meetings with your advisor, and participating in the estate planning process, you can gain financial literacy and actively serve in your best interest.</p><p> Of course, financial literacy isn&rsquo;t just about understanding the terms. It&rsquo;s also about learning how money works in the real world, how to budget and invest, and how to make informed and effective financial decisions to ensure you have the resources you need to support yourself in the future. Start with these three concepts to be sure you&rsquo;re on the right path:</p><p> Set a realistic spending plan that includes emergency and retirement savings.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A study by the Federal Reserve Board  </a> </u>  recently reported the shocking statistic that 47% of respondents said they would have to rely on credit cards or selling belongings to come up with cash for a $400 emergency. To avoid the same fate (or change it if you&rsquo;re already there), review your income and expenses, set a realistic budget, and include building an emergency fund (much more than $400 please!) and &ldquo;saving early and often&rdquo; for retirement as part of your plan.</p><p> Be sure you know the truth about your financial situation: MaryAnn and her husband had been living high on the hog for years. Their extravagant lifestyle included houses, cars, boats, horses, and world travel. Both she and her husband had sizable incomes, and MaryAnn assumed their finances were in great shape. When her husband lost his job, she quickly learned that their lifestyle was a house of cards built on debt. When she and her husband divorced after a 30-year marriage, her choice to remain in the dark about their joint finances had a tremendous impact on her life. No matter how much you trust your partner to take charge of the finances, be sure you know the facts and that you&rsquo;re acting as a fiduciary to you and your family.</p><h3> Work with an advisor you trust: </h3><p> <br/> Unveiling your finances&mdash;especially any financial missteps&mdash;requires a huge amount of trust in any situation. If you were raised to believe that finances should remain a secret, it&rsquo;s time to become a family rebel. Be sure you know the basics, and then put your trust in an advisor who is truly acting in your best interest and can help you get on track financially as quickly as possible.</p><p> Want to learn more about financial planning and how it can impact your life&mdash;today and in the future?  <a href=\"mailto:lauren@kleinadvisors.com\">  Email me </a>  to schedule a time to chat.

{"original_id":5046,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Get Your Energy Unstuck","link":"how-to-get-your-energy-unstuck","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The psychological establishment vilified him.</h3><p> <br/> Wilhelm Reich, the psychiatry-enfant-terrible of the mid-20th century, based his framework for understanding human behavior on the notion of blocked energy. Reich believed that folks who experienced significant challenges in life did so because their energy &ldquo;got stuck&rdquo; sometime during the early stages of life. &ldquo;Getting well&rdquo; meant getting rid of body armor and getting the energy moving again!</p><h3> Reich was ahead of his time.</h3><p> <br/> Think of a work day when nothing seems to flow. A specific project frustrates the heck out of you. A certain personality drives you bonkers. Ugggh. Circumstances can easily conspire to make our bodies very tight. Yep, stuck. Chances are, what is actually stuck that day is our energy. Good news. No early-childhood-trauma-work required here. Instead, when you notice that your energy is stuck, ask yourself: Do I need to plug in? Plug out? Re-plug?</p><p> Plugs are a marvelous metaphor for conducting an energy switch. After all, we plug into a wall socket to behold light. We unplug to make light disappear. We re-plug to shine light somewhere else. Yes, you get the idea. So here are our 3 plug-check basics:</p><h3> <strong>  Plug In: </strong></h3><p> You&rsquo;re bored at a meeting. Choose to plug in. Commit, even if you&rsquo;re not interested. You&rsquo;re distracted in a conversation and do not feel engaged. Choose to plug in. Commit to that conversation, in that moment, with that person. Commit fully. Your energy will immediately reactivate.</p><h3> <strong>  Plug Out: </strong></h3><p> You&rsquo;re hitting the mental wall because you&rsquo;ve stared at the computer screen for too long. Choose to plug out. Stop. Take a break. Look at the window. Get out of your seat. Move. Get a snack. Have a drink (the non-alcoholic kind). Stop. Plug out so you can plug in again.</p><h3> <strong>  Re-plug: </strong></h3><p> You&rsquo;re getting irritable because a colleague is droning on and on about the same old crap. Choose to re-plug. Switch your focus. Instead of fixating on the whiny voice or the repetitiveness of the argument, focus on something inviting. The smile of another colleague. The sun that&rsquo;s peering through the trees outside the office window. The picture of your daughter that sits on your desk. Stay in the moment, but plug into what energizes you, not on what drains.</p><p> Energy is always available to us. It is the gift that keeps on giving. You and I are responsible, moment by moment, for allowing it and directing it. When you feel your energy getting stuck, consider your options. Do I need to plug in? Plug out? Re-plug?</p><p> Make a choice. Energy will do the rest. Sweet.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 17:40:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 17:40:51.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Ys5476S.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-your-energy-unstuck/\", \"post_id\": \"10747\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 17:40:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 17:40:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-your-energy-unstuck\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10746\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5247\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-To-Get-Your-Energy-Unstuck.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"481\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462197600,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5048,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Financial Advisors: Here's How to Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile in 5 Minutes","link":"financial-advisors-heres-how-to-optimize-your-linkedin-profile-in-5-minutes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to  <a href=\"http://www.linkedintoleads.com/why-financial-advisors-cant-afford-to-ignore-linkedin/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Linked Into Leads </a> , 9 in 10 Financial Advisors who use social networks turn to  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">  LinkedIn </a>  as their go-to social media platform. With over 400 million users on LinkedIn, you should focus on connecting with prospects through this giant of a social media platform.</p><p> Here are 4 ways to optimize your LinkedIn profile and convert prospects into clients (I&rsquo;ve used Veriday&rsquo;s, VP Product Management, Andrew Chung as an example below):</p><h3> <strong>  1. You need a picture of yourself. A great LinkedIn picture is: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Clear</li><li> Professional</li><li> Eye catching</li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/linkedin-photo.png\" width=\"725\"/></p><p> You want your picture to resemble what you would look like if you were to shake someone&rsquo;s hand.  Smile and make direct eye contact with the camera so that on an online platform, you mimic that feeling to your audience.</p><p> Having an eye catching picture can also increase traffic to your profile. Think of it this way; if you were to search for a Product Manager on LinkedIn and in the search results, had the option of picking between the two pictures below, whose profile would you likely click?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/linkedin-to-picture-or-not.png\" width=\"508\"/></p><h3> <strong>  2. Personalize your LinkedIn URL </strong></h3><p> <br/> This a fast and simple step in optimizing your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn provides each user with a randomized personal link. Customizing your LinkedIn URL will not only improve your SEO, but it will also look better and more professional.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/linkedin-personalized-url.png\" width=\"710\"/></p><h3> <strong>  3. What does your headline say about you? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t just put your current job title as your headline, that&rsquo;s already visible on your profile. Write something that encompasses who you are and what you have to offer. In our example, Andrew Chung&rsquo;s official role at Veriday is VP, Product Management. Yes, that is his current role &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not the whole story about who Andrew is. Instead he markets himself as a Growth-Driven Product Leader, User Experience Practitioner, and Relentlessly Focused on Customer Success.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/linkedin-headline.png\" width=\"710\"/></p><h3> <strong>  4. What contact information have you made available to your connections? </strong></h3><p> <br/> How can people reach you? Including your contact information is critical to further build connections with people on LinkedIn. This provides your connections with a means to contact you outside of LinkedIn, whether it be through a phone number, email, or social media. Being connected on different mediums is great because it allows you to better market yourself to peers, coworkers, and key decision makers in your industry.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"221\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/linkedin-content-info.png\" width=\"709\"/></p><p> LinkedIn gives you the ability to connect with hundreds and thousands of key decision makers, prospects, and future clients. So, take 5 minutes out of your day and optimize your LinkedIn profile.</p><p> For a more detailed walk-through on optimizing your LinkedIn profile, check out our Webinar,  <u>  Powering Up Your LinkedIn Presence for Success </u> , which was hosted by Andrew Chung himself.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 18:26:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 18:26:51.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_rFU04ny.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-advisors-heres-how-to-optimize-your-linkedin-profile-in-5-minutes/\", \"post_id\": \"10756\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 18:26:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 18:26:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-advisors-heres-how-to-optimize-your-linkedin-profile-in-5-minutes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10750\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5249\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Financial-Advisors-Heres-How-to-Optimize-Your-LinkedIn-Profile-in-5-Minutes.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1253\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462194000,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}

Thought leaders are popular, well respected and connected enough to drive real value to their respective businesses.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t go to school to become a &ldquo;thought leader,&rdquo; nor can you complete a one-off program and earn some kind of certificate or formal recognition as such. Instead, you must implement a series of ongoing personal branding strategies, refine your skill sets and expand your professional connections consistently. On top of all that, you have to introduce new ideas on a near-constant basis, and make sure your name gets recognized by people both in and out of the industry. You become a thought leader by telling people to think about ideas they didn&rsquo;t know they needed to think about. How can you identify such ideas? Easy: Look at what everyone else is saying and decide if saying the opposite makes sense. You&rsquo;d be surprised that it often does.</p><h3> There&rsquo;s only one key point when offering commentary that&rsquo;s contrary to everyone else: Make sure you&rsquo;re right.</h3><p> <br/> Becoming a thought leader will give you and your company wider exposure. It helps you network and find new customers, employees and business partners. Most importantly, you&rsquo;ll improve the world around you.</p><p> A recent  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249034\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  article in Entrepreneur </a>  explains the process of becoming a thought leader in 5 simple to follow steps. We love this post by Jayson Demers, so we&rsquo;ve summarized it for you here:</p><h3> <strong>  1. ESTABLISH A PERSONAL BRAND </strong></h3><p> <br/> Personal brands rest at the heart of many marketing strategies, and thought leadership is a natural extension of the  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247999\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ability to build a reputation </a> . Start out by enhancing or restructuring your existing social media profiles, especially LinkedIn and Twitter, with detailed descriptions of your credentials and career accomplishments. You&rsquo;ll be using these as foundations of your strategy and key channels for social networking.</p><p> Then, establish your own blog or blog on your company&rsquo;s site and start writing on a regular basis. You&rsquo;ll want to establish a nice archive of at least 30 posts before you go any further, and make sure you&rsquo;re updating your blog at least once a week. Syndicate your blogs on your social networks and get involved in groups and chats as you see fit. This is a preliminary step, so don&rsquo;t go over the top at this point. Instead, focus on laying a foundation.</p><h3> <strong>  2. WORK WITH MENTORS AND INFLUENCERS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve established a baseline reputation, start reaching out to potential mentors and other influencers in the industry. They should be relatively easy to find if you&rsquo;re pushing your content socially, and some of them might find you naturally without you lifting a finger.</p><p> Once you find a handful that are willing to work with you, stand back and observe. Talk to them about what&rsquo;s on their minds. Watch how they operate their own businesses. Read what they push to their blogs. The goal here is to learn from them, and to learn to think how they think. After all, you&rsquo;re going to be emulating them by step five.</p><h3> <strong>  3. NETWORK LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT </strong></h3><p> <br/> Continue working with your influencers and mentors &ndash; that should never fully go away &ndash; but once you&rsquo;ve become more familiar with the territory and the quality of your blog posts goes up, you can start networking with a heavier hand. Get involved on as many social media platforms as possible, and reach out to new people regularly. Attend in-person networking events and seek out speaking opportunities at live events. The more people that are in your network, the more authority you&rsquo;ll have, and the weightier your words will be.</p><h3> <strong>  4. GET PUBLISHED &ndash; OFTEN </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your blog is only the beginning. By this time, you should have a steady stream of regular readers who occasionally comment on and share your blogs. It&rsquo;s time to take things to the next level. Start publishing guest posts on other industry-related blogs, and once you&rsquo;re comfortable, start seeking publication on wider, more authoritative sources.</p><p> For example, you could get yourself published in an industry magazine or on one of the leading publication channels online. You&rsquo;ll want to get work published on a wide range of different sources, and the more often you do it, the bigger your audience will grow.</p><h3> <strong>  5. MAKE BOLDER CLAIMS AND DRIVE NEWER THINGS </strong></h3><p> <br/> At this point, you&rsquo;ve established your reputation as an authority in the industry, and there&rsquo;s only one more step to take: you have to become a leader, and to do that, you have to do new things. Start making bolder claims in your articles, and making bigger predictions about the future of your industry.</p><p> Drive change and innovation in your own business, and publicize those efforts. With your authority already established, people will immediately begin to see you as a bona fide thought leader.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t try to follow all these steps in a day. Developing a personal brand and becoming a thought leader is a process that takes years, even if you put your full effort into it. No matter how much it might seem that way, nobody becomes a success overnight. You&rsquo;ll have to work hard, and consistently, if you want to attain the coveted yet unofficial title of &ldquo;thought leader.&rdquo;</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 18:39:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 18:39:14.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_K1AOJc8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-become-a-financial-services-thought-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"10758\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 18:39:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 18:39:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-become-a-financial-services-thought-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10757\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5250\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Become-a-Financial-Services-Thought-Leader.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"330\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462190400,"author_id":438,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5050,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Marvel Studio Shows Us How Organization Change Can Earn Billions","link":"marvel-studio-shows-us-how-organization-change-can-earn-billions","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Chances are, you probably hadn't heard of Iron Man eight years ago unless you were a die-hard comic book fan. But now the character has headlined multiple films and become a king of the box office. The producer, Marvel Studios, wasn't even making movies before 2008. How did they transform themselves into the creators of a multibillion-dollar franchise?</p><h3> <strong>  Starting With Nothing </strong></h3><p> <br/> Before Marvel Studios made its own movies, its parent company, Marvel Entertainment, licensed out its most popular comic book properties to other studios. 20th Century Fox and Sony/Columbia Pictures hold the reins of the X-Men, Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four. That means that when Marvel Studios wanted to self-finance films, it didn't have access to the characters that the average moviegoer is most likely to know.</p><p> So what did the company do? It adapted. It took lesser-known characters like Iron Man and the Hulk and released two films in 2008 that made over $800 million. And it's only gotten better from there.</p><h3> <strong>  Dreaming Big </strong></h3><p> <br/> Marvel Studios  <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  took a creative risk </a>  by aiming to create a shared universe that would have characters crossing over into each other's movies. Now, looking back at the success of its 2012 team-up film The Avengers, it's easy to say that the idea makes sense. But at the time, there hadn't been anything like it, and no real reason to believe Marvel would succeed.</p><p> And it wasn't easy. Coordinating several multimillion-dollar films meant writers and directors had to work within certain limitations, and actors had to sign contracts for multiple movies. The 10-figure box office return from The Avengers was a pretty nice reward, though.</p><h3> <strong>  A Unified Push </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the things that makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe possible is the fact that Marvel Studios is completely dedicated to it. As  <a href=\"http://comicsalliance.com/marvel-studios-success-marvel-movies-diversity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Andrew Wheeler of ComicsAlliance points out </a> :</p><p> \"Look at Marvel's competitors and it becomes clear that superhero movies are not their sole priority. There are people at Warner Bros. who never have to think about Batman.</p><p> \"There is no one at Marvel Studios who doesn't have to think about Captain America.\"</p><h3> <strong>  Reaching The Audience </strong></h3><p> <br/> Wheeler also notes that Marvel Studios is targeting multiple demographics with its movies. There's something for everyone&mdash;men and women, American and overseas audiences. From the decades of comic book history at its fingertips, the studio is choosing to include female and nonwhite characters even if it means changing from the original version. It's a smart way of bringing the classic comic books into the modern era.</p><h3> <strong>  Universal Lessons From The Marvel Universe </strong></h3><p> <br/> You might not run a movie-making business, but that doesn't mean you can't learn from Marvel Studios' example:</p><li> Adapt to circumstances, whether it's a resource shortage, technological advances, or personnel changes.</li><li> Be bold and create goals that will challenge and advance your organization. Even if no one's done it before&mdash;especially if no one's done it before.</li><li> Get everyone on board so that your efforts all push toward the same finish line.</li><li> Reevaluate your customer base and see if you need to find new ways to reach your market. <br/>  </li><p> Take your cue from Marvel, and you'll be an organizational change superhero.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 18:53:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 18:53:35.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Hou3aLH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/marvel-studio-shows-us-how-organization-change-can-earn-billions/\", \"post_id\": \"10760\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 18:53:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 18:53:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"marvel-studio-shows-us-how-organization-change-can-earn-billions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10759\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5251\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Marvel-Studio-Shows-Us-How-Organization-Change-Can-Earn-Billions.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"3235\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462215600,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5051,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Make Good Ideas the Casualty of a Marketing Metrics War","link":"dont-make-good-ideas-the-casualty-of-a-marketing-metrics-war","source_link":null,"content":"<p> At an excellent digital networking event organised by recruitment firm  <a href=\"http://3search.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  3Search </a>  late last year one of the co-founders of  <a href=\"http://www.fundingcircle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Funding Circle </a>  remarked that amongst the lessons he had learned was that however hard they focused on optimising their digital marketing activity, a really good idea from one of their agencies could lift their response rates markedly. </p><p> This might not sound particularly ground breaking but it resonated with me because I have hit the same issue in a variety of client situations in the last couple of years.  I came back to the point this week inspired by a video from Bain. In &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W3slhrnkb_4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The math behind marketing magic  </a> </u> &rdquo;, Bain&rsquo;s Laura Beaudin talks about multi-variant testing saying that marketing has got faster but also a whole lot more effective, but cautions that &ldquo;creating brand, magic and lifelong loyalty, and those things are much harder to measure with a precise ROI&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;some of the best marketers are those that are able to be balanced about what can be measured and what can&rsquo;t so that they are not losing the magic in what they are doing&rdquo;.</p><p> It&rsquo;s very easy to get stuck in the weeds in the face of the challenge of delivering campaigns over multiple touch points, countries, web platforms and so on.  Martec&rsquo;s recently updated  <a href=\"http://chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/marketing_technology_landscape_2016_3000px.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  marketing technology landscape </a>  infographic shows just how complex life has become.</p><p> The trouble with focusing on excellent tactical execution however is that it can be limiting from the off.  </p><p> Put it this way - what&rsquo;s the point of split testing a weak idea to find out which version of that weak idea performs better?</p><p> A periodic  audit of how you develop and plan for campaigns  is a good idea.  An external perspective can help re-inject some of that missing magic.  Failing that before you look at those metrics again consider the following questions:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Have you actually got an idea? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Understanding the difference between ideas and tactics is crucial. Good ideas are hard. They come from an understanding of a firm's business, its market, its clients&rsquo; wants, needs and desires.  Ideally an idea will be specific to your brand &ndash; something only you can say.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Do you know enough about your audience?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> I remain amazed at the number of large firms who labour over website metrics  in an effort to identify what content their audience prefers when asking them might yield a better answer and again would get over the fact that content A might just be less boring than content B but that really they don&rsquo;t care that much about either.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Have you retained some perspective?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Too much analysis can dull the brain if you aren&rsquo;t careful.  I&rsquo;ve seen a myriad of executions suffer from this.  My favourite being the split test that concluded the audience preferred option A which talked about regulatory change &ndash; missing entirely the fact that option A tested better not because of the audiences&rsquo; interest in regulation but because it was offering something for free!</p><h3> <strong>  4. Have you moved away from your desk? </strong></h3><p> <br/> We all do it.  The working day is long and we have so much to plough through.  But often those that struggle most with ideas are, in my experience, those who have been most silo&rsquo;d &ndash; away from the client or the front line sales team, starved of insight.  Involving other parts of your business, agency suppliers from other projects, other departments (compliance, IT, HR) is rarer than it ought to be as is looking at what works with your customer base in other sectors.  Insularity rarely encourages creativity. </p><h3> <strong>  5. Have you been just a little bit brave?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The pressure to deliver may be ever present but playing it too safe is rarely a winning strategy. According to Adam Grant from Wharton in an excellent piece in Harvard Business Review about  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/03/how-to-build-a-culture-of-originality\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  building a culture of originality </a> : &ldquo;Research suggests that organisations often get stuck in a rut because they&rsquo;re playing defence, trying to stave off the competition. To encourage people to think differently and generate more ideas, put them on offence.&rdquo;</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-01 19:08:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-01 19:08:30.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_BdvPJH4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-make-good-ideas-the-casualty-of-a-marketing-metrics-war/\", \"post_id\": \"10762\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-01 19:08:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-01 19:08:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-make-good-ideas-the-casualty-of-a-marketing-metrics-war\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10761\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5252\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dont-Make-Good-Ideas-the-Casualty-of-a-Marketing-Metrics-War.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1349\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462212000,"author_id":167,"chart_url":""}

Reset Your Thinking to Avoid Uncertainty and Fear","link":"approaching-retirement-reset-your-thinking-to-avoid-uncertainty-and-fear","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you are like most people, you find comfort in a certain level of stability and routine. After all, during years of working and child-raising, routine is the name of the game. You get up, shower, dress, eat breakfast and off to work. Days flow into weeks, weeks flow into months, years and decades&mdash;before you recover from the whiplash of what-the-heck-just happened, retirement is staring you square in the face.</p><p> Retirement can be a source of great anxiety and uncertainty. Think about it, perhaps for the first time, you are confronted with unallocated swathes of time, expenses that can vary greatly and the realization that life doesn&rsquo;t go on forever. Fear can spread like crabgrass while you consider whether you&rsquo;ll outlive your nest egg. Going from the accumulation phase of your life to the dispersion can be emotionally challenging and the &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo; can become debilitating if you let them.</p><h3> Here are a few tips to help reset your Retirement thinking:  <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Create a 5-year vision statement <br/>  </h3><p> Include your thoughts about your lifestyle, important occasions, your social life, your intellectual pursuits, your health and your community. Really write about what gives you the greatest joy and satisfaction.</p><h3> 2. Imagine a typical week in retirement <br/>  </h3><p> What will get you out of bed in the morning? What is your purpose? If you&rsquo;re thinking, I&rsquo;m going to sleep until 11 AM every day, know that probably won&rsquo;t last too long. And then the panic sets in. How will you fill your days? Think social outings, learning opportunities, babysitting duties, part time jobs, yoga classes, travel or long walks in the neighborhood. Regardless of what ultimately fills your calendar, make sure it&rsquo;s meaningful for your health, emotional well-being and happiness. If you&rsquo;re struggling to find things to do, it might be time to do some soul searching, join a group or pick up a copy of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Retire, Rewire&rdquo; (by Jeri Sedlar and Rick Miners) to get your juices flowing.</p><h3> 3. Understand your current money situation <br/>  </h3><p> Know the division between your fixed costs and your discretionary expenses. Create a list of your outflows (expenses) and designate three columns: Fixed Costs (rent, loan repayments), Discretionary-Slightly Controllable(food, utilities), Discretionary-Very Controllable (vacations, entertainment).</p><h3> 4. Decide which insurance coverage you&rsquo;ll require <br/>  </h3><p> Going forward, think beyond your employee benefits to plans such as Medicare supplements or long-term care. What risk can you bear vs. the risk you choose to transfer&mdash;for a cost&mdash;to insurance? Weigh the difference between low deductible-high premium and high deductible-lower premium options.</p><h3> 5. Create a spending plan that focuses on what you value most <br/>  </h3><p> Would you rather put your resources into extensive travel instead of maintaining a larger residence? Think, I want &ldquo;this&rdquo; more than &ldquo;that&rdquo;.</p><h3> 6. Recognize that transitions are tough for most people <br/>  </h3><p> If you are one who finds this especially difficult, find a therapist who can help you work through the transition. Consider the idea that the pain of remaining where you are is greater than the pain of working through your situation to a satisfying conclusion.</p><p> Retirement is &ldquo;your time&rdquo; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy or simple. Like learning any new skill, it takes the willingness to learn, a little patience and the real desire to get through the bumps to enjoy a more satisfying and meaningful life.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 15:19:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 15:19:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_7SHanEb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/approaching-retirement-reset-your-thinking-to-avoid-uncertainty-and-fear/\", \"post_id\": \"10764\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 15:19:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 15:19:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"approaching-retirement-reset-your-thinking-to-avoid-uncertainty-and-fear\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10763\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5253\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Approaching-Retirement-Reset-Your-Thinking-to-Avoid-Uncertainty-and-Fear.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"920\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462284000,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

It may feel like a bonus, but it actually is your repayment from the government of an interest-free loan you&rsquo;ve made to Uncle Sam. While it&rsquo;s been in his hands, that money hasn&rsquo;t been available to earn interest or buy necessities for you.</p><p> Because a tax refund can feel like a windfall, it&rsquo;s tempting to use it to splurge on something fun. Every year, a host of personal finance articles recommend otherwise. Some of the common suggestions for wise use of a tax refund include: <br/> <br/> 1. Build up your emergency fund. <br/> 2. Pay down debt, especially high-interest credit card debt. <br/> 3. Add to your retirement savings; start an IRA or contribute to an existing one. <br/> 4. Put the money toward a necessary large purchase like a replacement furnace or car repair. <br/> 5. Open or add to 529 college savings plans for your kids.</p><p> All of these are good ideas. But before you take anyone else&rsquo;s recommendation (including mine) for the wisest way to use your tax refund, assess your family&rsquo;s particular needs. It&rsquo;s important for spouses to do this together.</p><p> For example, if you or your spouse are facing possible layoffs at work, the best place for your tax refund is probably your emergency fund. If you have credit card debt that is adding stress to your budget, using the refund to pay all or part of it might be your wisest choice. If the car is on its last wheels, maybe the tax refund can help you buy a newer one. </p><p> If you have little or no debt and are comfortable with your spending and saving habits, you have more leeway to regard a tax refund as discretionary income. You might be able to choose between adding to a retirement fund, saving for college, or taking a family vacation. I would recommend focusing on building a solid emergency reserve and fully funding retirement accounts ahead of putting money into college funds for the kids.</p><p> As you and your spouse look at your family&rsquo;s specific needs and wants, I suggest considering your options for using a tax refund in light of one important question: &ldquo;Which choice will do the most to increase our financial well-being?&rdquo;</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve decided how to use this year&rsquo;s tax refund, you can increase your financial well-being even further with one more step. Look at how much you pay throughout the year, both in withholding and estimated tax payments. If your tax bill has consistently been less than your payments, or if it is likely to be lower over the next few years, adjust your withholding and estimated tax payments accordingly.</p><p> Given the current low interest rates, it may seem pointless to worry about overpaying your taxes. You don&rsquo;t earn any interest from the government, but you won&rsquo;t earn much from a bank or credit union, either. Even so, having emergency cash in a savings account that earns even a little bit of interest is a far better option than paying interest on a credit card. Or if you can put that money into an IRA, you may gain some tax benefits.</p><p> The bottom line is that a tax refund is not &ldquo;found&rdquo; money. It&rsquo;s your money. It can&rsquo;t contribute to your family&rsquo;s financial well-being while it&rsquo;s tied up on loan to Uncle Sam.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 15:32:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 15:32:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_MNfpNWW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/finally-got-your-tax-refund-what-to-do-next-to-better-your-financial-future/\", \"post_id\": \"10765\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 15:32:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 15:32:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"finally-got-your-tax-refund-what-to-do-next-to-better-your-financial-future\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10763\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5254\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Approaching-Retirement-Reset-Your-Thinking-to-Avoid-Uncertainty-and-Fear.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"384\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462280400,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

I learned a lot and began thinking about what makes a great story. How do you create an emotional connection through storytelling?</p><h3> 1) Keep it simple</h3><p> The best stories are simple and have a compelling message that creates an emotional response in the listener. Remember, the listener owns the emotion; as the story teller you can only paint a picture; the listener adds the color.</p><h3> 2) Make it interesting</h3><p> Include those tidbits that created an emotion in you, regardless of how insignificant it may seem to you. If you felt an emotional response; a tingle, a tear, a shiver, a smile or a bell laugh then likely, you will help your audience feel the same.</p><h3> 3) Include the hard stuff</h3><p> Be vulnerable, allow your listener to experience the painful, uncomfortable moments with you. As you talk about the hard stuff, a certain trust will develop that allows you to communicate to connect on a level that makes the story impactful and memorable for your listener.</p><h3> 4) Understand your audience</h3><p> Who are you speaking to? Do a little research beforehand. If that isn&rsquo;t possible, assess the setting. What&rsquo;s the demographic, the setting, is there a theme, how much time do you have, what do you want them to remember about their experience with you?</p><p> Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words.

{"original_id":5055,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Selling: The Importance of Making Clients Understand the Value of Your Solution","link":"selling-the-importance-of-making-clients-understand-the-value-of-your-solution","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When it comes to selling technology, many sales people are trained or conditioned to sell the whistles and bells of their product or service (i.e. &ndash; the features), in an attempt to convince prospects of their offering being better than the competition&rsquo;s. They focus on the technical (often slight) differences and advantages that their technology brings to the table, rather than positioning value.</p><p> One danger of that approach is that very often the discussion ends up to be price focused. You can imagine many technologies offer similar features and the differences, right? While these features are important  to the company who sells the technology, they might not be seen immediately as of value to the prospect.</p><p> So, let&rsquo;s start from here: It&rsquo;s really NOT about the technology; it&rsquo;s about what VALUE your specific technology solution can bring to your prospect&rsquo;s business. </p><p> And how do we do that? Right! You guessed it! By asking the right questions at the right time AND actively listening AND positioning your solution as relevant to your customer&rsquo;s goals. Just rattling of your pitch is NOT going to get you very far in this day and age of the educated and curious buyer.</p><p> The goal in every interaction with the prospect should be to discover what is of unique value to that particular individual and then provide a sensible solution accordingly.</p><h3> Finding the Right Person to Target</h3><p> <br/> Tailor your messages to the need of the person you are engaging with. Technology sales people tend to lead with technology, even when they talk to decision makers who are not tech savvy. This often leads to the prospects being overwhelmed and/or confused.</p><p> Technology details are only relevant to the person who is a tech buyer, the person who understands the differences and nuances when it comes to technology. That person is seldom the person who writes the checks. Economic buyers however are always interested in what the technology can do for their business, in other words how it can help them make or save money or time</p><h3> Why Not Start Prospecting from the Top?</h3><p> <br/> It is very tempting for technology sales people to target technical buyers, but it&rsquo;s not always the right approach. If you, as a sales person can identify how your prospect company could benefit from your solution, you might be better off targeting higher level executives, such as the CEO, the CTO, COO, etc. If your technology can help companies make or save money, then (and you can bet your money on this) you will get the attention from senior management. It&rsquo;s all about doing your research and crafting the right message.  It&rsquo;s also a lot easier to work your way down within an organization, than to climb up the organizational ladder.</p><h3> Avoid Getting Stuck in the Middle (Mid-Level Management)</h3><p> <br/> Mid-management is often protective of their turf and they very rarely have final decision-making power. So, if you engage with them (even if they are responsive), you will have to rely on them to communicate the value of your solution to their management, the people who will give final approval. Why would you want to risk that? If you, however, get buy-in from top management first, and they then involve the technical experts or management, you can be assured that your sales cycle will be shorter.</p><h3> Lead with Value</h3><p> <br/> Again, it&rsquo;s not about the technology, but what the technology can do for that organization. That proposition might be different for every single company, so you will need to do your research. In the end it will pay off. If you offer a technology that can help companies stay connected to the internet without interruptions (like one of our clients), focus on the value that solution brings to this client. Losing internet connection these days can have devastating effects on companies, but the consequences might differ depending on the industry. In the public sector, it might mean that ambulances don&rsquo;t get to an accident scene on time. In a retail environment the effects might be less drastic, but very costly. If your client&rsquo;s employees can&rsquo;t open hundreds or more of their cash registers due to a lost connection, it can result in lost revenue.</p><h3> Higher Pricing Not an Issue? How To Do That?</h3><p> <br/> Here is the lesson to learn for sales people who sell technology enabled solutions. Higher price might not be an issue, as long as the solution that you are offering is relevant to the individual who is buying it and they feel it&rsquo;s worth it. Personally, I don&rsquo;t mind paying more if I actually get more, but that&rsquo;s up to the sales person to help me understand. Good sales people help clients understand the value of their solution and why the cheaper solution might have downfalls.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 17:11:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 17:11:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_uro27uZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/selling-the-importance-of-making-clients-understand-the-value-of-your-solution/\", \"post_id\": \"10769\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 17:11:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 17:11:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"selling-the-importance-of-making-clients-understand-the-value-of-your-solution\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10768\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5256\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Selling-The-Importance-of-Making-Clients-Understand-the-Value-of-Your-Solution.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"581\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462295700,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}

I was 12, living in New Zealand, and on Wednesday, November 28, I saw their perfect record change: a scenic flight to Antarctica ploughed into Mt. Erebus, killing all 257 passengers aboard.</p><p> Eventually the reasons came to light. Primary among them was that a single incorrect course coordinate was entered into the flight navigation system on the plane. While the error was a meagre 2 degrees off, after the plane had been flying a little more than five hours, it, and the 257 people on board, were 28 miles to the east of where they were meant to be, and no one realized it.</p><p> Believing everything was fine, the pilots descended in order to give the passengers a better view of the icy terrain. Unfortunately they didn&rsquo;t realize they were actually directly in front of, and flying toward, Mt Erebus. At 12:49pm, the plane flew into the mountainside, immediately killing everyone on board.</p><p> Even deviating by a single degree can take you far off course in a journey, leaving you a huge distance from where you initially intended to end up. Circumnavigate the globe in a plane beginning at the equator and diverge by one degree and you&rsquo;ll end up approximately 500 miles off course by the time you complete the trip. Consider the amount of wasted time and fuel. </p><p> What seemingly small, slightly off habits or approaches are part of your regular routine? What processes do you know aren&rsquo;t really as they should be, but you justify as &ldquo;not really that big of a deal&rdquo; that will eventually damage your business? Your relationships? Your health?</p><p> King Solomon, one of the wisest people to ever live, encouraged his readers to catch the foxes that destroy crops. But not just any foxes; he specifically said the &ldquo;little foxes.&rdquo; He described the smaller foxes, the smallest pests, as the ones that do the worst damage.</p><p> So it is when we neglect small, distracted actions; tolerate indifference to priorities; and excuse sloppy behavior and a lack of self-control. We might only do this briefly from time to time, yet over a year, or five, or ten, the cost adds up. It can make a significant difference to where we might have arrived if we had better monitored the &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; details.</p><h3> Challenge: Are you trying to remember meeting details from the previous day, instead of immediately recording them in your CRM after your appointment, when you remember best?</h3><p> <br/> Solution: Schedule extra time after your portfolio reviews specifically for entering notes. Don&rsquo;t get distracted with answering email until your notes are properly entered and the follow-up next &ldquo;to-do&rsquo;s&rdquo; are set for your client.</p><h3> Challenge: Do you fritter away the first five minutes of your morning at your office while your computer system boots up?</h3><p> <br/> Solution: Before leaving each day, write your three main tasks you wish to begin and complete tomorrow. Leave the piece of paper on your desk. As your system is coming to life, begin the first step of the first task and build momentum from the beginning of your day.</p><h3> Challenge: Do you struggle to get to bed at a reasonable hour?</h3><p> <br/> Solution: Like a high-performance athlete, your body and mind needs rest to recover to continue performing well tomorrow. Set a time to be in bed&mdash;say 9 p.m. At 8:30 p.m. begin the steps to be in bed by 9:</p><li> screens (ALL screens!) are turned off: laptop, home computer, phone &ndash; all off. This allows your mind to begin relaxing. (Light from mobile phones ensures your brain remains alert and active.)</li><li> resist eating an hour before bed.</li><li> wash, brush your teeth, and get into bed. Set your alarm. Read a little, if you like, (preferably not business material) with the light dimmed, and then turn your light off and let your mind rest. <br/>  </li><h3> Challenge: Can&rsquo;t seem to get quality time with your partner or children?</h3><p> <br/> Solution: Set an hour appointment each week for an individual date time with each member of your family. That hour is for you and that family member only. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a fancy or expensive event. You can walk/sit in silence, cook a meal together, or go for a drive. Just give the person you love your undivided attention during that time you are together.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 17:17:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 17:17:21.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_XPLZ8vN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-air-new-zealands-first-crash-in-1979/\", \"post_id\": \"10771\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 17:17:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 17:17:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-entrepreneurs-can-learn-from-air-new-zealands-first-crash-in-1979\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10770\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5257\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Entrepreneurs-Can-Learn-from-Air-New-Zealands-First-Crash-in-1979.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"438\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462273200,"author_id":378,"chart_url":""}

While this system has served me well &ndash; allowing me to raise two wonderful sons and build a successful business &ndash; there were many times along the way that I had a nagging sense there was more to life than my limited and rigid imagination had a plan for.</p><h3> <strong>  So why is the concept of &ldquo;letting go&rdquo; important? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Well consider this: By continually following my &ldquo;plan&rdquo; with unwavering determination &ndash; even when I felt that there was something more or different I should consider &ndash; I closed myself off to the potential of obtaining that &ldquo;something more&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I am grateful for all that I have in my life and would never change the outcomes. However, &ldquo;letting go&rdquo; and being more open to other possibilities along the way could have opened doors that made the journey easier or the outcomes even more abundant.</p><h3> Why do so many people &ldquo;hang on&rdquo; to things that may not serve them best?</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Hanging on&rdquo; is comfortable and safe&mdash;or at least it feels that way. When you hang on to what you perceive as &ldquo;known&rdquo;, you feel you have a greater level of control than you do of the unknown. In reality though, life still goes on around you, changing with every moment, leaving you with far less control than you realize&mdash;whether you hang on or not. In my case, I was hanging on to the influences of my own upbringing; the steadfast, rigid determination I inherited from my father. In my mind, to do it any other way would mean letting go of the only way I thought was possible or even allowable. The fear of what was around another corner left me paralyzed, hanging onto the wheel and continuing down the only path I knew.</p><p> We all have a vision or plan for our lives, yet so many &ldquo;hang on&rdquo; to things that no longer fit into that vision&mdash;or maybe it&rsquo;s the plan that&rsquo;s changed. So instead of letting go or accepting change, we find some level of false comfort in the inertia of remaining where we are&mdash;clinging to what&rsquo;s familiar. Campbell&rsquo;s mandate gives us permission to follow our bliss, perhaps feeling the fear, but doing it (whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; is) anyway. Doing so allows doors to open and turns unpredictability into creative possibility.</p><p> I&rsquo;m reminded of my friend Laura who took early retirement from her corporate job in order to turn her painting hobby and passion into a full time endeavor. Or my friend and yoga teacher, Jen, who left a high paying marketing job to teach yoga full time because she knew it was what she was meant to do. In both cases, they left great jobs and &ldquo;threw caution to the wind&rdquo; so to speak, and let go of what they felt was holding them back from actually living their best business lives.</p><p> But as Campbell stated, we must be &ldquo;willing to let go&rdquo;&mdash;and while it may seem easier said than done, it is far easier when you are aware of what you are actually letting go of and what potential waits on the other side.</p><h3> You can start to gain that awareness by taking your time, digging deep and asking yourself these 5 questions: <br/>  </h3><li> What do you like about what you are hanging on to? You may find there&rsquo;s actually nothing you like about it. Consider that old sweater that you&rsquo;ve had for years. It&rsquo;s been sitting in your closet, unworn for more than a decade, yet you just can&rsquo;t part with it.</li><li> How does what you are hanging on to fulfill you? About that job that you hate to get up for in the morning: Sure it&rsquo;s a steady paycheck, but do you really think nothing better exists? Have you even explored what else is out there?</li><li> What will you gain by letting go? So many people focus on what they&rsquo;ll lose, when you should really be focusing on what you may potentially gain! Thinking back to that job again: you may not only gain a better role, you may find that better pay and benefits await you.</li><li> How will letting go help you grow as a person? This is an important question that many do not consider. We have such a limited time in life to see and do the things that enrich our minds and bodies; living with a bad situation or relationship simply stifles oneself as a person, limits opportunity, and takes away your right to live a life that is fulfilling and joyful.</li><li> What are you REALLY afraid of? What I&rsquo;ve come to know is that fear, uncertainty and discomfort can be our best compasses for growth. Those emotions that I have always looked at as familiar foes can actually be my friend. What I accept, I can actually move beyond. To be willing to see these negative emotions as opportunities for growth, you can turn negatives into positives, and view them as a sign from your higher self, pushing you towards abundance.</li><p> Letting go may seem scary, but hanging on to the souvenirs of a life that no longer serves your best interest is even scarier. Your Best Business Life awaits you; be willing to let go, opening your heart and mind to the possibilities.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 17:25:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 17:25:04.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_CPuxrCW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-is-the-concept-of-letting-go-important/\", \"post_id\": \"10772\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 17:25:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 17:25:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-is-the-concept-of-letting-go-important\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10770\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5258\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Entrepreneurs-Can-Learn-from-Air-New-Zealands-First-Crash-in-1979.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"879\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462289400,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

What if there were tech glitches? What if people saw how awkward, nervous, and human I really am? <br/>  </li><p> As my thoughts spiraled, I took a deep breath and asked myself: \"What would I tell a client in this situation to do?\"</p><p> Thankfully, I didn't have to stretch my imagination too far. I'm lucky enough to work with smart, motivated, and incredibly talented people. And since I created this training to help them take back their time, shift their mindset, and bust through their roadblocks, I took my own advice and recommitted to the tools and systems that helped me manage my ADD, deal with Depression, overcome obstacles, and ultimately, create a life I love. </p><p> Sometimes, we all get off track. And seeing how these systems helped me to overcome my fears and excuses in such a short time, I became even more excited to stop procrastinating so I could share this training with you.</p><p> So last week, after Mark graciously (and patiently) spent 10.5 hours recording/rerecording/assuring me that I don't have lipstick on my teeth, I wondered why on earth I waited so long. </p><p> It felt amazing to create something I love.

But, then, neither is their comeback in a recovery that has offered low interest rates and depressed real estate prices. In fact, real estate is so widely acknowledged as a distinct and important asset type that it will receive its own sector classification this year, separating it from the financial services sector. And equity REIT ETFs that offer baskets of various-sized REITs may present a liquid and low-cost way to invest in this newest 11th asset sector.</p><p> First of all, for those not familiar with this investment vehicle, REIT is the acronym for Real Estate Investment Trust, a real estate company that holds real assets (actual properties) and offers common shares to the public, similar to other stocks. REITs are unique, however, in that their sole business is the development and/or management of income-producing properties, and they are bound by regulation to distribute 90% of their taxable profits as dividends, thereby avoiding corporate income tax. (For the record, there is a small class of REITs that hold mortgages and mortgage derivatives and are essentially finance companies. This sub-industry will remain in the financial services classification. Today we are focused solely on equity REITs that hold hard assets.)</p><p> The year 2015 saw a fairly major sell-off of REITs due to fears of rising interest rates. Those fears, however, may be unfounded. Historically, in periods of rising interest rates, landlords have been able to increase occupancy and rents and, consequently, generate greater cash flow and dividends. In fact, currently REITs are trading at steep discount while paying much higher dividends than bonds and the stock market. <a href=\"https://blog.flexshares.com/real-estate-etfs-smart-way-to-further-diversify-portfolio#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a></p><h3> If you haven&rsquo;t already done so, now may be the time to add Real Estate ETFs to your portfolio.</h3><p> <br/> Note, however, that there are many different approaches to this asset class among various ETFs, including company size, property specializations or domestic vs. global REITs. Investors need to do their homework to choose which approach best fits their portfolio.</p><p> Market capitalization is important to proper portfolio diversification because there are different levels of risk between large- and small-cap stocks. So investors should understand the size of the holdings in various REIT ETFs. ETFs that create baskets of large-cap REITs (those that have huge global asset bases and capital-raising expertise) have benefitted most in recent years. As investors have flocked to large REITs, distribution yields, which is the amount of cash flow received or paid out by a REIT, have fallen. Now, with an improving U.S. economy, our strengthening dollar and continuing turmoil overseas, such large cap companies may not be able to offer the same near-term growth as their nimbler, smaller cap cousins that are focused entirely on domestic assets.</p><p> There are other important differences among REIT ETFs also. The largest category is diversified funds, which hold many property types including office, residential and hotels and lodging. A few specialize in residential REITs that own properties in high-rent markets such as New York and Los Angeles. Still others focus on retail REITs. And, as mentioned above, you&rsquo;ll find several global REIT ETFs that offer exposure to real estate assets in foreign countries.</p><p> Whatever your risk appetite or choice of real estate asset type, real estate&rsquo;s potential to generate income and hedge against inflation may serve investors well in their investment portfolio. For many investors, owning REITs through Exchange Traded Funds may be the appropriate investment vehicle to help them achieve their financial goals.</p><h3> To learn more about FlexShares, contact our team at 1-855-FlexETF (1-855-353-9383) or visit us  <u>  here </u> . <br/>  </h3><a href=\"https://blog.flexshares.com/real-estate-etfs-smart-way-to-further-diversify-portfolio#_ftnref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1]</a> Ky Trang Ho. &ldquo;Make Like The Donald: Best REITs and REIT ETFs To Buy Now.&rdquo; Forbes.

Fears that are so deep-rooted that it can take years before you get to fully know and understand your client. Since fears can keep your client from providing the right information to build a trusting relationship, another important question must be explored.</p><p> What makes a prospect or new client divulge the necessary information in a relatively short period of time? <strong>  Trust. </strong></p><p> So while you are building trust by asking all the right open-ended questions with the prospect, they are assessing you to see if your answers address their fears.</p><h3> The Three Hidden Fears of Clients are: <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1. Does the advisor really care about me? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Interestingly enough, this has a lot to do with both trust and instincts.  As an advisor, if you are not innately a trusting person, that will come across unless you are behaviorally aware and can modify your style. Overlay that with the clients innate level of trust and depending on the conversation, you could have an uphill battle to win over the trust of the prospect.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Am I good enough? Will the advisor think I am a failure or not making the right decisions? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Prospects that are very goal and task driven will be acutely sensitive to this. But on the surface, they can come across as very decisive and successful individuals. Vulnerability and giving away control will come very slowly with this type of person.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Does the advisor have enough experience both technically and with people like me? </strong></h3><p> <br/> They can ask you about degrees and designations but they might be looking to speak with current clients. Prospects that are much more outgoing and relationship driven can seem to be only interested in the people side of the business, but don&rsquo;t be fooled. They can have an even blend and quickly turn to your technical competency.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget that while you are choosing the prospect to be a client, they are choosing you as well. You need a quick, well-crafted system to capture a client&rsquo;s personality from the first time they meet with you.</p><p> It&rsquo;s only when a client can get past their fears and share all their financial details, goals and dreams that you can create a financial plan and relationship that your clients will be committed to for life. As an advisor, awareness of these client fears will lead to better, trusting, and long-term relationships with your clients.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 18:08:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 18:08:22.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_O4achOa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-three-hidden-fears-clients-have-of-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"10778\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 18:08:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 18:08:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-three-hidden-fears-clients-have-of-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10777\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5261\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Three-Hidden-Fears-Clients-Have-of-Advisors.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"699\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462338000,"author_id":384,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5063,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"An Insight Into Snapchat's Marketing Capabilities","link":"an-insight-into-snapchats-marketing-capabilities","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Snapchat is a rabble-rouser. People are insanely opinionated about this bold new social player.</p><p> In just a few short years, the channel has accrued more than 100 million daily active users with reports of its monthly active users nearing the 200 million mark. Additionally, Snapchat&rsquo;s video traffic rivals that of Facebook, reaching 8 billion daily views. Snapchat is quickly becoming a massive force and a bona fide millennial fan favorite.</p><p> The problem, however, is that due to Snapchat&rsquo;s limitations on posts, marketers are having an exceptionally difficult time figuring out how to drive discovery, conversions, and other vital business elements through the platform. So ultimately, the question remains: Is Snapchat a marketing winner or loser?</p><p> On March 30th, Mark Fidelman, Fanatics Media CEO, sat down with three of today&rsquo;s most prominent social media experts to delve deep into Snapchat&rsquo;s marketing viability. The Blab conversation featuring Joel Comm, Bryan Kramer, and Jack Kosakowski covered everything from Snapchat&rsquo;s current status for marketers to who can best leverage the platform, features that are missing, and many passionate dialogues singing or dinging Snapchat&rsquo;s features. Watch the full conversation below to see this heated debate in full.</p><p> Joel Comm is one of the world&rsquo;s most recognized authorities on social media. Joel&rsquo;s initial website was one of the first 18,000 websites in the world and his extensive internet business experience spans more than two decades. In that time Joel has developed partnerships, trained, or consulted with massive brands such as Microsoft, Twitter, IBM, and many others. He is a New York Times best-selling author, acclaimed keynote speaker, and all around internet marketing extraordinaire.</p><p> Bryan Kramer is a thought leader in the science of sharing and CEO of PureMatter, as well as the best-selling author of There is No B2B or B2C: It&rsquo;s Human to Human #H2H, which ascended to the #1 top selling Amazon Business Book within its first week of release. Bryan is also an internationally recognized keynote speaker and strategist whose clientele have included the likes of NASA, MasterCard, Dell, and Harvard.</p><p> Jack Kosakowski is a marketing automation, social media, and social sales expert who is known as the &ldquo;SaaSaNova&rdquo; of marketing automation in his networks. He is the Global Head of Social Sales Disruption at the Creation Agency where he works with B2B organizations to incorporate social media tactics into their traditional sales processes to help reduce sales cycles, increase pipelines, and better closing percentages.</p><p> Check out some of the insights these four had to share on Snapchat&rsquo;s marketing capabilities. </p><h3> Question #1: Is Snapchat a Marketing Winner or Loser as It Stands Today?</h3><p> <strong>  Joel: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a winner!&rdquo;</p><p> When any social channel is in its infancy, there are individuals who are willing to take risks and send out messages that have never been seen before. These are the people who are going to get the attention.</p><p> <strong>  Bryan: </strong></p><p> It will eventually be a winner. As of now, it is almost where marketers want it to be but there are some things that need to change before agencies can truly adopt it. There is a lot of stuff there, however, that once it is tweaked will make it successful. From a personal brand standpoint, it is excellent.</p><p> <strong>  Jack: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;If you are trying to reach a millennial audience for B2C, [Snapchat] is amazing.&rdquo;</p><p> For B2B marketing it is a loser. The tools are simply not there. For B2C marketing, that might be different. If you&rsquo;re are trying to reach millennials as your target audience, however, Snapchat is great.</p><p> <strong>  Mark: </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s a loser today for both B2B and B2C marketing. The more tools available to marketers, the more effective they can be for their clients, but they also have to be real about it. Clients spend big money and Snapchat simply doesn&rsquo;t perform as well as other social channels. Mark admitted that he has even reached out to many people who have pushed efforts through Snapchat and none of them have had a positive ROI experience.</p><h3> Question #2: What is the Number One Reason Why Marketers Should Use Snapchat?</h3><p> <strong>  Joel: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;If you connect with the idea of telling stories using the formatting and the tools that Snapchat offers, then it becomes a home for you.&rdquo;</p><p> Nobody &ldquo;should&rdquo; be on any given platform. Whatever platform a person finds most appealing, they are having the most fun using, and where the most people are engaging is where a person should be; this can be any social channel. If you find that you enjoy telling stories with the setup that Snapchat provides, then you should be on there.</p><p> <strong>  Jack: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Use it to your advantage if millennials are your target buyer persona.&rdquo;</p><p> If millennials are the core group of individuals you are targeting, this can be a great resource for newer companies. Many engage with it on a daily basis and that, in turn, will bring loads of interactions.</p><p> <strong>  Brian: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;We have to get to the point where the UI and analytics are better, but when they get those things tight, it&rsquo;s going to be a great tool.&rdquo;</p><p> All social channels have a hard time getting people to understand how to use them when they are growing. After time, people slowly figure it out how to leverage the platform. Snapchat still hasn&rsquo;t figured out who they are and marketers are still trying to figure out how to use it. They will have to get to the point where the UI and analytics are better before it becomes an asset. At that point, millennials will move on to a new platform and marketers will be using Snapchat. Then, this cycle will start all over again.</p><p> <strong>  Mark: </strong></p><p> Snapchat is amazing because of the storytelling. If you want to learn how to tell stories in 10 second increments, Snapchat is the place to experiment. The platform should, however, allow marketers to do the same things discovery tab brands are doing.</p><h3> Question #3: What is Snapchat Missing for Marketers that They Need to Implement?</h3><p> <strong>  Joel: </strong></p><p> Links that can be clicked within snaps. If you send a private snap with a link, the app will open it with an internal browser. If this could be applied to snaps, it will allow for CTAs to be incorporated and used.</p><p> <strong>  Jack: </strong></p><p> When dealing with clients, you have to be able to provide them with hard data on views, clicks, how many people are being nurtured, and you can&rsquo;t do that with Snapchat. It just can&rsquo;t be used until they provide analytics.</p><p> <strong>  Brian: </strong></p><p> The week prior, Brian sat with the CMO of Cisco and several other companies. Each one asked to see and understand Snapchat stating that they know it will be a pivotal part of their strategy moving forward. This is huge considering that it wasn&rsquo;t prompted, but they will all have a hard time learning how to use it.</p><p> <strong>  Mark: </strong></p><p> The problem is that Snapchat makes it impossible to convert and with everything disappearing within 24 hours, there is no discovery. All marketers can do is hope that people will see their content in that time. If Snapchat can get to a point where marketers can convert without ruining the user experience, then it will be useful.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 18:23:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 18:23:22.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_m1ogTN2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/an-insight-into-snapchats-marketing-capabilities/\", \"post_id\": \"10784\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 18:23:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 18:23:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"an-insight-into-snapchats-marketing-capabilities\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10783\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5264\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/An-Insight-Into-Snapchats-Marketing-Capabilities.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1379\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462302000,"author_id":484,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5064,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Busy Entrepreneurs Can Make Time for Blogging","link":"how-busy-entrepreneurs-can-make-time-for-blogging","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether you&rsquo;re a financial advisor, speaker, realtor, freelancer, or Chief Hooligan of your business, you know that blogging is one of those activities that you need to add to your to-do list. Yes, really! (If you&rsquo;re still on the fence, have a  <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  look at these stats </a>   &mdash; scroll down to &ldquo;Blogging Stats&rdquo;).Are you still kicking and screaming because you have no time to blog? It&rsquo;s okay &mdash; there is hope. There are things you can do to speed up the process and make it a little easier to knock out those posts on a regular basis. So, take a deep breath, put your pen to paper &mdash; or fingers to keyboard &mdash; and follow the steps below so you can make time for blogging.</p><h3> How to Come Up With Ideas Quickly</h3>For both new and seasoned bloggers, coming up with new topics can be a challenge. Oftentimes, it can be the longest part of the process when your brain cramps and all your ideas seem to have dried up.If you&rsquo;re new to blogging, you might not be sure where to start, and if you&rsquo;ve been blogging for a while, you might be bored with topics you&rsquo;ve already written about. So, is it surprising when you end up down a rabbit hole called &ldquo;What do I write about?!&rdquo;How can you quickly come up with a topic you think would be helpful to your readers? Fortunately, there are a few ways you can regularly find new topics (and subtopics) to come up with, no matter how long you&rsquo;ve been blogging.<h3> <strong>  1. Ask Your Peeps </strong></h3>Let your clients and potential clients give you the topics. If you&rsquo;re trying to create content that your audience loves, it&rsquo;s that same audience that can give you ideas for new content. When prospects and clients ask you questions, jot them down.Keep your thoughtful answers in a place that you can refer back to because, one day, you can likely turn those conversations into blog posts.Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to name names, but you can share experiences and your answers to demonstrate your expertise and knowledge.[Tweet &ldquo;When trying to create content that your audience loves, that same audience that can give you ideas. &ldquo;]So, fire up Evernote and create a notebook called &ldquo;Blogging Ideas&rdquo; to store any ideas that come to you. Oh, and if you are so inclined, throw in a quick outline. That way, when it&rsquo;s time to begin writing, you won&rsquo;t have to start from scratch.BTW, you really can ask your peeps. Jump on to Twitter or seek the counsel of your LinkedIn groups and Google+ communities. Ask them what&rsquo;s on their minds. What do they want to know more about? What questions have been coming up for them? You might be surprised by the number of responses that you&rsquo;ll get.You could also create a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/87809?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"> Google form</a> with a handful of short questions that they can complete. Share the link in your groups where appropriate and you might find that you have the makings for an entire post &hellip; or at least the beginnings of one.If you have trouble coming up with titles for your posts, check out the <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Hubspot Blog Topic Generator</a> or<a href=\"http://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Portent&rsquo;s Content Idea Generator</a> for a little assistance.<h3> <strong>  2. Set Up Google Alerts </strong></h3><a href=\"http://www.google.com/alerts\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Alerts</a> is a free service that will send you e-mail notifications whenever it finds new results for a topic or keyword you&rsquo;re interested in.Google Alerts can help you:<li> Get a constant stream of ideas. For example, you could get alerted each time specific news stories or topics hit the Internet.</li><li> Look out for breaking industry news. Use Google Alerts to monitor your industry for breaking news you can immediately share with your audience. If you&rsquo;re able to publish breaking news quickly, you might end up getting more traffic to your blog and be seen as a credible source for important, relevant, and timely information.</li><h3> <strong>  3. Look Through Your Pocket (or Evernote) </strong></h3>So, earlier I mentioned that you can throw reader or client questions in Evernote for safekeeping until you&rsquo;re ready for them. Well, as you come across articles and news you&rsquo;re interested in, particularly as they relate to your chosen field, it&rsquo;s also a good idea to put them in <a href=\"http://instapaper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Instapaper</a>, <a href=\"https://getpocket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Pocket</a>, or <a href=\"http://evernote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Evernote</a>.I used to keep specific types of articles in Pocket for a weekly post I wrote in the past. I would throw any article that contained related content about productivity and time management into Pocket and then tag them with a specific keyword so that I could call them up quickly and easily.Then, each week I would sort through the various articles in Pocket, select one, and craft a post around it. Once I used an article, I deleted it from Pocket (short-term storage). But, if I wanted to keep it, I would throw it into Evernote (long-term repository).This is just one way you can use Pocket and Evernote, but certainly think through a process that would work for you. Just be sure that you have a specific spot to keep all the relevant articles you want to refer back to.<h3> <strong>  4. Read &hellip; Then Read Some More </strong></h3>Read often to get blog post ideas!Reading high quality articles and blog posts that other people write can often be inspiring and help you see a variety of perspectives.Use other people&rsquo;s content to help you come up with ideas of your own, or even counter arguments to pieces you read. An app like Zite can help and so can searching specific hashtags on Twitter.<h3> How to Save Time When Blogging</h3>So, maybe you do know what you want to write about. Maybe you have your topic picked out but you&rsquo;re having a hard time stringing coherent thoughts together. Does that mean you shouldn&rsquo;t write? Of course not.&hellip; because there are some strategies you can use to get things going. Some are obvious, like writing when you&rsquo;re feeling alert. For me, a cup of coffee is essential when I&rsquo;m writing in the early morning hours. You might need to exercise first or complete a pre-writing routine to get started.Once you&rsquo;re ready to begin, you might want to &hellip;<h3> <strong>  1. Use a Template </strong></h3>One of the best ways to reduce the time you need to write your posts is to use a template. Anyone who&rsquo;s ever used a canned response knows it&rsquo;s a time saver, especially when you&rsquo;re responding to the same questions frequently.Well, templates work in a similar way. They&rsquo;re not pre-written like canned responses are, but they can help you gather your thoughts and act as guide for you to follow. Templates can help you prepare the main portions of your post, like figuring out your keywords, the main concepts you want to convey, and the supporting data or statistics you plan to share.And, the best part is that you can fill out one section and then come back to it at a later point. The structure of the template will help you to pick up where you leave off.<h3> <strong>  2. Write First, Then &hellip; </strong></h3>Resist the urge to edit while you&rsquo;re writing!&hellip; fill in the rest. You know, things like adding in images and supporting data. Instead, use placeholders (e.g., &ldquo;Insert graphic XYZ here&rdquo;) to remind you where to put quotes, stats, images, charts, etc. so that you can continue with writing.If you start focusing on the other stuff, you&rsquo;ll get off track and probably waste the few precious minutes you have.And, do resist the urge to edit!Editing before you&rsquo;ve finished writing is another sort of never ending rabbit hole. I implore you &mdash; resist it at all costs! The time for editing is not while you&rsquo;re in the process of writing. Revising your post is best reserved for when your post is finished. Otherwise, editing becomes a distraction that makes writing more complicated and time-consuming.So, write first and polish later.<h3> <strong>  3. Use a Timer </strong></h3>Only have five minutes? 15 minutes? No problem! Set a timer for a specific time frame and start writing. Write something. Anything. Just write. Get it out of your head and come back and write some more. You could end up writing for much longer or you could just use the time you have to get some thoughts down or to create an outline.If you have more time, consider using a Pomodoro app, like <a href=\"https://www.focusboosterapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Focus Booster</a>, so you can spend more quality time with your post.

{"original_id":5065,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Need to Talk to Your Older Clients About Long Term Care","link":"why-you-need-to-talk-to-your-older-clients-about-long-term-care","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When you look at an older client&rsquo;s portfolio, the biggest concern is probably about whether they have enough to last to the end. You calculate the drawdown, the earnings, and you spend time on those figures. But what about long term care?This is the conversation the client doesn&rsquo;t want to have. No one wants to think about being disabled or losing independence.Of course, this is not realistic. You, the planner may not want to bring up the subject because of your own discomfort, or because you aren&rsquo;t sure what to say, or perhaps because your client dismisses it if you do bring it up.</p><h3> Consider this realistic typical scenario:</h3>A health crisis happens to your client. It can be a fall, a stroke or heart attack, anything that is unexpected. First, there is a hospitalization.  OK, Medicare covers that, together with supplemental insurance. A rehab facility is next with therapy and nursing care.  Medicare covers that but only to a point. When the elder is ready for discharge, the client and family are told, sometimes a day or two beforehand, that they will have to get help for the aging loved one at home.  &rdquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Medicare cover that?&rdquo; they ask. Unfortunately, no, they are told.<h3> The Cost</h3>So the family members and the client start scrambling to provide help at home. In some parts of the country the cost is about $30 per hour.  According to the Genworth 2015 Cost of Care study, the national median price for someone to provide help with bathing, dressing and walking or other hands-on home help is $20/hour.When you do the math, you realize that even if your client needs just twenty hours a week at the average cost, it will add up to nearly $20,000 a year. That is on top of other, non-covered medical expenses, such as physical therapy when Medicare stops paying, hearing aids, and many medications. And that is just the beginning. Limited hours of home care often stretch into full time care as people who have disabling conditions age.Some people figure they can spend their assets and give things away so they can qualify for Medicaid. I would not recommend Medicaid as the best way to get quality care. First, one must be really destitute to qualify for it. And the state looks back at all financial transactions for a five year period in most states prior to the application to see what was going on. Second, the care one receives is the most basic, may be of the lowest quality and typically is not what anyone really wants.If you can prevent that choice, you will. Your client could spend her last days in a three bed room in a dingy nursing home if she or anyone in her life thinks Medicaid is a fine way to pay for care.The cost for quality care at home can be staggering. In my own prosperous county, with a very high elder population, the cost of 24/7 care at home from non-nursing providers (home care workers) exceeds $200,000 per year. That is on top of the ordinary costs of living a senior has regardless of care.<h3> Taking On The Long Term Care Discussion: Three things you should know</h3><h3> <strong>  1. You need to bring up how to pay for long term care in the future as part of your job of financial planning and retirement planning. </strong></h3>Your client is not likely to ask you about it. Do not wait to have these discussions. Cash for the unexpected need for care could be a major expense. Your client needs to know the facts and figures. Most people grossly underestimate the costs.<h3> <strong>  2. Educate your client about the likelihood of this need for future care.  </strong></h3>About 70% of people will need long term care in some form in their futures. Failure to plan for it can bankrupt a person or leave them in serious debt toward the end of life. Or some investments could make cash inaccessible when needed.<h3> <strong>  3. Use resources to help yourself understand the real costs of home care, assisted living, and nursing home care. In order to educate your client, you need to educate yourself first. </strong></h3>The Genworth Cost of Care study is a good resource.

Why Top CE</p><p> According to new research from CEO.com, reported on the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/the-most-important-digital-skill-for-tomorrows-ceos?utm_content=buffer79bc0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Economic Forum (WEF) website  </a> </u> <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/the-most-important-digital-skill-for-tomorrows-ceos?utm_content=buffer79bc0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a> (the article headline says it all: \"The most important digital skill for tomorrow's CEOs\"), the heads of the world's biggest and most powerful companies are amongst the biggest laggards when it comes to joining the global social media conversation. In fact, a stunning 61% have no social media presence at all! And many of those who do have social accounts rarely have anything to say.</p><p> It seems that for most CEOs, social media is still seen as just a distraction - something that junior staff do when they should be getting on with the 'real work.' But having this mentality means missing a very important trick. In fact I would argue that that it&rsquo;s downright dangerous.</p><p> The fact is that consumers just can't get enough of social media, and it's becoming inexorably bound up in most of our lives. A report from Strategy Analytics shows that more than two billion people throughout the world are now on social media, with users spending an average of two hours per day on these platforms.</p><p> This is having a huge impact on people&rsquo;s browsing and spending habits - millennials now watch more YouTube than TV, and a Market Force study found that fully three-quarters of consumers say social media now influences their buying decisions. So how in the world can CEOs continue to kid themselves that this isn&rsquo;t relevant to the success - and potentially even long-term survival - of their business?</p><p> The biggest barriers to social media for these executives seem to be lack of time, a difficulty in understanding the personal and corporate ROI benefits and a lack of confidence in their ability to master the technical aspects of social media (which no doubt seem ever more daunting, the longer they remain opted out). And we shouldn&rsquo;t under-estimate a fear of looking like a complete idiot - after all, one slip-up on social media can become the stuff of legend (on which note, Happy Ed Balls Day everyone!).</p><p> But when handled carefully and expertly, social media can be one of the best tools under a CEO's belt - helping them to be more productive, promoting themselves and their companies on a global scale, providing insights on what their customers and rivals are up to, and acting as a brilliant PR channel.</p><p> Perhaps most importantly, when a CEO has a social media presence they show the face behind the name, which is crucial to building up trust, loyalty and engagement. People no longer expect CEOs to be mysterious characters locked away at the top of a skyscraper. They want to see who's running the show.</p><p> What's more, when CEOs are active on social media it tends to reverberate throughout the company, breaking down hierarchies and opening up the lines of communication. For me, one of the most telling stats in the WEF report was the finding that 70% of senior professionals says that having a &lsquo;social CEO' makes their company a more attractive place to work. At a time when attracting - and retaining - top talent is higher than ever on corporate agendas, this fact along should be enough to convince any still-wavering CEO.</p><p> And it's not just staff who are influenced positively by having a social CEO, it's the company's overall brand reputation. The CEO.com report says that \"highly regarded companies are more than three times as likely as those with weak reputations to have a CEO who participates in social media.\"</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CEO_sociability_yields_multiple_dividends.png\" width=\"779\"/></p><p> With all these benefits, it's genuinely shocking to me that so many CEOs still remain in social media denial. As the WEF article points out, if even the President of the United States decides it&rsquo;s time to open a Twitter account - as Barack Obama did last year - then what excuse is there for anyone else. (And we're talking about a World Economic Forum article, based on CEO.com research of every single Fortune 500 company here folks, not some throwaway PR puff piece that can be readily dismissed).</p><p> I'll leave the final word on the subject to the CEO.com report: \"Simply put, social media has become a vital tool for CEOs to better communicate and connect with their key stakeholders and enhance the reputations of their companies.\"</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-02 18:48:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-02 18:48:30.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_jD0Zg8S.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-every-ceo-should-be-on-social-media/\", \"post_id\": \"10791\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-02 18:48:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-02 18:48:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-every-ceo-should-be-on-social-media\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10789\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5267\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-Every-CEO-Should-be-on-Social-Media.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"796\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462269600,"author_id":492,"chart_url":""}

One Question You Must Ask Yourself","link":"stuck-on-a-project-feel-stuck-at-life-one-question-you-must-ask-yourself","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Have you ever gotten stuck on a project? Have you ever felt stuck in life? Live long enough and you&rsquo;ll become stuck over and over and over again.</p><p> College students get stuck in their majors or studies. Young adults become confused in their careers. Tenured professionals know better than all the meaning of stuck&mdash;when day-in-and-day-out takes on a meaning you can comprehend only from excessive years of 9-to-5-ing it.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t have the silver-bullet answer, but I have what I think is the ultimate question to ask yourself when you get stuck.</p><h3> The light bulb really must have lit up in his mind&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> First, let&rsquo;s talk about mindset. Thomas Edison once claimed, &ldquo;I never perfected an invention without thinking in terms of how it would benefit others.&rdquo;</p><p> Most people I coach become stuck because inspiration is perishable and their motivation dissolves thanks to boredom, routine, and the lack of meaning they attach to their work.</p><p> The most common (not exclusive) reason this occurs is because they question what they should &ldquo;do with themselves&rdquo; instead of wondering how they can serve others.</p><p> This inside-out approach causes them to center on what to do to make their own lives easier. The true rewards, in all senses of the word, come from thinking in the opposite direction.</p><p> Instead of wondering what you can do, think about what you were meant to do&mdash;to serve others.</p><h3> Drive through the intersection of Purpose Street and Helping Others Avenue&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve interviewed just shy of twelve thousand people in my life. I&rsquo;ve found the happiest (and typically most successful) people have two things in common.</p><p> First, they have undying love for what they do. There is &ldquo;pull power&rdquo; toward a great cause.</p><p> It makes no difference when they struggle along the way because these bumps pale in comparison to their larger, more meaningful goal or purpose. </p><p> Focusing on that significant purpose is what carries you through the tough times. Those stumbles are simply part of the process&mdash;never distractions or endpoints.</p><p> Second, whatever they do contributes&mdash;greatly&mdash;to the benefit of others. Don&rsquo;t dismiss this.</p><p> I recognize many of you work to earn money to feed your kids. This mindset often leads to becoming stuck. Even if you have a family, you can still find a vocation with purpose.</p><p> From another perspective, you might think I just want to be happy and do it for myself. Well, you might be happy for some period as you progress at whatever trade you practice. But, I guaran-damn-tee it, you&rsquo;ll face challenges soon enough that will make you question your desire.</p><p> Your calling to help others is what carries you through. It&rsquo;s what squashes those challenges as you brush them aside as mere annoyances.</p><h3> Are you listening?</h3><p> <br/> Currently, I&rsquo;m working around the clock so I can manage my current business and augment it to benefit many more than I can reach in person.</p><p> If I focused solely on making my life easier, these additional products and services would stink. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p><p> It&rsquo;s so important for me to understand what my community wants; I surveyed them a few weeks ago. I wanted to see what they wanted from me.</p><p> They told me they wanted something other than I planned. Ouch. In a matter of a few days, it was clear I needed to blow up my approach and reframe it to what they said they needed.</p><p> I didn&rsquo;t even contemplate the decision to do this. If I did, it would be a clear indication I was dong what I wanted instead of they needed.</p><p> While this is a personal example, this message stands. When you get stuck, the ultimate question to ask yourself is&hellip;</p><h3> How can I help others by doing what I love to do?</h3><p> <br/> The most important part is not to get discouraged because you don&rsquo;t know exactly how to make it all happen yet. You simply need to take one step at time and gain momentum, then more motivation, then take the next step, and so on. Before you know it, you will have helped many!</p><p> As always, I love to hear from you: What do you do when you get stuck?</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 15:30:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 15:30:47.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_UOayG7Q.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stuck-on-a-project-feel-stuck-at-life-one-question-you-must-ask-yourself/\", \"post_id\": \"10793\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 15:30:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 15:30:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stuck-on-a-project-feel-stuck-at-life-one-question-you-must-ask-yourself\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10792\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5268\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Stuck-on-a-Project-Feel-Stuck-at-Life-One-Question-You-Must-Ask-Yourself.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"903\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462384800,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

You know those sales trainers telling you to &ldquo;Call high up! As high as you can !&rdquo;? Think before you act. Calling the C-suite unprepared can mean an early death sentence for your sales efforts.</p><p> Senior executives are busy. Really busy. I mean, my-schedule-is-booked-three-months-in-advance kind of busy.</p><p> They also live in a world of their own. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not the wall-to-wall carpet, chauffeur-driven, corner-office-with-a-view paradise you might imagine.</p><h3> <strong>  It&rsquo;s way, way tougher than that. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Back when I used to be a divisional Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at a Fortune-50 financial services firm, I got a steady stream of calls that went something like this.</p><p> &ldquo;Hello ? Is this Ago Cluytens ?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Yes. May I ask who is speaking ?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Oh. Hi. It&rsquo;s Mr./Mrs. such-and-such from ACME Corporation. Do you have a minute ?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Possibly. Can I ask what this is about ?&rdquo; <br/> &lt;Insert here&gt; Five minute pitch on their product/service, client list, recent projects ending with (my favorite) the fact that &ldquo;they just happened to be in town next week, and were wondering if I&rsquo;d like to sit down (insert gasp for breath here) ?&rdquo;.</p><p> Guess what didn&rsquo;t happen next ?</p><p> Now compare that with the (unfortunately, minority) of calls I got where the person on the other end of of the line:</p><h3> <strong>  #1. Spoke my language. </strong></h3><p> <br/> They did not talk about &ldquo;using their tried-and-tested methodology to generate shareholder value through optimization of peripheral support processes&rdquo;. Instead, they talked in plain terms about what they offered, why it mattered and why I they thought might be interested.</p><h3> <strong>  #2. Made their point. </strong></h3><p> <br/> There was a reason for their call, and they made clear what it was. Maybe they&rsquo;d just done a piece of research, or they were organizing an invitation-only event or they&rsquo;d been able to resolve an issue I was struggling with for a client.</p><p> Whatever it was, they had a point, and made it. Seconds into the conversation. So they didn&rsquo;t waste my time.</p><h3> <strong>  #3. Demonstrated immediate value. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once they&rsquo;d made their point, they went on to explain why it mattered and asked whether it was relevant to me. If it was (and only if it was), they asked clarifying questions and started *giving me valuable advice and insights that I could use* right then and there.</p><h3> <strong>  #4. Created a conversation. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Soon enough, the call turned into a conversation. Pretty balanced too, with both sides asking questions and offering observations. Trading information and offering peer-to-peer advice.</p><p> Most importantly, two things did not happen. An incoherent, unstructured ramble that left me thinking &ldquo;why is this person calling me ?&rdquo;. Or a structured &ldquo;product pitch&rdquo; including the oh-so important features and benefits statement.</p><h3> <strong>  #5. Gave me an &ldquo;out&rdquo;. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Even after we talked (sometimes at length) about my situation, they said things like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it makes sense, but would you like to schedule some time together to discuss this in more detail ?&rdquo;.</p><p> They never assumed, and certainly did not ask me questions like &ldquo;So would you prefer to sit down on tuesday or thursday of next week ? 9.00 AM or 11.00 ?&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  #6. Closed professionally. </strong></h3><p> <br/> At the end of the conversation, they confirmed the time and date of our next call/meeting and went over the points/items we&rsquo;d discuss. They mentioned what they would send me/do next, and invited me to get in touch if I had questions. And asked me if there was anything else I wanted to discuss.</p><p> And then they thanked me for my time.</p><p> Time? Five minutes, sometimes more. Probability of me sitting down with them ? 9/10 (if I had a need). Amount of selling that went on ? Zero.</p><p> Calling the C-suite is all about being prepared to have a conversation between two professionals of equal stature, giving and exchanging value and determining **together** if it makes sense to take a next step &ndash; and what that could look like.</p><p> Do that, and believe me &ndash; doors will start opening faster than you think.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 15:49:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 15:49:48.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_TlY3tk2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/cold-calling-the-c-suite-6-powerful-rules-to-follow/\", \"post_id\": \"10797\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 15:49:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 15:49:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"cold-calling-the-c-suite-6-powerful-rules-to-follow\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10796\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5270\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cold-Calling-the-C-Suite-6-Powerful-Rules-to-Follow.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"683\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462377600,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}

If your leadership makes your employees feel like they are on a rollercoaster ride, it&rsquo;s time to level things off.</p><p> Your role as a leader is to remove obstacles that prevent employees from doing their jobs; then, get out of their way and let them do the job they were hired to do.</p><p> Here are five characteristics of level-headed leadership. </p><h3> 1. Consistency</h3><p> <br/> A level-headed leader is first, and foremost, consistent. Their leadership and decision making does not rise and fall with their mood. Their treatment of employees does not change based on position in the organization, the team they work with, or personal opinions. Employees know what to expect from level-headed leaders whether it be on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis. This consistency helps employees feel comfortable in their positions and builds trust in their leader.</p><h3> 2. Sees the perspectives of others</h3><p> <br/> A level-headed leader is able to see things from the perspectives of employees, clients, and suppliers. They take a stance of curiosity, taking notice not of their own opinions, but of the thoughts, actions, and motives of others. These leaders explain what needs to be done but then they let their employees determine how it gets done. They are not looking to find fault in others; they use their ability to see situations from different perspectives to help their employees become their own problem solvers.</p><h3> 3. Seeks solutions</h3><p> <br/> Level-headed leadership is not about finding someone to blame; their sole focus is on finding solutions. They use their power of objective observation to provide constructive input and resources that help employees find remedies to issues they encounter. Level-headed leaders rely on employees working throughout the organization to identify issues and propose solutions. These leaders know that the employees who actually perform the tasks are in the best position to advise leaders on actions that need to be taken.</p><h3> 4. Recognizes own weaknesses</h3><p> <br/> Level-headed leaders know that they can&rsquo;t be the best at everything. They recognize where they are weak and where others are strong; they then surround themselves with the right people in the right positions. They delegate tasks that are outside of their own strengths. And, they support their employees in the positions where they are placed in instead of looking for opportunities to criticize and find fault.</p><h3> 5. Understands the importance of teamwork</h3><p> <br/> Level-headed leaders know that no one succeeds on their own; it takes teamwork. When team members work together in a consistent and inspiring environment, the results they achieve exceed the total results possible from individual contributions. Effective teams work together to solve problems rather than pointing fingers and assigning blame. These leaders set the example and lay the foundation for the development of strong, collaborative teams.</p><h3> Level-Headed Leadership <br/>  </h3><p> A level-headed leader is consistent. They can see things from the perspectives of others. They seek solutions rather than looking to place blame. They recognize their own weaknesses. And, they understand the importance of teamwork. The job of a leader is to provide resources, place employees in the right roles, and remove obstacles to productivity. Then, a level-headed leader gets out of the way and lets employees do their work, their way.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 16:24:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 16:24:28.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_BWmO5Ki.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-possess-any-of-these-5-level-headed-leadership-characteristics/\", \"post_id\": \"10798\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 16:24:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 16:24:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-possess-any-of-these-5-level-headed-leadership-characteristics\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10796\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5271\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cold-Calling-the-C-Suite-6-Powerful-Rules-to-Follow.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1380\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462381200,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5071,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"11 Financial Lessons to My Younger Self","link":"11-financial-lessons-to-my-younger-self","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Sitting in the front row were two athletic soon-to-be college graduates, eager for corporate, game face and all. A serious and focused young woman in her 20s, adjacently positioned, never stopped making eye contact with me or taking notes in the Giovatto Auditorium.</p><p> This was an event hosted by the Business Leaders of Tomorrow at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, NJ. An active and engaged group of student leaders ready to take on the world, representing the next wave of millennial entrepreneurs, global business and finance professionals, and tech superstars defining the evolution of a connected economy.</p><p> Judging by the lay of the land, putting the cell phone away was clearly a battle I would not win during my presentation. As a matter of fact, I didn&rsquo;t even try.</p><p> &ldquo;How many of you remembered to bring your cell phone to class?&rdquo; I asked rhetorically and saw all hands shoot up. &ldquo;Excellent, let&rsquo;s get started then!&rdquo;</p><p> I fired up my PowerPoint, which was preloaded with text message (SMS) polls, an audience response system that uses mobile technology to display answers in real-time. It works like this:</p><li> I ask questions</li><li> The student&rsquo;s text answers</li><li> Real-time results are displayed on the big screen in front of the room <br/>  </li><p> The next thing I knew everybody was on their phone. Text questions from students, verbal ones too, were continuously populating the screen! The one I liked the most, &ldquo;What financial lessons would you teach your younger self?&rdquo; Taking a moment to pause I said, &ldquo;Saving for retirement and negotiating for starters. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, we&rsquo;ll write about it!&rdquo;</p><h3> And so we dedicate this blog post to the aspiring young scholar in the room who had the courage to ask her question&mdash;aloud. <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1. Save for retirement in your 20&rsquo;s. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The earlier you start saving for retirement the better, thanks to the magic of compound interest, interest that is paid both on the original amount of money and on the interest it generates. Albert Einstein, the genius behind the world&rsquo;s most famous scientific equation E = mc2 called compound interest &ldquo;the strongest force in the universe.&rdquo; Bottom line, the timing of your investment is more important than the actual amount so do it in your 20s, when it has more time to compound. For example, $1,000 earning 10% yields $100 in interest. The next period, you add that to the principle ($1,000 + $100) and get $1,100, which now earns $110 in interest, and so on.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Learn about investing early. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The best way to learn about money, stocks and bonds, and investments overall is to own them. Nowadays, beginners can even use a stock simulator to get their feet wet in a virtual environment before risking their own capital (yes, all investments carry risk). Many of these online simulators, such as  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Investopedia&rsquo;s Beginners Only Game </a> , are free to use and include tutorials that can help build confidence and knowledge, introduce concepts like trading and short selling, and explain various fundamental and technical analysis. Having first-hand experience will position you for future success as a knowledgeable and well-informed investor.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Drive the clunker longer. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Resisting the temptation to trade in the clunker is cheaper and better in the long run. Think about how much faster you can pay down your debt without having to pay a monthly car loan or lease payment, usually three to four years on average. Life without a car payment can also do wonders for the rest of your college expenses, not to mention your emergency fund, retirement account, or investment account. Another option is to build up enough savings for a larger down payment, which means having to finance less money, and a lower monthly loan or lease payment.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Only work for companies that offer a 401(k) company match. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Some employers match part or contribute a certain amount to your retirement savings based on the amount you contribute. An employer match is the equivalent of free money, compounding annually, potentially adding thousands towards your retirement plan contributions. A typical match is 50% of employee contributions for the first 6% of salary. These funds also grow tax-free until they are withdrawn, beginning at age 59 &frac12; without penalty. With full retirement age escalating higher to age 67 for those born 1960 or later, starting a 401(k) early in one&rsquo;s career is key later in life.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Pay attention to ATM fees. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Automated teller machines are notorious for charging hefty fees on consumers who use ATMs to withdraw cash. According to Bankrate.com, the fees for using a bank&rsquo;s ATM when you&rsquo;re not a checking account holder at that bank jumped 4% to $2.88 per transaction last year alone. To make matters even worse, additional fees called surcharges, are also imposed on consumers who use ATMs by other banks outside their network. A recent  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/atm-fees-rise-toward-5-per-withdrawal-1443981841\" target=\"_blank\">  Wall Street Journal survey </a>  finds an average cost of $4.52 for out-of-network withdrawals. Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you - ATM plus surcharge fees can quickly escalate to hundreds of dollars if you&rsquo;re not careful!</p><h3> <strong>  6. Start a 529 college savings plan. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The cost for education is at an all-time high, with no relief in sight. Starting the accumulation phase early means more money will be available at the start of the first tuition bill. But the decisions of where to save and how to save can work in your favor using a tax-advantaged savings plan known as a 529 Plan. Nearly every state offers at least one type of 529 plan: a saving programs or a prepaid program&mdash;you can invest in a 529 plan from another state different from where you live. The main tax benefit has to do with earnings (not contributions) which grow federal tax-free. They will not be taxed when the money is used to pay for &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; educational expenses such as tuition and fees, books, supplies and equipment. Also, 529 plans allow for change in ownership and can be easily transferred to a sibling, parent, or another member of the family.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Purchase term insurance over whole insurance. </strong></h3><p> <br/> For most young people and growing families, term insurance is a far better and less expensive option than whole life, especially when cost is a main issue or coverage is needed for a specified period of time. Term insurance provides immediate but temporary coverage for a lower premium compared to whole life. While whole life policies build cash value, assuming premiums are paid and certain conditions met, they are more expensive. In my case, I would have been better off purchasing term insurance and putting those extra dollars to work in a retirement account such as an IRA or Roth IRA.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Obsess over credit score and APR. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your credit score is the first line of defense when it comes to securing a personal loan for an automobile, apartment, or the purchase of a home. The better your credit score, the lower the interest rate. Conventional mortgage loans usually require a FICO credit score of at least 740 to get the lowest mortgage rates and fees. With that said, the younger you start to monitor and raise your credit score the cheaper the costs to borrow. How do you maintain a high credit score? Paying credit cards off in full each month while avoiding cards with high interest rates, such as retail credit cards which carry excessive APRs (annual percentage rates), 23.23 percent on average according to  <a href=\"http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/retail-store-card-survey-data-chart-2014.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  survey data from CreditCards.com </a> .</p><h3> <strong>  9. Learn the Rule of 72.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a very easy mental math shortcut to figure out how long it takes an investment to double in value I wish I knew about back when. This shortcut is called the Rule of 72. It&rsquo;s a useful skill to have when you&rsquo;re young because it can put things in perspective. The rule says in order for you to find the number of years required to double your money, divide that interest rate into 72. For example, if you want to know how long it will take you to double your money at six percent interest, divide 6 into 72 and get 12 years. The Rule of 72 can also be flipped around! If you want to double your money in 6 years, divide 72 by 6 and you will need to earn 12%. </p><h3> <strong>  10. Negotiate everything, including more money. </strong></h3><p> <br/> My younger self didn&rsquo;t give much thought to negotiating, only finding a job. Today&rsquo;s graduates find themselves in a similar circumstance, lucky to land a job right out of college and earning a regular salary. Sixty percent of today&rsquo;s millennials don&rsquo;t negotiate salary when receiving their first job offers either, according to  <a href=\"http://www.payscale.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  payscale. </a> <a href=\"http://payscale.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  com </a> . So the million dollar question, &ldquo;should I take the leap and try to negotiate or play it safe and keep quiet?&rdquo; It depends. If you don&rsquo;t ask you don&rsquo;t get. So if you&rsquo;re ok with that, then proceed. However, I can tell you from personal experience, that negotiation is a skill necessary if you wish to elevate your status to that of a top performer, in fact it&rsquo;s expected. Employers will be looking for you to be able to articulate the value you bring to their organization and spell out &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I am going to do&rdquo; before they entertain any salary adjustment. Consider other rewards such as a better title, tuition reimbursement, flex and vacation time &ndash; all which have a positive net effect on your future.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11-lessons-to-my-younger-self.png\" width=\"655\"/></p><h3> <strong>  11. Ask deeper and more questions. </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is an old Chinese proverb that goes like this, &ldquo;He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever.&rdquo; It is a powerful reminder of the importance of asking questions, especially for college graduates hoping to master an area of study and ultimately make that grand leap of faith from academics to the real world. Remember back in grade school when you learned the Pythagorean Theorem for the very first time? Most of us just didn&rsquo;t get it. In spite of the potential embarrassment we raised our hands, asked questions, went for extra help, and even earned a high grade.  Let's not forget that asking deeper and more questions is fundamental to growth; it is a sign of strength, not weakness. Just ask the students of BLT. </p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 17:13:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 17:13:48.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_mHEkbgJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/11-financial-lessons-to-my-younger-self/\", \"post_id\": \"10801\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 17:13:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 17:13:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"11-financial-lessons-to-my-younger-self\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10799\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5272\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11-Financial-Lessons-to-My-Younger-Self.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"811\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462375800,"author_id":485,"chart_url":""}

There have been endless articles about the music legend, ranging from his love of religion to how his eccentricities made him a global music phenomenon.</p><p> As a kid growing up in the 1980s, I was a Prince fan. He was such an odd character, and his music was so different, that it is hard not to feel a sense of loss from his passing.</p><h3> But that&rsquo;s the fan perspective.</h3><p> <br/> From the estate planning perspective, things are about to get very interesting. Prince&rsquo;s younger sister, Tyka Nelson, said in a court filing on Tuesday (April 26, 2016), that Prince died without a  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Will </a> . Ms. Nelson asked the court to appoint the St. Paul-based Bremer Bank temporary authorization over Prince&rsquo;s affairs, calling the situation &ldquo;an emergency.&rdquo;</p><p> I personally have a hard time believing that Prince died without some Will or  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Trust </a> . Prince was known to be a savvy businessperson, and the thought of his leaving his  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  estate </a>  to the whims of Minnesota  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intestate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  intestate </a>  law are unthinkable.</p><p> In 2015, Prince&rsquo;s estate made $55 million. He owned properties in Minnesota estimated to be worth $27 million. Moreover, Prince has a massive collection of songs that he never released. Most estimates have Prince&rsquo;s estate valued over $100 million, but those are early estimates. It could be worth MUCH more.</p><h3> Who is going to handle all of this? Who is going to sift through all of Prince&rsquo;s unreleased songs and decide which ones to release?</h3><p> <br/> Who is going to manage the royalties from his current songs on the radio? Who is going to manage the upkeep of his properties? How could he not have planned for this eventuality?</p><p> Under Minnesota intestate law (i.e., the default estate laws for Minnesota when there is no Will), all of Prince&rsquo;s assets would be divided between his sister and his half-siblings, assuming he was not married and had no children. That&rsquo;s a huge windfall for people who might not be used to vast sums of wealth, and a situation that is ripe for conflicts and lawsuits. I&rsquo;ve seen people fight over $50,000 as much as they do over $500 million. And they will fight, assuming there was no plan in place for them. Prince should have created trusts for his family to protect them from themselves.</p><p> This same principle holds true for those who live in New Jersey and New York. Start asking yourself: do you have up-to-date estate documents? What will happen to your assets when you&rsquo;re gone? What will happen to your intellectual property after you&rsquo;re gone? Will your children inherit a windfall because you have no trusts in place to protect them from themselves?</p><p> Prince died at 57. He was young. I can&rsquo;t believe he didn&rsquo;t have a Will or Trust. But if the rumors and court papers are true, we could be in for a long fight ahead. Stay tuned.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 17:21:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 17:21:21.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_yzWcmMm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/princes-will-if-the-rumors-and-court-papers-are-true-there-could-be-a-long-fight-ahead/\", \"post_id\": \"10803\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 17:21:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 17:21:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"princes-will-if-the-rumors-and-court-papers-are-true-there-could-be-a-long-fight-ahead\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10802\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5273\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Princes-Will-If-the-Rumors-and-Court-Papers-Are-True-There-Could-Be-a-Long-Fight-Ahead.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"532\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462370400,"author_id":11,"chart_url":""}

But these women are also in a kind of club you probably don&rsquo;t want to join: Their marriages  <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/11/15/celebrity-affairs-nannies-gavin-rossdale-gwen-stefani-photos/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  made headlines </a>  when their husbands reportedly cheated on them with the nannies who cared for their children.</p><p> Of course, this unenviable situation is not confined to celebrity circles. Plenty of &ldquo;real life&rdquo; marriages fall victim to  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/fashion/the-nanny-factor-in-hollywood-marriages.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">  the nanny factor </a>  as well. A nanny is an ideal child-care solution for many couples looking to balance domestic and professional demands. For those with high-profile careers requiring long hours and frequent travel on short notice, hiring a nanny to live with the family can be the best, most stable option. When a live-in nanny is cheerful and accommodating, great with the children and a comfortable fit in the household, she can quickly come to seem like a treasured part of the family. It&rsquo;s a situation that can work out beautifully for everyone. But, unfortunately, it can also turn sour.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve had more than one client who considered the nanny an absolute godsend&hellip; until the day that nanny&rsquo;s affair with her husband came to light. At that point, as these clients can tell you, gratitude takes a sharp turn toward deep humiliation and eventually, fury.</p><p> Sometimes in these situations, the nanny gets fired and everybody moves on. Other times, the affair proves to be the last straw in a stressed and failing marriage, and divorce attorneys are contacted.</p><h3> If you are in this situation, what can you do?</h3><p> <br/> Maintain your preparedness, even in the happiest of times.</p><p> No matter what the reasons for your divorce, the best way to get through it in strong financial shape is to be prepared. Now, of course there&rsquo;s no way to prepare for the shock of discovering your husband in a tryst with your trusted nanny. However, if you&rsquo;re a financially savvy spouse, you have been preparing to get through divorce successfully&mdash;even if that was preparation you thought you might never need.</p><p> What does  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/07/23/perspective-and-preparedness-for-divorcing-women/#337956d348c7\" target=\"_blank\">  preparedness </a>  mean, exactly? Why do I recommend that you prepare for divorce, if you&rsquo;re not planning to divorce?</p><p> To my mind, being financially prepared for divorce means that you are very familiar, in a hands-on way, with all aspects of your marital finances. You can list your assets and liabilities, and you have a good working knowledge of your income and expenses. You are  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/03/06/financial-literacy-the-key-to-every-womans-financial-stability/#399b815338d4\" target=\"_blank\">  financially literate </a> .</p><p> Ideally, you will also have a properly executed  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/07/17/skittish-about-a-prenup-like-it-or-not-you-already-have-one/#1e6071d312e0\" target=\"_blank\">  prenuptial agreement </a>  in place, setting forth your and your husband&rsquo;s wishes about what would be considered your separate property in the event of a divorce. You will also have maintained credit in your name alone, and have sufficient funds available to hire an excellent  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=275\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  professional divorce team </a> .</p><h3> Get your emotions in control.</h3><p> <br/> Ending your marriage after discovering your husband has had an affair with the young woman you trusted with your children gives rise to very different emotions than divorcing after years of undefined &ldquo;drifting apart.&rdquo; The betrayal and anger will be intense, to put it mildly. You&rsquo;ll need to deal with those feelings, and all the others that accompany the emotional roller coaster that divorce brings with it. As soon as possible, you should find yourself a  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/05/01/expert-advice-for-divorcing-women-coping-emotionally-while-youre-thinking-financially/#1e60f55c6d04\" target=\"_blank\">  compassionate therapist </a>  to help you cope.</p><p> That&rsquo;s critically important, because when it comes to the legal and financial considerations at the heart of the divorce process, you must do everything you can to  <a href=\"http://thinkfinancially.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Think Financially, Not Emotionally&reg; </a> . You may have heard the old saying, &ldquo;Marriage is about love, but divorce is all about money&rdquo; &hellip; and it&rsquo;s true. The nuts and bolts of your divorce will concern the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2011/04/12/understanding-how-assets-get-divided-in-divorce/#67c4871a3712\" target=\"_blank\">  division of assets </a>  and liabilities. For this complex task, you want your thinking to be absolutely as clear as possible. Making financial decisions out of spite, anger, or sadness can lead to deep regret or even disaster.</p><p> With your financial know-how in good shape and your emotions properly handled, you are best positioned to navigate the divorce process and emerge in the best possible financial situation.</p><p> Hiring a nanny can be an excellent way to be sure your children are well cared for when you and your husband need to focus on your jobs. The continuity, convenience, and trust can be invaluable. The relationship is most effective when all parties keep in mind, always, that it is a professional one. If your nanny and/or your husband have trouble upholding that standard, it&rsquo;s absolutely time to re-evaluate.</p><p> ###</p><p> <strong>  Reminder: </strong>  The nanny works for you, not the other way around. You do not have to tolerate inappropriate behavior from her toward your husband (even if he doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind it), and she doesn&rsquo;t have to tolerate it from him. She may be a great fit for your kids, but remember that there are other excellent candidates out there. If the nanny conducts herself unprofessionally, replace her. If your husband conducts himself unprofessionally&hellip; well, at the very least, you have some serious talking to do.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip:  </strong> If you don&rsquo;t have a prenuptial agreement, then a postnuptial agreement is the next best thing. To draw one up, you and your husband should have separate legal representation. I strongly recommend you consult with a family law attorney who specializes in helping divorcing women.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters:  </strong> Check with your attorney to see if your husband&rsquo;s affair could influence the terms of your divorce. If you live in a state that still allows adultery to be considered as a factor in determining alimony or the division of assets, it could be worth making the affair an issue (if you can prove it). However, that can get ugly, and very expensive, very quickly, so make sure it would be worth it. Divorcing without assigning &ldquo;fault&rdquo; to one spouse is usually preferable. That said, if the affair was conducted in a way that affected your children, or exposed them to inappropriate people or situations, that could definitely impact any custody agreement you might negotiate.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 17:26:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 17:26:12.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Zu0Rc8X.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/too-good-to-be-true-when-the-nanny-becomes-a-problem-for-your-marriage/\", \"post_id\": \"10805\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 17:26:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 17:26:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"too-good-to-be-true-when-the-nanny-becomes-a-problem-for-your-marriage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10804\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5274\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Too-Good-To-Be-True-When-The-Nanny-Becomes-A-Problem-For-Your-Marriage.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1710\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462374000,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5074,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why the Psychological Contract in Business Is Key","link":"why-the-psychological-contract-in-business-is-key","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The technology driven changes in work environment and social translucence will implicate contractual relations, causing a upheaval in the concept of doing business and maintaining partnerships. Co-creation is key.</p><p> The advantages of co-creation will only evolve out of perceived loyalty, because this will lead to engagement and an increase of productivity. More and more effective leadership will be defined by the degree of compassion, trust, respect, fairness, empathy and objectivity that organisations radiate. Whether it involves employees, partnerships or suppliers, the psychological contract is an important building block within any ecosystem.</p><p> We&rsquo;re all familiar with ecosystems in the natural world: organisms interacting with each other and their particular environment consisting out of air, water, mineral soil, and/or other relevant elements. This doesn&rsquo;t differ so much from the atmosphere of businesses in current society. </p><p> Businesses need to join or create ecosystems. In the early phase of this new digital age it seemed to be about business ecosystems, but now it becomes clearer every day that a successful business doesn&rsquo;t evolve around the business but around the story behind the business.</p><p> In other words, about the brand. Recently I shared my vision on contract management as a strategy and why brand ecosystems are best build on the foundation of the forces of nature: the psychological contract.</p><h3> <strong>  Why the psychological contract is key </strong></h3><p> <br/> The Psychological Contract Theory was originally developed by Denise Rousseau, in order for one to better specify how employers and employees understand the employment relationship. Informal arrangements, mutual beliefs, common ground and perceptions between two parties define the way people interact and collaborate. In most organisations the psychological contract is yet to be fully defined and understood. It&rsquo;s far from widespread recognised, let alone used in organisations, although it&rsquo;s a crucial basis for developing shared understandings. Thus it sets the dynamics for relationships and defines the practicality of the work to be done in brand ecosystems</p><p> Every brand is built by a community of fans and ambassadors. The people inside the company are &ndash; as ambassadors &ndash; an important part of that community. But partners, suppliers, investors, customers,  potential customers, and even competitors are equally valuable. Everyone has their own role to play in an ecosystem. Eventually they will be repaid for their efforts in taking responsibility for the role that was casted for them. How does this relate to the psychological contract?  It particularly relates to the &lsquo;solidarity effect&rsquo; on contractual relations.</p><h3> <strong>  Growth through nurturing joint goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> The agreements in writing are clear and often leading, while the non-written arrangements are much more powerful in relationships. The way we interact with each other, we collaborate and co-create is paving the infrastructure of the ecosystem. The aim to achieve something that lies beyond the effective scope and capabilities of any individual actor or several similar actors is the reason parties join an ecosystem. It&rsquo;s the only way they can distinguish themselves to reach a set goal. Take for instance The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). A non-profit organisation that has set an example of global partnering with an extremely wide reach. They strive to ensure safety for consumers, while protecting the reputation of the food industry. Members include many of the world&rsquo;s largest food producers and distributors. No organisation could have ever realised the set goals on such scale individually. Therefore people need to embrace the power of co-creation, doing stuff together. In order to do that, one has to understand what the influence is of psychological contract. What is the desired behaviour and what moral values endorse that behaviour?</p><p> The obligations that result from a psychological contract are subject to the perceptions of the involved parties. Compassion, trust, respect, fairness, empathy and objectivity. The holy ingredients of a fertile psychological contract. Also characteristics of good leadership. Leaders need to create a culture of openness, teamwork, collaboration, sharing of relevant and reliable facts. Not only internally &ndash; with employees -, but with every party within the ecosystem. Manage expectations and involve the right people at the right time, holding everyone accountable for their part in the journey. People want to feel respected, involved, heard, well-led and valued. This is not to be underestimated. Integrity, mutual trust and recognition are crucial for maintaining healthy relationship between organisations as well as between people individually. Especially when dealing with change. People fear change.</p><h3> <strong>  Engagement strengthens collaboration </strong></h3><p> <br/> The way we define and manage the psychological contract, and how we apply its underpinning principles and values in our relationships defines our humanity. It&rsquo;s all about building engagement. As I stated in my previous publication on this subject, the psychological contract develops and evolves constantly based on (the lack of) communication and the unwritten expectations of the relationship as distinct from the formal contract. Social connectivity and technological empowerment pose a huge opportunity, as it is enabling scalability and transparency and facilitating intensive interaction in a collaboration.

{"original_id":5075,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"\"Money Is a Key Factor in All Our Lives\"","link":"money-is-a-key-factor-in-all-our-lives","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Bestselling business book author and behavioral expert Beverly Flaxington talks with  <u>  <a href=\"http://opportunistmagazine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Opportunist&rsquo;s  </a> </u> Managing Editor Leslie Stone about her guidebook for financial advisors, why she feels passionate about helping others and what she thinks about the current race for the White House.</p><p> The role of a financial advisor has changed tremendously since the Great Recession. &ldquo;We have gone from being a very product-oriented, product-pushing industry, if you will, to having to really look at the person on the other side of the money,&rdquo; says Beverly Flaxington, founder of the Boston area-based  <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Collaborative </a> . &ldquo;Money is a key factor in all our lives; the only thing closer to us would be our health and our family. As an industry, we love our jargon and the mystique but we have to get away from that. Regulations are such that you&rsquo;ve got to know your client and your client has to know why a particular investment is good for them. We have to interact much more human-to-human with people now, helping them understand what we are doing and why, and then make recommendations based not on commissions but what&rsquo;s right for this person.&rdquo;</p><p> In a marketplace rife with regulations, education is critical, Flaxington says. &ldquo;There is always the danger of somebody telling you that what you did yesterday is no longer OK today. In a lot of cases, it&rsquo;s not as clear-cut as you may think. Three different compliance people may view the same issue differently. There is no black and white; there&rsquo;s a lot of gray. The key for people in any business is finding out how to apply these regulations and do their best work.&rdquo;</p><p> Flaxington aims to help financial advisors do just that. Her latest book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Guide-Sales-Financial-Advisors/dp/0983762082/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Pocket Guide to Sales for Financial Advisors  </a> </u> , gives tips on how professionals can succeed in today&rsquo;s environment. &ldquo;If you want to grow your business, the bottom line is that you&mdash;or someone on your team&mdash;needs to sell, and to sell well,&rdquo; she says. She is also an adjunct professor at Suffolk University, as well as a Gold-award winning author, international speaker, accomplished consultant, hypnotherapist, personal and career coach, corporate trainer, facilitator and business development expert.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist: What was the inspiration for   <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Guide-Sales-Financial-Advisors/dp/0983762082/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Pocket Guide to Sales for Financial Advisors  </a>  ? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington: </strong>  I have never been a financial advisor myself, but I held corporate jobs in the financial industry and worked for a financial advisory firm in a senior role. My inspiration came from my work with advisors who, quite often, loathe having to identify themselves as being in sales. Sales is looked at as very negative because they believe they&rsquo;re doing the right thing by their client&mdash;with their client&rsquo;s money&mdash;and to put a sales angle on it, so to speak, is very negative to many of them. And yet if we are proud of the work we do, we have to be able to quote-unquote &lsquo;sell it&rsquo; to someone else so they know. I have developed all different tools and approaches and ways of doing this over the years and I thought it would be helpful for advisors who perhaps cannot afford to hire us. The book gives specific tips and ideas and helps them to see that they, too, can become very effective at selling without being an overly salesy person. It really is all about your own brand and how you present yourself so that someone says, &lsquo;I need you!&rsquo;</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist: Can you tell us a little about   <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Collaborative  </a>   and your role there? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington: </strong>  Simply put, we do consulting. We listen to what our clients&rsquo; issues are and help them figure out a way to fix it and achieve their goals. We assist them with team building and making good hires and, from a coaching perspective, we implement ongoing training practices and one-on-one coaching with people of all levels of an organization to help them improve in their role. All of the tools and techniques we use are actually proprietary to us. We develop our own methods and approaches and have trademarked quite a few of them, but I am really proud of the fact that we bring not only ideas but our own experience developed over time to help people get where they want to go.</p><p> Financial services is my personal background and about 90 percent of the firms we work with are in the financial services business and include large platform providers, custodians and asset managers and investment firms serving those advisors, as well as wholesalers and people who sell to advisors. As the primary person on the business development side for our firm, I have established lots of strong relationships and a strong following, fortunately, of repeat clients and referrals. A handful of clients referred to us are outside of this business. I&rsquo;m very passionate about the work that I do, and enjoy being involved hands-on with clients. I am also the &lsquo;thinker&rsquo; about what else we should and can be doing or offering, and I stay very involved with growing our business and day-to-day operations. I have an incredible team that allows me to focus on all those things.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist: It seems you&rsquo;ve successfully melded both the art and the science to it all. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington:  </strong> Yes, we have been very successful at bringing those two pieces together&mdash;the technical as well as the human behavior aspect&mdash;and I think we do a nice job of incorporating both of those.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist: We understand you have written seven books on personal and professional development. What made you decide to focus on this genre? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington: </strong>  The impetus was that, as a college professor, I was asked to teach a graduate course called Dealing With Difficult People. Sometimes you&rsquo;re provided a book and an outline for your lectures, and at other times you&rsquo;re told to go ahead and make it up as you go along. I didn&rsquo;t have a guide for this course, but the graduate students I taught were out in the world dealing with different personalities. At the end of the course, my students came up to me and said everyone should be required to learn this. I then wrote my book  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Other-People-Secrets-Behavior/dp/0615272290/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Understanding Other People: The Five Secrets to Human Behavior </a> , which became an international bestseller. I won the Gold award for it. It&rsquo;s still fairly popular and a couple of colleges use it in their courses. I got really excited about books becoming a medium for me to deliver my ideas to people, so they can learn what I am able to do and do it for themselves.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist: In a recent article for Psychology Today, you address how conflict instigators are &lsquo;blamers&rsquo; who &lsquo;attract, welcome and thrive in the conflict environment.&rsquo; </strong> The current presidential campaign certainly seems to be built upon conflict and negativity. How does this M.O. serve (or hurt) the candidates?</p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington:  </strong> Many people today feel frustrated, feel they&rsquo;ve lost control over things and that there&rsquo;s a lot going on that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Taking a conflict-rife position ignites and triggers that innermost part of people that makes them think, heck yeah, we&rsquo;re fed up and we aren&rsquo;t going to take it anymore. The vitriol not only attracts this groundswell of people who react but also serves the candidates well. The ugly underbelly to that is that it&rsquo;s so divisive. You start to look at friends, family members and colleagues as either &lsquo;you&rsquo;re in my camp or you&rsquo;re not.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re ceasing to look for solutions that involve people coming together to solve these issues that have triggered something in all of us. We are all seeing this, and yet we are losing that common connection in favor of &lsquo;us versus them&rsquo; thinking. From a political perspective, this approach actually works to draw followers. From the perspective of what it will do to our country, I think it&rsquo;s potentially quite disastrous.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist:  How can we as a nation overcome this divisiveness? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington: </strong>  The interesting thing about this&mdash;and I live in Massachusetts, traditionally a Democratic state&mdash;is that there is a huge swath of the population who would define themselves as independent. Why have they been forced to choose between a socially conscious persona and also being fiscally responsible? I do believe there&rsquo;s a large mass of people, myself included, who aren&rsquo;t comfortable with one clear side or the other. Many have beliefs that draw from both sides. I don&rsquo;t mean to be Pollyanna, but I think each of us has to look at ways we are feeding into this divisiveness by either judging someone for something or putting them in a category or labeling them a certain way based on something we hear them say. This is, in a way, what these candidates are encouraging us to do. I think we have to stand up and say there&rsquo;s not an upside to the divisiveness. It&rsquo;s not going to help any of us.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist: What are your thoughts on the Kasich-Cruz alliance? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington:  </strong> I have been squarely in the middle&mdash;almost apolitical&mdash;and I think the behavior we are seeing on both sides of the campaign is quite disastrous. We have real problems we need to solve. Mudslinging has been popular dating back to our founding fathers, but it has reached a point where you wonder if anybody knows what the issues are. Can they even state those clearly? Can they define what our biggest obstacles are? My concern is that we are setting a standard that makes it advantageous to attack your opponents. I would liken it to when, as a consultant, I go into a business and somebody tells me all the company&rsquo;s problems are due to one individual and if that person gets out of the way all will be well. There are always other issues and attacking just one person is not going to solve them. Cruz, Kasich and Hillary are all party to this attack mode.</p><p> Meanwhile, there are real problems to be solved. Voters need to know how the candidates are going to rally people because nobody can sit in office alone and fix this. What&rsquo;s their plan to rally people from both sides and make something happen? I guess I&rsquo;m looking for somebody with a plan.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist: What about Senator Bernie Sanders and his economic &lsquo;Agenda for America,&rsquo; a plan that he believes will move the country forward? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington: </strong>  I do think Bernie Sanders has some admirable goals, but here&rsquo;s where my business mind kicks in. I would like to be able to see how we get there without becoming a very different nation than we have been since our founding. I don&rsquo;t have a clear picture.</p><p> In the Leadership and Social Responsibility class that I teach, my students are asked to solve a problem. I tell them, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bring me ideas&mdash;everyone has an idea&mdash;I want to see the plan.&rsquo; I need to know who&rsquo;s doing it and how, what it&rsquo;s going to cost and what the steps are. Without a plan, it&rsquo;s still an idea. Who on the current platform can really show us a who, how, what and how much so we can understand what it&rsquo;s really going to take?</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist:  It has been more than 50 years since JFK signed the Equal Pay Act into law and yet women in the United States still make about 79 cents to a man&rsquo;s dollar </strong> &mdash;even less in states with a wider gender wage gap. What advice would you give women&mdash;female financial advisors particularly&mdash;on how to overcome this disparity?</p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington:  </strong> I recently spoke at a women&rsquo;s international event, and I did lots of research beforehand on the percentage of women at executive levels. The results were pretty startling. Women in the financial industry hold close to 60 percent of the jobs, but in the executive suite the number dropped to about 5 percent. At the time the study was done, there was not even one CEO of any nature in any financial institution. My research found also, from a manager perspective, that women get higher marks as overall managers, and even as sales managers. One thing the men in our industry need to recognize is that it&rsquo;s beneficial to put more women in serious roles. Women, perhaps naturally, work well with couples, with families and multigenerational clients&mdash;and with about half the wealth being held by women that relational opportunity is there.</p><p> Women are not taught to sell their brand or do any form of self-promotion. There is research on that as well, and I think that is why we get held back in the sense that we struggle to really define our value and say we are worth what we are worth. Female financial advisors with great skills need to couple that with getting their brand out there and communicating why they are of value.</p><p> <strong>  Opportunist:  Can readers look forward to any upcoming book projects? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Beverly Flaxington: </strong>  I have been working on a more generic version of The Pocket Guide to Sales for Financial Advisors for people who need to become more influential in their careers. The other big thing we have been doing is creating an online platform called  <a href=\"http://advisorssalesacademy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Advisor&rsquo;s Sales Academy </a> , which basically takes the work I&rsquo;ve done over the years and makes it available online so it&rsquo;s less expensive and more accessible to a greater mass of people. I really want to get as much information into as many hands as possible because I believe people are capable of doing a lot more but haven&rsquo;t been given the tools and information.</p><p> I have also been toying with the idea of writing an inspirational book for women on how you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to choose. You can have a lot of different aspects to who you are and celebrate that. People are always waiting for this or that to get on with life, but I don&rsquo;t think we have to wait. Opportunities abound. In fact, my title might be Why Wait? When I shared my own corporate journey at that women&rsquo;s international event there were so many people who came up and said how inspired they were. So I believe there are many things I need to put out there to inspire women specifically.</p><p> Leslie Stone is an award-winning writer, editor and journalist with more than two decades of experience covering business, finance, real estate and lifestyle issues for newspapers, magazines and online publications.

{"original_id":5076,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Reasons You Behave Irrationally When It Comes to Money","link":"reasons-you-behave-irrationally-when-it-comes-to-money","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nm_news\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Northwestern Mutual Insights &amp; Ideas Team  </u> </a></p><p> Financial planning involves a series of seemingly endless decisions. Should you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan? Where should you put money for the best investment return? Should you save less for your child&rsquo;s education to save more for your retirement?</p><p> Whenever you&rsquo;re confronted with having to make these decisions, you become a test case for behavioral economics, a discipline that explores irrational thinking and economic decision making in a person&rsquo;s daily life.</p><p> Even if you are a rational thinker, you may exhibit behavior that is predictably irrational when it comes to money. If you can recognize irrational behavior, you can take steps to avoid it and make better financial decisions. Do you show signs of any of the following?</p><h3> <strong>  Anchoring:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Anchoring is defined as the heavy reliance on one piece of information (anchoring to it) when making a decision. The information in question may not be accurate or even logical. It might simply be a reference for comparison.</p><p> A classic example involves clothes shopping. Who hasn&rsquo;t spotted clothing with an enormous price markdown? In this scenario, the original price is provided as an anchor, something for comparison. The new price becomes a &ldquo;steal&rdquo; too good to resist. But is it really?</p><p> While retailers provide anchors, investors often create them in their own minds. A stock, mutual fund, vacant land or rental apartment building that has dropped in price may look attractive relative to its previous high price. In reality, the lower price may still be too high.</p><p> Avoid being drawn into anchoring by not limiting yourself to a single point of view. Seek information from a variety of sources, and view situations from different perspectives.</p><h3> <strong>  Loss Aversion:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Why is it that a gain in retirement accounts at the end of the year doesn&rsquo;t feel as good as an equivalent loss feels painful? Loss hurts approximately twice as much, according to research in the paper &ldquo; <a href=\"http://prospect-theory.behaviouralfinance.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Prospect Theory: An analysis of decision under risk. </a> &rdquo;</p><p> Loss aversion explains, in part, why retirement savings-account contributions are usually automatically deducted from a paycheck. If you had to actively deduct retirement savings, health insurance and taxes after getting paid, behavioral economists say your sense of loss would increase. You&rsquo;d likely still pull out money to pay Uncle Sam, but you&rsquo;d also be less inclined to consistently contribute the same amount or more to your savings plan.</p><p> Loss aversion applies to potential investment losses as well. Fear of loss can cause you to make investment decisions that are too safe, resulting in low returns that may just barely keep up with rising costs.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re someone who likes to invest in the stock market, you probably understand the concept of loss aversion as it applies to a poorly performing stock. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for an investor to keep a poor performer when evidence suggests it should be sold. An investor hoping to avoid the pain of lost money by keeping a stock that should be sold may be exhibiting loss aversion.</p><p> If you find yourself in any of these situations, stop and think them through. Simply being aware of the irrational extent to which you might go to avoid real or perceived loss may help you make better financial decisions.</p><h3> <strong>  Procrastination:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Writer Oscar Wilde is credited with having once said, &ldquo;I never put off till tomorrow what I can do the day after.&rdquo; This sentiment might have worked for him, but it&rsquo;s a terrible way to approach financial planning.</p><p> Why do people so often procrastinate when it comes to financial planning? Behavioral economists say it has to do with  <a href=\"http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/85.full\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  temporal discounting </a> , valuing immediate gains over future gains. This helps to explain why you might firmly believe eating right is good for long-term health, but a chocolate sundae available right now quiets your inner rational voice.</p><p> On a financial level, temporal discounting is a big reason not everyone who can participate in an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan actually does so. It seems logical that any employee offered an employer-matching contribution typical of these savings plans, essentially free money, would take it. Yet, according to the American Benefits Council, approximately 13 percent of eligible participants do not enroll when the plan is offered.</p><p> Some employers, in an effort to increase plan participation rates, have positioned them as opt-out plans instead of opt-in. Employees have to actively decide not to participate. Framing participation this way tends to increase employee participation rates.</p><p> If procrastination is like bedrock to your way of thinking, can you overcome it? Yes. You could try pre-committing to a deadline for the activity in question and self-imposing a costly penalty for missing it. Studies have demonstrated that this tactic works.</p><h3> Become Your Own Ally</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to financial planning, you can learn to avoid irrational behaviors. Additionally, a financial professional can assist by helping you to identify your goals and implementing a financial plan to help you reach them. A financial plan can help you see how your decisions impact your finances. Taking these steps can help you avoid succumbing to innate irrationality. </p><p> <a href=\"https://www.northwesternmutual.com/financial-guidance/financial-basics?intcmp=NM-DebtCenter-financialbasics_section?intcmp=NM-InsightsandIdeas-InsightsandIdeas-FinancialBasicsResourceCtr_BannersGeneral\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5-ways-to-make-your-money-work-for-you.png\" width=\"341\"/> </a></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 17:46:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 17:46:18.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_d8lAi9I.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/reasons-you-behave-irrationally-when-it-comes-to-money/\", \"post_id\": \"10812\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 17:46:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 17:46:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"reasons-you-behave-irrationally-when-it-comes-to-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10810\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5277\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Reasons-You-Behave-Irrationally-When-It-Comes-to-Money.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"862\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462404600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5077,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Have These 6 Metrics of Trust With Your Clients?","link":"do-you-have-these-6-metrics-of-trust-with-your-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Bill Bachrach</p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if your clients told you exactly how much they trust you? What would you do with that information? How would it help you help your clients? Would they be more likely to follow your advice? How would that impact their success and yours? </p><p> I believe your clients are telling you how much they trust you with the most effective and predictable communication method that exists: behavior. Ralph Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s famous quote applies here, &ldquo;What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.&rdquo; What your clients do, or do not do, is speaking loudly about trust. Are you listening?</p><h3> I call these the &ldquo;metrics&rdquo; of trust and they are: <br/>  </h3><li> How receptive to comprehensive financial services and advice are each of your clients?</li><li> Have they consolidated all of their business with you?</li><li> Do they act on your advice with relatively little &ldquo;selling&rdquo; or the need to use &ldquo;persuasion&rdquo; or &ldquo;closing&rdquo; techniques?</li><li> Are they more influenced by your advice than the negative emotions related to market, economic, political or world events?</li><li> Do they pay your fee without quibbling or haggling?</li><li> To what degree do they either offer unsolicited referrals or respond positively when you ask them to introduce you to their friends, family and colleagues? <br/>  </li><p> If your clients have an imaginary trust dial embedded in their subconscious, and they do, where does the needle on that trust dial have to be so your clients trust you completely? And if you are dealing with spouses or partners, keep in mind that there are two separate trust dials at work. <br/> Would you like to have clients who are fully comprehensive, consolidate all of their business with you, act on your advice, are more influenced by your advice than negative world events, happily pay your fee and consistently introduce you to their friends, family and colleagues? The key is trust.</p><p> Most of what&rsquo;s involved in building trust is within your control. It&rsquo;s also helpful to keep in mind that some people can&rsquo;t trust. Establishing trust with someone who can&rsquo;t trust is like trying to teach someone with a morbid fear of sharks to surf. Even if it&rsquo;s possible, it&rsquo;s not worth the time.</p><p> This also has little to do with how trustworthy you are. For the sake of this article, I am going to assume that you are trustworthy from both the competence and character sides of trust. I&rsquo;m sure you find it frustrating to be trustworthy and have some people not trust you. Trust is for them to decide about you, not something you can declare.</p><p> The truth about how much each of your clients trusts you is a simple, honest assessment by you and your team of all six metrics of trust for each of your clients. How does that work?</p><h3> <strong>  Metric 1 </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s take the first metric.</p><p> What are your clients telling you if they look to you for advice in all areas of financial services? What does it say about how much they trust you if they only do business with you in one area of financial services, say investments or insurance? <br/> It could be as simple as you are not clearly communicating everything you can do for them. Or is it that they trust you enough to do some business with you, but not enough to work with you across all areas of financial services? Your clients&rsquo; willingness to be engaged in a holistic relationship vs. a la carte transactions is a metric of how much they trust you. What is their behavior in this area telling you about how much they trust you? On a scale of 1-10, what&rsquo;s the score?</p><p> Having multiple advisors is not diversification.</p><h3> <strong>  Metric 2 </strong></h3><p> <br/> Metric No. 2 means that when your clients have their money spread among several advisors and institutions they are sending the message that they don&rsquo;t trust any of you enough. You know your clients trust you completely when they have consolidated all of their investments with you.</p><p> Consolidated doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that all of their money has been transferred into an account at your firm. What about the money they have in places where it can&rsquo;t be transferred into those accounts? Does that money still fall under your advice and are they willing to pay you for that? What is their behavior in this area telling you about how much they trust you? On a scale of 1-10, what&rsquo;s the score?</p><p> I&rsquo;ve seen research about how wealthy people having their investments spread among several advisors. Institutions used to justify that this is just how wealthy people &ldquo;are,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not changeable, and you should be happy with a good-size account even if it&rsquo;s only a part of what they have. This is ridiculous. The much better lesson, and the good news for you, is that they have not yet met someone they trust enough to consolidate all of their money with one advisor. Why couldn&rsquo;t that person be you? Wealthy people value simplification. Is it simpler to have multiple advisors and institutions even when that doesn&rsquo;t add any value? Will you become the person they trust enough to consolidate all of their assets with? Or will that be someone else?</p><h3> <strong>  Metric 3 </strong></h3><p> <br/> The third metric is how readily they act on your advice. Have you ever given someone advice and without any hesitation they said, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s trust. Even the most analytical people are capable of trusting at this level. The more you are trusted, the more quickly your clients act on your advice with less information, education or discussion. If you feel like you&rsquo;re &ldquo;closing,&rdquo; the trust level is low. What would have to happen for you to become the advisor who exudes that level of trust? What is their behavior in this area telling you about how much they trust you? On a scale of 1-10, what&rsquo;s the score?</p><h3> <strong>  Metric 4 </strong></h3><p> <br/> The fourth metric is the degree to which your clients are more influenced by you than they are by all the negative events in the world that are very effectively exaggerated, embellished and spun by smart and articulate people who deliver the &ldquo;news.&rdquo; When the crap hit the fan a few years ago, did your clients stay the course of their plan or did they make you sell low, against your advice? What has to happen to move the needle on the trust dial so your clients are more influenced by you than their emotional reaction to events out of their control? What is their behavior in this area telling you about how much they trust you? <br/> On a scale of 1-10, what&rsquo;s the score?</p><h3> <strong>  Metric 5 </strong></h3><p> <br/> The fifth metric is about your compensation. First of all, is ALL of your compensation totally transparent and fully disclosed? Are ALL of the costs of doing business with you totally transparent and fully disclosed, not just the money that you get paid? And are they happy to pay whatever that is?</p><p> If there is debate about your fee, it could mean more than just a cheap client. There could be a trust issue at work. When that needle on the trust dial moves farther to the right, your clients will be happy to pay the fee, provided, of course, there is a good value. What is their behavior in this area telling you about how much they trust you? On a scale of 1-10, what&rsquo;s the score?</p><p> And that brings us to metric No. 6: referrals. I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to believe that your clients have to trust you more to refer you to their friends, family and colleagues than the level of trust required for them to do business with you. A referral and introduction puts their most important relationships at risk. If you drop the ball, it reflects badly on them. So, do they refer you? How involved are they willing to be to make a warm introduction?</p><p> Obviously, there&rsquo;s a significant trust difference between, &ldquo;Call so-and-so, but don&rsquo;t use my name&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Give Bob a call later this week after I have the chance to speak with him and tell him how much I trust you and what a great job you have done for me.&rdquo; And don&rsquo;t believe it for a moment if you ever hear, &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t refer.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not-very-encrypted code for, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust you enough to risk my relationships with my friends, family and colleagues to make those introductions.&rdquo; Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to be trusted that much. What is their behavior in this area telling you about how much they trust you? On a scale of 1-10, what&rsquo;s the score?</p><h3> <strong>  Now what? </strong></h3><p> <br/> How do you use this information to become a better advisor for your clients and a more successful advisor for yourself and your family? The first step is an assessment to discover the truth about the level of trust that exists with your clients based on their behavior against these six metrics.</p><p> Essentially, the way it works is that you enter the name for each of your clients and assess where they stand in each of these six areas. Using a simple 1-10 scoring system, your trust score with that client could be a maximum of 60. It will be very apparent where you want to improve your value delivery or strengthen the relationship to move the needle on the trust dial to where both you and the client would prefer it to be.</p><p> Make it your goal to become the kind of advisor and communicator who can move the needle on the trust dial to create a clientele who are fully comprehensive, consolidate all of their business with you, act on your advice, are more influenced by you than negative external events, happily pay your fee and consistently introduce you to their friends, family and colleagues.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 17:46:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 17:46:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_XSxHDgG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-have-these-6-metrics-of-trust-with-your-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"10814\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 17:46:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 17:46:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-have-these-6-metrics-of-trust-with-your-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10813\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5278\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-You-Have-These-6-Metrics-of-Trust-with-Your-Clients.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"684\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462348800,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

Performance, risk and correlation projections are based on market simulations, where what &ldquo;should&rdquo; happen is at best a mathematical hypothesis about - and most definitely not the same thing as - what &ldquo;will&rdquo; happen in a real market environment.</p><p> As I was reminded by Janet Yellen a few weeks ago when <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/13512444/2/yellen-s-comments-moved-markets-but-are-fed-forecasts-accurate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I was fortunate enough to talk briefly with her one-on-one at the Economic Club of New York </a> , &ldquo;[investment and economic] projections are based on estimates&rdquo; (yes, estimates on estimates) and that &ldquo;assessments [about how interest rates, etc. might perform in the future] contain a considerable amount of uncertainty.&rdquo;</p><p> Think about all the potential risks and costs discussed above for a minute: lack of transparency, illiquidity, inadequate risk evaluation mechanisms, models based on estimates, taxes and the potential for high and layered fees.</p><p> Might these factors outweigh the allure of &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; and the possible benefits of adding complexity in quest of the optimal portfolio?</p><h3> I am not suggesting that individual, outlier portfolio managers and strategies don&rsquo;t exist from time to time.</h3><p> <br/> We all want to believe that investment stars in shining risk protection armor will endure, but investors would be wise to reminder that even Camelot didn&rsquo;t last forever.</p><p> History, and a lot of solid research data, teaches us that past performance is very often not indicative of future returns and that even complex models, as impressively as they may seem, often break-down at the wrong time.</p><p> As a prime example, during the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis, many asset classes that models said were not highly correlated became highly correlated very quickly on the downside.  During the recovery, many so-called diversification investments then provided only limited upside participation.</p><p> As fiduciaries on behalf of clients, our families or the trusts, endowments or public funds for which we are trustees, we should be cautious when sales presentations boast too much about the records of investing kings.</p><p> Before investing in a hedge fund grail quest, consider the following question:</p><p> Does the presentation and presenter of the pitch openly discuss all potential costs?</p><p> If issues such as lack of transparency, illiquidity, inadequate risk evaluation mechanisms, taxes, and the potential for layered fees remain in the shadows, beware.</p><p> As Pasty reminded King Arthur, Galahad and Lancelot in the sage wisdom that was Monty Python:</p><p> &ldquo;Camelot!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Camelot!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Camelot!&rdquo;</p><p> [No]</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a model.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 17:54:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 17:54:43.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_d3VoMZF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-shadow-costs-of-hedge-funds-outweigh-any-potential-holy-grail-benefits/\", \"post_id\": \"10815\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 17:54:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 17:54:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-shadow-costs-of-hedge-funds-outweigh-any-potential-holy-grail-benefits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10813\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5279\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-You-Have-These-6-Metrics-of-Trust-with-Your-Clients.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"678\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462363200,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5079,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Why Email Marketing Is Worth the Time Investment","link":"5-reasons-why-email-marketing-is-worth-the-time-investment","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I didn&rsquo;t intend to write about why email marketing is still a necessity for 2016 marketing strategies, but people keep asking me about its relevance.</p><p> Yes, email marketing is still very, very important. And that&rsquo;s no exaggeration.</p><p> But the typical business owner gets distracted by all the new shiny social networks. And I get it &ndash; there&rsquo;s so many.</p><p> However, it will be a long time before email marketing is replaced, if ever. I think our current process, tools, and apps will change, but we&rsquo;ll always have an &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; to receive messages from the outside world that isn&rsquo;t connected to a social network.</p><p> Can you imagine a world without email? And before you say, heck yes &ndash; I&rsquo;d love it! Think about how you would reach out professionally or share intimate letters with someone. Or promote to them.</p><p> My inbox is magical for me. It&rsquo;s the singular place someone can reach me without my getting distracted by a bajillion other things. It&rsquo;s crazy how calm I feel when checking email versus going to reply to a Facebook Message or Twitter DM.</p><p> Emails still have their own place, and when it comes to marketing &ndash; there&rsquo;s no difference. Even though some marketers or biz owners talk down about email marketing, the power hasn&rsquo;t waned.</p><p> The biggest reason it gets so much pushback is that it&rsquo;s hard. Because most email marketers don&rsquo;t respect the person who signed up, and consumers are being more protective with their email accounts.</p><p> Can you blame them? A few weeks ago, I signed up for a newsletter, but was hounded by so many emails within the first week that I hit the Unsubscribed button with exertion!</p><p> But that&rsquo;s another subject.</p><p> Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about WHY Email Marketing Is Still KEY in your marketing efforts. And why it&rsquo;s worth the time investment. </p><h3> 1. There&rsquo;s nothing more intimate than the inbox.</h3><p> Besides getting someone&rsquo;s phone number, what is more intimate than their email address? Especially as a business owner or marketing professional.</p><p> When you give someone a reason to pass along their email address, you&rsquo;re in. And I mean IN. You&rsquo;ve got a one way ticket to their heart, a direct line to their time, and that&rsquo;s valuable.</p><p> But you&rsquo;ve got to prove your emails are worth it! You&rsquo;ve got to provide value, at the right time, and at the right frequency.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t downplay the fact that getting a new email subscriber is a major deal, and should be regarded with honor. It&rsquo;s not to be taken advantage of with constant promotion, and it&rsquo;s wise to segment your subscribers so you&rsquo;re able to speak directly to the reader.</p><p> Understand who your subscribers are, make sure to segment out lists, and craft emails for each one.</p><h3> 2. You can say whatever you&rsquo;d like.</h3><p> Once you&rsquo;re IN, then you&rsquo;ve got the opportunity to say whatever you&rsquo;d like!</p><p> Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should, in fact &ndash; don&rsquo;t. But my point is that you&rsquo;re given the reins to tell stories, share information, provide excerpts to new blogs, promotions or even pictures of your kids/family.</p><p> Bottom line, you can start building relationships. You can start communicating one on one, and sharing yourself or your brand with the reader.</p><h3> 3. Subscribers actually want to hear from you.</h3><p> If I give out my email address, I want to hear from you!</p><p> And that&rsquo;s pure gold. It&rsquo;s not Facebook or Instagram or other social networks where people just want to hang out, but have to constantly duck the ads. It&rsquo;s their inbox.</p><p> And if people sign up for your newsletter then they&rsquo;re saying yes, email me &ndash; BUT make sure it&rsquo;s good. They don&rsquo;t want to receive content that won&rsquo;t help them or their business life in some way. So adding value should always be your main priority &ndash; not sales.</p><p> Those come after people fall in love with you.</p><h3> 4. Your email list is YOURS.</h3><p> Probably one of the biggest arguments for email marketing is that regardless of what any social network decides to do in the future, your email list won&rsquo;t be affected.</p><p> That means if Facebook decides to pack up and head home for good, you won&rsquo;t lose your audience or your dedicated marketing place. Or if Twitter wants to start charging, you can roll your eyes and walk away.</p><p> Building an email list is the smartest and fastest way to build a legit audience that wants to hear from you and will be open to what you have to say in an intimate setting.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s priceless.</p><h3> 5. It&rsquo;s part of the 3 core strategies.</h3><p> Email marketing plays a crucial part in the success of true social media marketing. That  <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/the-secret-recipe-for-successful-social-media-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  secret formula </a> includes content creation (blogging, videos), email marketing, and social media marketing.</p><p> These three combined can slaughter any social strategy because they&rsquo;re working in conjunction with each other to create a major power punch.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t just market to people on social media because you don&rsquo;t own those networks, they have no loyalty to you. You can&rsquo;t utilize social networks without native content. And you can&rsquo;t push both the social networks and the native content to a more direct place than the inbox.</p><p> Boom.</p><h3> Final thoughts</h3><p> Email marketing is DEFINITELY a weapon you want in your marketing arsenal. So build a list, develop a community, and rock it out!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 17:57:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 17:57:09.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_nKrhrOE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-reasons-why-email-marketing-is-worth-the-time-investment/\", \"post_id\": \"10817\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 17:57:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 17:57:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-reasons-why-email-marketing-is-worth-the-time-investment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10816\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5280\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5-Reasons-Why-Email-Marketing-Is-Worth-the-Time-Investment.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"587\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462352400,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}

Because of this, you have a great opportunity to learn more about your prospects and clients if you learn how to ask the right questions at the right times.</p><p> Here are some examples of how asking for help, at the right time, can give you a treasure trove of useful information you can use to position your product or service to the right person.</p><p> When prospecting, if you don&rsquo;t know the person or department you need to speak with, there is no better opening then:  <strong>  &ldquo;Hi, I need a little bit of help please&hellip;&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Now the crucial thing here is not to then ask a question. Instead, what&rsquo;s important is that you actually wait for the other person to offer to help you first. As soon as they say, &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can help you,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s when you reply with something like:</p><p> &ldquo;Thanks. I&rsquo;m looking for the person who handles your lead generation, who would that be please?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  If they don&rsquo;t know the name, then be prepared with: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Perhaps you could point me to the right department then?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Asking for help in this way is also useful when you ask for someone and they aren&rsquo;t there any longer. Also, it&rsquo;s great for when you do reach someone and they turn out to be the wrong contact. When that happens use: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Oh I see. Perhaps you can help then. Who would be the best person to speak with&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I see. Can you point me in the right direction please?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;O.K., perhaps you can help me: who would be the best person for me to speak with in terms of ordering your XYZ supplies?&rdquo;</p><p> These techniques are great for finding the right person or department to speak with. But the power of this technique goes far beyond that.</p><p> <strong>  Use the following types of &ldquo;help&rdquo; questions once you do reach the appropriate prospect: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Perhaps you can help me understand how you handle your XYZ process. How do you get involved in that?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;__________, we have a lot of solutions that may be a fit, but I don&rsquo;t want to bombard you. Perhaps you can help give me a brief understanding of who handles what, and then I&rsquo;ll be able to know who would be the best person for some of this. Let&rsquo;s start with you &ndash; what do take care of there?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;_________, could you help me understand how this flows at your company? Who handles XYZ&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;_________, help me understand how the decision process works over there. How do you get involved?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;__________, I need a little bit of help to understand your org chart &ndash; who do you report to?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Perhaps you can help me: I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got a lot of people handling different things, let&rsquo;s start with the part of the process you handle: what is that?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Layer with: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;And who handles the other parts?&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, there are a lot of applications for the &ldquo;I need a little bit of help, please&rdquo; technique. Now a word of caution: don&rsquo;t underestimate how powerful this is. While it seems simple, it is actually a very effective technique if used appropriately.</p><p> When asking for help, genuinely mean it. Use your voice inflection and timing. Remember to always wait for them to offer to help you!</p><p> If you master this technique you&rsquo;ll find that you won&rsquo;t have to work so hard to find things out. People, because they sincerely want to help, will help you &ndash; if you ask.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 18:02:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 18:02:34.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_pQitsaj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/theres-no-better-opening-than-this-when-asking-for-help/\", \"post_id\": \"10819\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 18:02:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 18:02:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"theres-no-better-opening-than-this-when-asking-for-help\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10818\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5281\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Theres-No-Better-Opening-Than-This-When-Asking-for-Help.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"516\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462366800,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

One you&rsquo;d happily hang with all day long if only you could.</p><p> So if you&rsquo;re an executive coach, maybe Marshall Goldsmith is your gold standard.</p><p> Or you&rsquo;re a strategy consultant and you&rsquo;re busily checking out Jim Collins or McKinsey, Bain and BCG.</p><p> Sales experts are watching Jill Konrath, Tony Iannarino, Jeff Shore and their peers.</p><p> But if you stop there, you&rsquo;re missing the chance to think beyond the boundaries of your niche. Which means your positioning, your message and your marketing may not be as rich&mdash;and distinctive&mdash;as you can make it.</p><p> So instead of thinking of the competition as you work to position yourself and your firm, start thinking about your brand neighborhood.</p><p> When I&rsquo;m working on a brand strategy, I always develop a brand neighborhood short list. Sure, I start with competitors, but I&rsquo;m casting a wide net to identify people and firms that have a similar look and feel to the essence of my client. To give them a visual reference to how far they could take their brand.</p><p> You can do the same exercise for your business (or your personal brand). Start by making a list of the people and firms and products that catch your eye, even as you go about your daily life. Be open and anything can grab you, from an arresting PSA commercial to a cool website that sells razor blades to a billboard hawking the next blockbuster.</p><p> Throw their URL on your list. And keep trolling for fresh inspiration.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve got a good 10-20 or so that truly intrigue you, scroll through them and you&rsquo;ll be able to pinpoint the themes that attracted you.</p><p> What&mdash;and it might just be one small thing&mdash;speaks to you? Is it their core message? Their visual appeal? How their copy makes you (fill in the blank): think, laugh, wonder, shout &ldquo;aha&rdquo;?</p><p> Jot down your observations and feelings while they&rsquo;re fresh.</p><p> What you&rsquo;ll gather from this exercise is a giant clue to where you need to go with your brand. Maybe it&rsquo;s doubling down on what you&rsquo;re already rocking or admitting it&rsquo;s time for a serious overhaul.</p><p> When I moved to my current visual branding, I was inspired by a photo of a classic high-ceilinged, creamy Paris apartment trimmed out with red and orange pops of color. My brand neighborhood grew to include Seth Godin, Dan Pink and Ellen DeGeneres (even though no one will EVER mistake me for a comedian).</p><p> Why them? I wanted visceral inspiration to focus on encouraging consultants to think big(ger). To convince them to step up to being unforgettable. To midwife the dreams they&rsquo;d placed on simmer.</p><p> It made all the difference&mdash;and led to a top to bottom marketing and branding overhaul.</p><p> Take a look at your own inspiration. Who&rsquo;s in YOUR brand neighborhood&mdash;and what are they whispering to you?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-03 18:11:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-03 18:11:26.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_l2XeZyq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-have-the-right-people-in-your-brand-neighborhood/\", \"post_id\": \"10820\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-03 18:11:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-03 18:11:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-have-the-right-people-in-your-brand-neighborhood\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10818\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5282\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Theres-No-Better-Opening-Than-This-When-Asking-for-Help.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"554\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462388400,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5082,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways to Differentiate Yourself and Stand Apart from Your Competitors","link":"7-ways-to-differentiate-yourself-and-stand-apart-from-your-competitors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This is one of the most common questions I get from my clients: <strong>   &ldquo;Our market is commoditizing and getting more and more competitive. How can we differentiate ourselves more clearly and effectively?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> There are, of course, many corporate-level strategies that can be used to make your company more competitive. But let&rsquo;s leave those aside and focus here on what you personally can change, right away. So in the rest of this article I&rsquo;m going to share seven things you can do to better distinguish yourself&ndash;and at the same time, your firm&ndash;as you work with clients.</p><h3> <strong>  Know more about them. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Learn more about their business, organization, and issues than anyone else. Also learn more about their personal aspirations and challenges than anyone else. When you do, you will no longer be a commodity. This is why most people rarely fire their personal physician or personal accountant&ndash;they know us, our history, what&rsquo;s important to us, and what we need. They are worth more to us than the next doctor or accountant off the street, who may have a fancy degree but zero understanding of who we are.</p><h3> <strong>  Be Fresh. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I am oh-so-tired of clich&eacute;s: &ldquo;You need to put on your own oxygen mask before you can help others&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;The Chinese word for crisis combines the characters for opportunity and danger (actually that&rsquo;s not even true)&rdquo;; or, questions like &ldquo;What keeps you up at night?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What would it take for us to win your business?&rdquo; These are uninspiring expressions&ndash;hearing them is like listening to one of those 1970s FM radio hits for the 10,000th time.</p><p> Be fresh. Be original. Be provocative. Don&rsquo;t just repeat what everyone else is saying. You don&rsquo;t have to be a Peter Drucker or an Albert Einstein: Take your experiences, pick a topic of interest to your clients, and boil your ideas down to four or five incisive points to share with them. Go against the grain: Is there a so-called &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; or technology that&rsquo;s all the rage? Tell your clients why it may not last or be right for them, if believe that&rsquo;s true. Sound fresh, not bland and boring.</p><h3> <strong>  Have a Unique Relationship Process. </strong></h3><p> <br/> One way of differentiating yourself is through the actual process you use to interact with your clients and manage your relationship with them. This contributes to a sense on the client&rsquo;s part that &ldquo;working with them is different.&rdquo; This can start with the business development process, by the way, and how you handle it&ndash;the client doesn&rsquo;t have to wait until they&rsquo;ve hired you to experience the difference. You can engineer, standardize, and carefully manage many different aspects of your client interactions&ndash;for example:</p><li> Telling versus asking: The way you balance advocacy and inquiry in your conversations, and the kinds of careful, thought-provoking questions you ask</li><li> Speed of response: How quickly to you get back to your client with things you&rsquo;ve promised? How quickly do you answer your emails and phone calls (even if to say you&rsquo;re tied up with a client but will thoughtfully respond the next morning)?</li><li> Collaboration: How you involve them in the upfront problem-solving and solution development around your products and services</li><li> Education: How you create opportunities to transfer your capabilities to the client&rsquo;s own people</li><li> Meeting management: Using an efficient and effective process to make meetings more productive and collaborative <br/>  </li><p> The sky is the limit in terms of the ways in which you can structure a consistent set of client interactions that convey your unique stamp.</p><h3> <strong>  Develop a Personal Style. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Adopt a few, small habits and ways of communicating, and they will become a kind of signature for you. When I lived in Rome, I got around using a small motorscooter. Because it&rsquo;s difficult to carry a hard leather briefcase on a scooter, I used a soft Lands End blue canvas bag to carry my papers as I went around the city visiting my clients. Inadvertently, I developed a certain style that my Italian clients found quite endearing (so they told me). I was wearing custom-made Italian wool suits like them, but instead of using my own driver or taking a taxi, I was riding alla Romana on a scooter&ndash;and carrying around that downmarket, yet in their eyes, &ldquo;chic&rdquo; Lands End bag.</p><p> Maybe your personal style is always dressing well, no matter how casual the occasion&ndash;or, always dressing casually (my friend and CEO coach Marshall Goldsmith consistently wears tan Khaki pants and a button down shirt at workshops, for example). My co-author Jerry Panas uses stationary that is unique and sends a lot of personal notes to people&ndash;as soon as you see those beautiful envelops in your mail, even before you see the return address, you know Jerry has written to you.</p><h3> <strong>  Bring Their Ideas to Life. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Innovation is a big topic, and much has been written about how to stir more innovation in large organizations. I love coming up with new ideas myself&ndash;however, many top executives will tell you that their challenge is not coming up with new ideas, it&rsquo;s taking some of the ideas they already haveand doing a great job of implementing them and turning them into real business. You will stand out from the crowd if you can be seen as someone who has the patience, discipline, and practical know-how to show a client how to take a concept they have&ndash;but which hasn&rsquo;t gotten off the ground&ndash;and make it a reality.</p><h3> <strong>  Show You Really Care.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your clients are living their businesses and their organization 24/7. This is their professional lifeblood. They know you care about YOUR business&ndash;of course you do. But do you really value and care about THEIRS? Or, is it just another job for you&ndash;another day, another dollar&ndash;as the expression goes? This is something else that sets the personal physician or personal accountant apart from the person who makes the one-off visit to your house to fix your clogged sink. Clients want to work with advisors and service providers who are interested in and care about what they do and about their people.</p><p> How do you show you care? Take an actual interest in their business&ndash;its history, how it works, the customers they serve, the products they sell, the people they hire, and so on. Be curious. Spend time &ldquo;off the clock&rdquo; to understand their organization. Go talk to a few of their clients or customers. Learn about their values and beliefs as an organization&ndash;about their culture.</p><h3> <strong>  Build a Better Relationship.   </strong></h3><p> <br/> This had to be on my list, right? This isn&rsquo;t about just being &ldquo;liked&rdquo; better than the next person. A strong relationship provides many powerful benefits&ndash;here are just two: First, it enables you to accomplish point 1 on my list&ndash;to know more about your client than your competitors.

{"original_id":5084,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Spy Tricks to Create Trust with Others","link":"5-spy-tricks-to-create-trust-with-others","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As a counterintelligence FBI agent, people ask me how I could create trust when I lied to the targets of my undercover investigation about my identity.</h3><p> <br/> In my book,  <a href=\"http://amzn.to/Z7CFsD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Secrets of A Strong Mind  </u>  , </a>  I talk about why building trust with oneself is as important as building trust with others. I only ran into trouble in undercover cases when I tried to be someone other than who I really am, beneath the surface. I never lied to the targets of my undercover investigations about the important things in life.</p><p> This is the secret: I was always authentic. A person can slap on a different name or title, but who they are as a person does not change.</p><p> Building trust was difficult when developing human intelligence sources (HUMINT)&mdash; people from the community who knew and worked with the spy I was trying to recruit. These are people I met in my true name and identity. I still could not always be as transparent as they (or I) would have liked in discussing my future plans because that information was classified.</p><p> I found these interactions to be a straddle between interrogation and conversation, never daring to cross over too far in either direction. I needed their cooperation so I tried to keep the interaction all very conversational, and yet they were meeting and doing business with a member of a hostile intelligence service. So there were times when I felt the need to dig my teeth in and&mdash;yes, interrogate.</p><p> Trust ran both ways. I trusted them not to run back to the spy and divulge every detail of my conversation with them. The spy business is not the only area that it&rsquo;s hard to establish trust.</p><p> How can leaders build the truth needed for authentic conversation in an era of deceit and cynicism? It is tempting to be judgmental about what is, or is not, considered to be a lie.</p><p> The question is not whether people lie, it&rsquo;s what are they lying about? Are they stretching their optimism and hoping business will turn around? Or are they creating a fabrication like Bernie Madoff? Is the CEO telling a half-truth or are they merely omitting an important piece of information?</p><p> Here are five things to keep in mind about building trust with others:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Remember that people deceive themselves as much as they deceive others. </strong></h3><p> <br/> People are capable of deceiving themselves into believing any number of things&mdash;sometimes they exaggerate their own importance or abilities to impress others. Sometimes they&rsquo;re too critical of their own efforts and don&rsquo;t give themselves enough credit for their accomplishments.</p><p> We know what it feels like to fall into the snare of self-deception or self-limiting beliefs&mdash;with luck, only briefly. The incredible thing about self-deception is that not only are we telling a lie, but it&rsquo;s ourselves we are lying to! We all have blind spots about our own performance and the better we&rsquo;re able to understand them, the more empowered we will be.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Not all deceit is equal. </strong></h3><p> <br/> All of us have taken steps to improve ourselves in the sight of others. This is cosmetic deceit and it refers to our efforts to make ourselves look better than we are. It can be a dab of make-up to hide a blemish or the use of words to hide an imperfection in our work performance that we&rsquo;d rather not broadcast to the world. I&rsquo;ve used cosmetic deceit when dealing with others, such as compliments on hair, performance, or a sermon with the intention of making the other person feel better and soften the edges of an embarrassment.</p><p> I used deceit on a superficial level when working undercover counterintelligence cases. Even so, it&rsquo;s impossible to develop authentic trust&mdash;this is why undercover agents are &ldquo;cutout&rdquo; and replaced by an FBI agent utilizing their true identity. Authentic trust is impossible to build if it is based on deception or ulterior motives. You can only move to a certain point in a relationship if it is not built around trust, so the undercover agents were moved out to bring in agents who could move the relationship to the next step.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Authentic trust is built when there&rsquo;s a commitment to the relationship. </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the same way, authentic conversations are built when there&rsquo;s a  <a href=\"http://www.leadershipnow.com/CoveyOnTrust.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  commitment to growing </a>  and deepening the relationship, not just to maintain the status quo. If the relationship is the central consideration, mutual commitments are essential to avoid concerns about manipulation or control in the conversation. A strong leader is one who is capable of building trust by creating authentic relationships regardless of title or position.</p><h3> <strong>  4. People assess information differently when they believe it&rsquo;s true. </strong></h3><p> <br/> A few years ago, Joel and Ethan Coen produced a movie called Fargo. It tells the story of a kidnapping case that goes deadly wrong. The opening credits announced that the movie is based on a true story. Journalists could not find any reference to the crime depicted in the movie, and eventually the producers admitted that it was all fiction. The Coen brothers explained that they believed that if the movie were represented as a true story, it would have more credibility with the audience.</p><p> We enter into relationships with the same desire for honesty because experience has shown that honesty is the foundation upon which trust is built.</p><h3> <strong>  5. We are empowered when we have the courage to trust others. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The Bible reminds us in the letter to the Ephesians that when we  <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/how-to-build-trust.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  do good unto others </a> , we are most fully ourselves:</p><li> When you look for the good in others, they will show it to you.</li><li> When you appreciate the worth in others, it&rsquo;s easy for them to be their best.</li><li> When you accept others, they show you their strengths.</li><li> When you notice others, they feel like they belong and are special.</li><li> When you need others, they feel the good in themselves.</li><li> When you look for the beauty in others, you will discover your own best self.</li><li> When you bring out the best in others, you make powerful friends.</li><li> When you find the gift of others, you find reasons to believe in yourself. <br/>  </li><p> What is trust to you? How do you build authentic trust with others?

It's Time to Look to the Mound.","link":"business-as-usual-no-longer-winning-the-game-its-time-to-look-to-the-mound","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"//insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=qoe326g&amp;ct=0:v0ks54e&amp;fmt=3\" width=\"1\"/></p><p> Written by: Tom Dorsey, Co-founder, Dorsey, Wright &amp; Associates, a Nasdaq Company</p><p> Your business is changing&mdash;fast. Robo advisors are offering to do your job for free (or close to it). Regulatory changes are eating up your time and your resources. And as your client base gets younger, &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; simply isn&rsquo;t winning business any more.</p><h3> <strong>  So what can you do to change course? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The key is taking a close look at the mound and making the right changes at the right time to begin to deliver a level of performance your clients no longer simply wish for, but demand.</p><p> I know. I know. Your clients are risk-averse&mdash;especially the ones with the greatest assets. But while the oldest set may stay put with steady but less-than-stellar performance from their portfolios, younger clients who will drive your business in a decade won&rsquo;t. The good news: there&rsquo;s a simple way to enhance performance without increasing risk. It has nothing to do with timing the market, and everything to do with leveraging the basic laws of physics&mdash;and baseball&mdash;to deliver a level of performance that helps you provide greater value to your clients and earn your keep&mdash;even when facing a robo-competitor that promises to rebalance and reallocate on a dime at little or no cost.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve all seen pitchers getting swapped out of a great game of baseball. Your home-team pitcher opened with a strong arm, struck out a stream of hitters, and allowed only a single run. Sure, he walked a guy&hellip;or two, but it&rsquo;s the top of the fourth and he looks like he&rsquo;s still doing great. So you&rsquo;re surprised to see the coach walk to the mound, say a few words and, for no obvious reason, send the winning pitcher to the dugout as a replacement heads in from the bullpen. But why the change, you wonder? Everything seemed to be going great.</p><h3> <strong>  The answer: the coach knows all about Newton&rsquo;s first law of motion. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Yes, here&rsquo;s where physics comes in play. You remember the rule: &ldquo;An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.&rdquo; The coach knows his pitcher, and even if you didn&rsquo;t, he saw something shift. The pitcher&rsquo;s arm was getting tired. Not tired enough to change the game&rsquo;s momentum, but enough that the coach saw the difference. To ensure the win, he put in a fresh pitcher with a fresh arm who could keep the runs from coming in. The coach saw that &ldquo;unbalanced force&rdquo; in play, and he know the pitcher&rsquo;s momentum was about to change&mdash;perhaps even before the man on the mound saw it coming himself.</p><p> Your job as an advisor is to do the same for your clients by managing their portfolios as carefully as a coach manages his players. Rather than building a portfolio based on your client&rsquo;s risk tolerance and then letting it stagnate (good old &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;), it&rsquo;s time to shift your own strategy by applying simple math, a bit of physics, and cloud technology to build smarter portfolios that deliver better, more sustainable performance&mdash;all while taking emotion out of the process (for you and your clients) and, ultimately, beating the robos at their own game. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p><p> Every night, current market positions are used to create charts that compare the relative strength of each asset class to create a Relative Strength Calculation using nearly 2,000 individual calculations and this simple division: the performance of a stock or ETF is divided by the performance of an index that aligns with the investment strategy, and that number is multiplied by 100. The result is the Relative Strength Calculation. And just as the coach&rsquo;s trained eye could see the pitcher&rsquo;s momentum beginning to shift downward, these calculations clearly illustrate any change in momentum for each asset class. For example, since 2011, the asset class showing the greatest upward momentum was US Equities, so it made sense to buy. But beginning this past January, US Equities began to lose strength&mdash;a shift that was clear when looking at the Relative Position Calculations. Like the coach bringing in the new pitcher, Fixed Income was waiting in the bullpen to take the #1 spot as US Equities stepped down to position #3. It&rsquo;s simple. It&rsquo;s easy. And over the past 25 years, we&rsquo;ve seen it enhance portfolio performance. Without market timing. Without emotions getting in the way. And without exceeding the portfolio thresholds set by the standard method your clients know and trust: Modern Portfolio Theory.</p><p> When our firm first started taking this approach in the late 80s, we were diligently creating 200 Relative Strength Calculation charts per week&mdash;by hand. Today, using cloud computing, we&rsquo;re able to create 7.5 million charts every night. The result is a clear, concise, and simple analysis that illustrates what assets should stay put and what should change&mdash;all based on their real-world strength and momentum relative to other assets.</p><h3> <strong>  We all know there are a lot of pitchers in the investing bullpen. </strong></h3><p> <br/> By combining simple math and the power of cloud computing to identify the relative strength and shifting momentum of each asset class, you can create portfolios that generate more income, deliver greater value to your clients, and give you the power to start winning the game all over again.</p> <p> <i>  To learn more about Smart Beta ETFs and the Dorsey Wright Relative Strength strategies, download the whitepaper </i> <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/Point_Figure?source=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <i>   Point &amp; Figure Relative Strength Signals  </i> </a> <i>  or contact </i> <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/GIG_ContactUs?source=OtherWebsite&amp;sd=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <i>   Dorsey Wright  </i> </a> <i>  .

{"original_id":5086,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"New Networking: How to Be a People Curator","link":"new-networking-how-to-be-a-people-curator","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Though social media makes it easier for us to connect, there&rsquo;s something to be said for being more human when we network.</h3><p> <br/> Social media is the handshake of our generation, but it can also be a splendid vehicle for giving warm business referrals, or just introducing two people you know have something in common.</p><p> Introductions are an important part of our society. In fact, there have been entire books written on the etiquette of introductions and how to formally introduce one person to another. However, the digital age has made the art of making introductions much easier (thank God!).</p><p> A LinkedIn article by Bridget Willard that discussed this very thing&mdash;how we find people, make introductions and build an online community. She used a phrase I&rsquo;ve toyed with in the past, that I just love and have adopted: &ldquo;Be a people curator.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s perfect because it describes exactly what we should be doing in real life, and what social allows us to do at scale: be human by sharing connections and building community.</p><p> I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of people who have been connected to me through a social media referral from a friend&mdash;it must be hundreds by now. These are people I never would have met otherwise, many of whom have joined my social tribe and become friends, even business partners. And I work hard to pay it forward, introducing people to others when I feel it would be mutually beneficial. I know that many of those introductions have resulted in a business transaction and/or an ongoing friendship, which makes me feel really good, and cements the bond I have with both parties. (My friend Raj Setty, a successful entrepreneur and amazing connector of people, evangelizes the following in his article, &ldquo; <u>  How I Learned to Make 300+ Introductions Per Year </u> .&rdquo;)</p><p> To me, this is the unsung power of social media&mdash;paying the connection forward. Not only does it increase your ability to build a community, but it also adds very real human value to both your life and the lives of your connections. That&rsquo;s also the reason I believe that individuals need to come out from behind their company brands and practice being more human on social channels. It opens up all kinds of opportunities to not only connect, but to be a relationship builder for others. Introducing people on social channels isn&rsquo;t just being nice&mdash;there&rsquo;s a benefit to you as well, and that&rsquo;s building your reputation as a person to trust. So spread the love! Introduce some folks to each other on Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook. Look for people you can connect via Pinterest or Instagram, and don&rsquo;t forget to help facilitate other connections. Follow up with them to see how it went.</p><p> We all know that real-life, face-to-face networking is a powerful tool for good, so expand it to your social channels and build community as well. Spend a little time actively looking for a few people you can connect, and make that introduction. You never know what fruit these referrals will bear down the road. Some will go nowhere while others will result in life-changing relationships, but I promise that the social karma you receive from these efforts will lead to a positive Return on Relationship.</p><p> Your brand/business is what you do; your reputation is what people remember and share. <strong>  Be a People Curator. </strong></p><p> This orginally appeared on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ted Rubin  </u> </a> .</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-04 17:44:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-04 17:44:53.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_yZtOhcK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/new-networking-how-to-be-a-people-curator/\", \"post_id\": \"10829\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-04 17:44:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-04 17:44:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"new-networking-how-to-be-a-people-curator\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10828\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5287\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/New-Networking-How-to-Be-a-People-Curator.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"417\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462600800,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

The advisor often believes he or she can &ldquo;read&rdquo; people but it is natural the advisor will not be able to get a complete and objective understanding of the client regardless of their intuition or level of experience. Uncovering these blind spots has two powerful outcomes in the financial advisory process.</p><p> Firstly, for an advisor it increases their understanding of the importance of asking clients the right questions. Getting to know how clients are financially wired is a key to building relationships. Secondly, it uncovers the need for advisors to acquire skills that assist them to understand different client communication styles and how to use that knowledge to moderate/adjust communication styles to draw out information about clients&rsquo; financial behavior and decision making patterns, and from there adapt advice to better meet their needs.</p><p> The challenge for clients is that they don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know and this leads to &lsquo;blind spots&rsquo;. They may well not be able to see opportunities in risk nor risk in opportunities, and advisors need to be able to expose these blind spots and the possible &lsquo;history&rsquo; behind them. Being able to discover their future plans, their aspirations, their background and what has driven or influenced where they want to go in terms of wealth management ensures that advisors give targeted advice that will undoubtedly build stronger client/advisor relationships.</p><p> Sarah and Michael recently engaged to be married decided to speak to a financial advisor about planning their financial future. The advisor encouraged them to save and invest; to work towards owning their own property and gave them reading material to support the advice.</p><p> Sarah and Michael left confused and dissatisfied. They had wanted to talk about handling money responsibly; they wanted to ask questions about separate or joint accounts; they wanted to start a college fund for the future education of their hoped for children; they wanted to avoid debt but use and manage credit sensibly; they wanted to ask about a self-managed pension scheme; they wanted to share their dreams for the future and how they could build wealth to enable them to realize them.</p><h3> Did the advisor give advice? Yes. Did the advisor uncover anything significant about these two &lsquo;potential&rsquo; clients? No. </h3><p> <br/> Had time been invested into asking questions, discovering their financial personality style uncovering their history, revealing any blind spots &ndash; the advisor would have discovered that Sarah&rsquo;s parents divorced after mismanagement of finances that led to bankruptcy and she was determined that this should not happen to her but knew she had many concerns about never taking any risk with finances. Michael came from a long line of financially astute family members. As a family they openly discussed finances and understood the importance of encouraging the younger members to do likewise.  Michael&rsquo;s family through careful management had built up a significant wealth.</p><p> Had the advisor been behaviorally smart; had they objectively known the different behavioral styles and emotions of these clients which comes from using a formal behavioural discovery process; had the advisor been equipped to navigate human differences by discovering and aligning how to uncover different communication styles, behaviors, solution preferences and blind spots this story would have had a happier ending.

Which means it&rsquo;s all too easy for yours to be skipped over.</p><p> Even if you don&rsquo;t have any sales experience, the actual look and feel of your resume can bring you to the top of the pool. Similarly, a stacked resume can be brought down by a couple small typos. We surveyed sales recruiters, and found that these are the seven most common mistakes that plague sales resumes.</p><h3> <strong>  The 7 Most Common Sales Resume Mistakes (And How to Fix Them) </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. You had a &ldquo;text wall&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Hiring managers often receive hundreds of applications for a single position. The average sales manager only spends  <u>  6 seconds looking at each resume </u> . If your resume is difficult to scan, it&rsquo;s hitting the shredder.</p><h3> 2. You slacked on formatting</h3><p> <br/> Format, format, format. There are literally hundreds of free templates online, here are some  <u>  <a href=\"https://resumegenius.com/resume-templates/basic-templates\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   classic formats  </a> </u>  that I love.</p><h3> 3. You didn&rsquo;t articulate your skills and accomplishments</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t undersell yourself -- especially when applying for a sales position. Your resume is the fastest, most efficient way for you to show employers why they should hire you. It is socially acceptable to brag -- in fact, it&rsquo;s encouraged.</p><p> Highlight your awards, your experience, and your accomplishments. Hiring managers are looking for your best, and if you don&rsquo;t promote yourself, they&rsquo;ll assume there&rsquo;s nothing special about you.</p><h3> 4. Your resume is (way) too long</h3><p> <br/> Keep your  <a href=\"https://www.findspark.com/ways-to-make-your-resume-one-page/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  resume to one page </a> . Period. Highlight (not literally) your key responsibilities and accomplishments for each job, then move on. As hard as it is to keep things short, the one-page resume is the new standard.</p><h3> 5. You included nonessential information</h3><p> <br/> The best resumes are short and sweet. Here are some topics that do not belong on a resume: Marital status, age, gender, astrological sign, etc. If it didn&rsquo;t pertain to your job performance, it doesn&rsquo;t need to go on your resume.</p><h3> 6. You listed outdated experience</h3><p> <br/> Only include your most recent roles that complement the role you are applying for.</p><h3> 7. You didn&rsquo;t proofread</h3><p> <br/> This seems like the most obvious mistake, but it can also be one of the most harmful to your job search. Make sure you have someone proofread your resume for typos and grammatical mistakes. In fact, have them proofread it twice!</p><h3> <strong>  Bonus Tip: Take Advantage of Job Marketplaces </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sending out resumes can become tedious and frustrating, I know. There are solutions out there that use a single resume upload to match you with hundreds of jobs.

{"original_id":5089,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Reasons Why Successful Companies Hire for Culture Fit","link":"3-reasons-why-successful-companies-hire-for-culture-fit","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether we like it or not, most of us are spending more time with our coworkers each week than with our own families. Peer relationships play a critical role in the modern workplace, something a recent  <a href=\"http://go.globoforce.com/rs/globoforce/images/Fall_2014_Mood_Tracker.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Globoforce survey </a>  examined in depth:</p><li> 95% of respondents in that survey said they&rsquo;d made at least one friend at work</li><li> 93% reported valuing the respect of their coworkers</li><li> Employees with even one friend at work are less likely to jump ship and more likely to be engaged <br/>  </li><p> Coworker friendships aren&rsquo;t just about dissecting the latest episode of Game of Thrones at the watercooler or sharing pictures of kids over email (although that&rsquo;s important too). Strong peer-to-peer relationships strengthen company loyalty, employee engagement, productivity, and overall workplace satisfaction.</p><p> But camaraderie between colleagues isn&rsquo;t created out of thin air; it&rsquo;s forged on the battlefield of everyday interactions, both professional and personal. What organizations can do is recognize the vital role that employee friendships play by fostering a work culture that promotes that camaraderie and hiring new employees who fit that culture.</p><h3> <strong>  The Psychology of Work Friendships </strong></h3><p> <br/> Human beings crave a common connection with those around us, so it&rsquo;s only natural that coworkers, who spend so much time with each other, break the barrier between acquaintances and friends. Once these friendships are established, though, the way employees work together also shifts.</p><p> In an excerpt from his book The Best Place to Work: The Art and Science of Creating an Extraordinary Workplace, social psychologist Ron Friedman uses a study conducted by management professors to illustrate this point. Researchers at the Universities of Minnesota and Pennsylvania asked a group of friends and a group of acquaintances to complete different assignments.</p><p> Friedman reports that &ldquo;friends outperformed acquaintances on both tasks&rdquo; because they &ldquo;were more committed at the start of a project, showed better communication while doing the activity, and offered teammates positive encouragement every step of the way. They also evaluated ideas more critically and gave one another feedback when they were off course.&rdquo;</p><p> In contrast, acquaintances operated in silos and only engaged each other when it was necessary, so their lack of connection held them back in how they completed the tasks.</p><p> Simply put, work friendships don&rsquo;t just make collaborating more fun or easier, but they also transform the way in which colleagues interact with each other in the process and support each other.  </p><h3> <strong>  Motivation to Go the Extra Mile </strong></h3><p> <br/> Research tells us that friends work better together, but friendship also makes a positive impact on non-collaborative work by creating an overall culture of trust and loyalty.</p><p> Christine M. Riordan, a professor of management at the University of Kentucky, writes in the  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/07/we-all-need-friends-at-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Harvard Business Review </a>  that camaraderie is &ldquo;about creating a common sense of purpose and the mentality that we are in-it together.&rdquo; This group loyalty then &ldquo;results in a shared commitment to and discipline toward the work.&rdquo;</p><p> Basically, we are more motivated to work because we don&rsquo;t want to let down our friends.</p><p> Our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/lt-2015-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Employee Engagement Report  </a> </u>  also found evidence to support this idea. Peers are the number one thing that people love about their job.</p><p> When given the chance to elaborate, employees repeatedly highlighted the hard work and dedication of their peers.</p><p> Economists, too, have long studied the positive impact of peers on worker productivity. In one study of cashiers at a supermarket chain,  <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/text20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, found </a>  that when employees saw their coworkers producing at a high level, they felt social pressure to improve their own performance.</p><p> Although workers weren&rsquo;t always motivated by altruism, these researchers concluded that &ldquo;when workers hold themselves accountable to their peers, workplaces have the potential to be cooperative environments.&rdquo;</p><p> In short, peers influence how employees perform &mdash; and friendships between coworkers take that influence to the next level, leading to improved productivity.</p><h3> <strong>  Create a Culture of Camaraderie </strong></h3><p> <br/> A positive workplace culture that encourages friendships and collaboration isn&rsquo;t a fluke that only happens because the right people happen to work at the same place. It&rsquo;s built from scratch and begins with the hiring process. Here are a few steps to take:</p><h3> Mine the Interview</h3><p> <br/> Ask questions that identify candidates who aren&rsquo;t just high performers but who can work collaboratively and engage openly with their peers.</p><h3> Hire for Attitude</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241743\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Craig Cincotta </a> , the vice president for brand development at Porch.com, contends that an employee with a great attitude &ldquo;gets people focusing on the right behaviors, which ultimately lead to better business results and overall employee satisfaction.&rdquo;</p><h3> Create a Mentorship Program</h3><p> <br/> Partner employees with each other and not just at the supervisor-employee level.  <a href=\"http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/23944_3___Peer_Coworker_Relationships.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Patricia Sias </a> , a professor of communication at Washington State University, notes that &ldquo;peer mentoring is important to an individual&rsquo;s career experience and progression.&rdquo; Mentoring shouldn&rsquo;t solely be a supervisor-subordinate relationship but one that also exists between peers on the same rung of the ladder.</p><h3> Let Employees Recognize Their Peers</h3><p> <br/> Our  <a href=\"http://www.tinyhr.com/2014-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report?__hstc=225544837.36c514e18169ec69f047da9b3df0956d.1458745471518.1462372194205.1462384770104.15&amp;__hssc=225544837.1.1462384770104&amp;__hsfp=2547014204\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2014 Employee Engagement Report </a>  found that when offered the chance, 44% of all employees will give each other recognition. Peer-to-peer recognition also works to create engaged, loyal employees who will support each other. Give employees the tools to recognize their peers for good work.</p><h3> Set Clear Expectations but Don&rsquo;t Set Boundaries</h3><p> <br/> Teams need direction and an understanding of what&rsquo;s expected of them on the job, but they may not benefit from rules that separate personal from professional.  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/104197/tenth-element-great-managing.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gallup </a>  has long studied the impact of friendship on employee engagement, concluding in a 2008 report that &ldquo;companies do far better to harness the power of this kind of social capital than to fight against it.&rdquo;</p><p> With 7 out of 10 American workers reportedly disengaged, strong bonds between colleagues could be the difference between a disengaged workforce and a highly engaged workplace. Millennials, who now make up the largest share of the workforce, are especially keen to form friendships at work, which they say makes them feel happy, motivated, and productive.</p><p> Encourage a friendly organizational culture by hiring people who will gel together, both on a personal level and in their professional dealings with each other. Your employees and your bottom line will thank you.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-04 18:05:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-04 18:05:30.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_2LX3IaS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-reasons-why-successful-companies-hire-for-culture-fit/\", \"post_id\": \"10835\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-04 18:05:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-04 18:05:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-reasons-why-successful-companies-hire-for-culture-fit\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10834\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5290\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-Reasons-Why-Successful-Companies-Hire-for-Culture-Fit.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"668\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462464000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5090,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Collaboration: The New Model for High-Net-Worth Investors?","link":"collaboration-the-new-model-for-high-net-worth-investors","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Portfolio Construction Evolved</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re seeking to grow your high-net-worth client base, I&rsquo;d like to propose a new framework for the portfolio construction process: co-creation or collaborative portfolio construction. As we embark on a post-DOL reality, this model may be the most appropriate way to ensure that investment strategies are truly in the client&rsquo;s best interest and fully support their long-term goals. The rise of outcome-oriented planning requires a comprehensive and holistic model for helping clients succeed. A collaborative and shared construction process brings together multiple perspectives and areas of expertise and can help advisors shield themselves from commoditization and compressed margins.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s take a look at the key players involved in a collaborative portfolio construction process:</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  The Client:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The client should be at the center of every investment decision. Almost half of consumers today want involvement in shaping the products and services they consume, and investments are no different. In fact, 48% of all investors are validators and have done the majority of their homework before even stepping into an advisors office.1 As such, they don&rsquo;t want you to just do it for them; they want to be an actively involved in their own destiny. We&rsquo;ve written about this transformation &mdash; and the need for personalized portfolios in a previous  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.ccmg.com/?p=1586\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Navigator Insights  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Financial Advisor:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The financial advisor understands the client most deeply and is keenly focused on their hopes and dreams as well as their strengths and weaknesses. The advisor understands the client&rsquo;s emotional reactions to risk and return and can best recommend the right path forward and direct the path over time. The financial advisor also manages the relationship with the network of specialized financial firms such as asset managers, insurers, and tax and estate professionals, helping to deliver a cohesive and personalized plan while also keeping it in balance over time.</p><h3> <strong>  Investment Manager:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the past, the investment manager would simply take a few facts and figures from the financial advisor and recommend products with the best performance. In the high-net-worth space, investment managers should, and can, add much more value. But it takes more than a risk tolerance form or proposal request. When an advisor actively involves investment managers in the planning process via a case design process, the client can better understand the powerful resources at the advisor&rsquo;s disposal. This is especially true for independent financial advisors. While they may be working alone or in small teams, they have access to a robust network of thought leadership and investment expertise and are not beholden to a single firm or investment perspective.</p><p> Collaborative portfolio construction is facilitated by a case design process, which is typically a phone appointment or in-person meeting where each party takes the time to ask questions, listen, and ultimately a portfolio custom-tailored to the client&rsquo;s needs is built. Why is this process so important for independent financial advisors who are seeking to grow their high-net-worth business?</p><li> <strong>  The client is actively involved in building their own future, and involving them shows them you care. </strong> Often the little things &mdash; circumstances that would never typically reach the investment manager&rsquo;s desk &mdash; are the most important, and they come up in the co-creation phase.</li><li> <strong>  It sets proper expectations: Every party understands their responsibility in the partnership. </strong> The case design meeting is the appropriate time to lay out expectations and responsibilities. We usethis piece to explain the relationship between client, advisor and investment managers.</li><li> <strong>  It forces the client, advisor and investment manager to communicate in ways that everyone can understand. </strong> Clients today are doing their homework and they expect to be actively involved in the decision-making process, but they may not be equipped with the jargon we use. Collaboration demands that all parties speak clearly using understandable terminology. <br/>  </li><p> As we move from a passive population, dependent on income from defined benefit and pension plans, to a population that self-funded their defined contribution plans through 401(k)s, increasingly clients are used to being actively involved in their own investments. At the iShares conference last year, BlackRock coined the phrase &ldquo; <u>  The Age of the Investor </u> &rdquo; to describe the future. A collaborative approach can help set you apart from the competition and help you develop more meaningful relationships with your clients.</p>1.

{"original_id":5091,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor About the Fiduciary Standard","link":"7-questions-to-ask-your-financial-advisor-about-the-fiduciary-standard","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The Department of Labor recently finalized a rule that requires all retirement advisors to operate under a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fiduciary standard  </a> </u> , meaning the advisors must act in their clients&rsquo; best interests when providing advice. This contrasts with the so-called suitability standard that many commission-based agents and brokers use, which merely requires them to offer &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; advice to their clients, not necessarily the best advice.</p><p> In light of this new rule, which will go into effect beginning in April 2017, we&rsquo;ve created a list of top questions to ask your retirement advisor regarding the fiduciary standard.</p><h3> 1. Do you operate with a fiduciary standard?</h3><p> <br/> Retirement advisors who are fiduciaries are required to act in your best interests without first prioritizing their own commission or their company&rsquo;s revenue. This standard is federally regulated and requires advisors to act in good faith and provide full disclosure about fees, commissions or potential conflicts of interest. Investment advice from a fiduciary won&rsquo;t be based on pressure to sell particular company products or on a desire to earn a commission. The advice a fiduciary gives will be conflict-free and never directly tied to the retirement advisor&rsquo;s personal potential to earn.</p><h3> 2. If you are a fiduciary, how long have you operated with a fiduciary standard?</h3><p> <br/> Some advisors may make a switch well before the rule goes into effect, and others will wait until the very last moment. It is important to consider an advisor&rsquo;s philosophy and mission. You may want to choose one who abides by this standard based on integrity rather than as a requirement or to avoid a negative perception.</p><h3> 3. If you recently changed to operate under the fiduciary standard, why?</h3><p> <br/> If a retirement advisor made a hasty switch in light of the recent debate generated by the rule change, you may want to do some digging. Why did she make this change? If she is afraid of being perceived negatively, this may impact your opinion of her business practices. Perform your due diligence and research reviews of the advisor, read articles about her company and ask for references. You want to ensure that you choose an advisor whom you believe in and trust.</p><h3> 4. If you are not a fiduciary, why do you think this standard is not necessary?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re considering a retirement advisor who does not operate with a fiduciary standard, you should challenge him on this issue. Ask the advisor why he doesn&rsquo;t believe the standard of always acting in clients&rsquo; best interests is the best business practice for him. You may find that such advisors are operating from a biased and selfish position.</p><h3> 5. If you are not a fiduciary, what is your fee structure?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re considering a retirement advisor who is not a fiduciary, research her  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fee structure </a>  diligently. In such a scenario, you don&rsquo;t have the implicit trust that the advisor will always act in your best interests. A complex fee arrangement could lead to myriad initial fees, back-end fees, expense ratios and potential percentage deductions on your returns.</p><h3> 6. Does being a fiduciary affect the products you offer?</h3><p> <br/> A fiduciary retirement advisor will not offer products designed to generate unnecessary or excessive fees. For example, the actively managed mutual funds that many nonfiduciaries recommend are accompanied by a sales charge when you buy and sell, which can vary from 4% to 8%. On top of that, with an actively managed fund you will also pay 1% to 2% per year in management fees. All of these fees will cut into your gains and reduce your overall return. You will find that many fiduciary retirement advisors offer less biased products, such as passively managed funds that charge a much smaller management percentage, which varies from 0.1% to 0.2%.</p><h3> 7. How does the fiduciary standard affect your relationship with your clients?</h3><p> <br/> Your retirement advisor&rsquo;s relationship with his clients is an important topic to explore. Clients know that fiduciary advisors hold themselves to strict federal guidelines in all of the decisions they make. This helps build trusting business relationships with clients.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-04 18:27:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-04 18:27:11.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Zoi8BBN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-questions-to-ask-your-financial-advisor-about-the-fiduciary-standard/\", \"post_id\": \"10838\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-04 18:27:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-04 18:27:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-questions-to-ask-your-financial-advisor-about-the-fiduciary-standard\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10839\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5292\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/7-Questions-to-Ask-Your-Financial-Advisor-About-the-Fiduciary-Standard.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462446000,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

It is that one journey that enables you to achieve your important goals in life. However, we all tend to make career decisions that are short-term and according to what our emotions dictate. What you may not realize is that the small or trivial decision you make right now can have huge effects on your career path in the long run.</p><p> The following are common career mistakes you should avoid so that you won't regret in the future:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Using money instead of job satisfaction as basis for choosing a career. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It's a huge mistake to measure your success based on how much money you can make, because money isn't everything. You spend a lot of time at work, so it's necessary that you love and enjoy what you do. You should choose a career that matches your passions and skills. It's vital that you look at the bigger picture and not just focus on how you are compensated at your job right now.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Avoiding career challenges and being afraid to make mistakes. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Another thing you should not do is avoid challenges. Of course challenges are not easy to deal with. They make you nervous and even lose your self confidence. But it is only through overcoming challenges that you can actually grow professionally and even personally. Making mistakes is also not something you can avoid. We all make mistakes, and you should learn from those mistakes.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Choosing not to invest in yourself. </strong></h3><p> <br/> At the end of the day, you are the one who controls your career. You are the only one who's accountable for your success or failure in your career. Thus, you must make it a point to enhance your knowledge and skills even it means spending your money for training. You shouldn't think of this as a waste of your time and money because self development is one of the most important investments you will ever make in your life.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Waiting for opportunities to come to you. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The workplace we have today is too competitive, and so you need to be proactive in getting what you want. You can't just sit there and wait for opportunities to come knocking at your door. If you want to get something, then you have to do something to get it. You need to be assertive so you can be in total control of your career.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Refusing to have a mentor. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Mentors and coaches are everywhere. They can help you learn things that you may not otherwise learn from your job itself.

{"original_id":5093,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Know These 6 Customer Experience Performance Domains?","link":"do-you-know-these-6-customer-experience-performance-domains","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The Customer Experience Professionals Association (CXPA) was established in 2011 to support and to advance the customer experience profession, to set standards for the profession, and to increase the visibility of these long-unsung heroes. I've been a member since 2012. I'm actively involved in the association in a variety of capacities, including as an executive officer of the Board of Directors.  <br/> <br/> The success of the Association rides on its members. Volunteering for event planning committees, mentoring fellow members, or participating in the community forum are only a few examples of how members can drive member engagement and overall association success. The voice of the member is heard and incorporated into all we do. We try to practice what we preach, so to speak.  <br/> <br/> The value that the CXPA offers resides in both education and networking. Quite frankly, the two go hand in hand. Again, the association is member-driven. Members work together to share, discuss, and learn with/from others who are experiencing the same challenges in their professional roles. Through events, webinars, member calls, community forums, mentor-mentee relationships, and experts, there's no shortage of opportunities to learn from peers. <br/> <br/> Two years ago, the Association launched its own certification program, the CCXP, i.e., Certified Customer Experience Professional. The certification was likened to the bar exam for lawyers, giving validation that customer experience professionals have earned their stripes by completing a rigorous exam about the fundamentals of customer experience, or, as the Association refers to them: the customer experience performance domains. There are six domains that comprise the certification exam and, quite frankly, encompass what we as customer experience professionals do, talk about, and fight for day in and day out in our roles as customer experience transformists.  <br/> <br/> The following is an overview of the six domains.</p><h3> 1. Customer-Centric Culture</h3><p> <br/> A customer-centric culture is one that encourages employees to focus on the customer. It begins with executives who are committed to the cause and talk about the customer and the customer experience before sales and acquisition. The customer's voice is incorporated into all business decisions, i.e., how will [product, service, change, decision, etc.] this impact the customer and his experience?  <br/> <br/> Employees understand how they impact the customer experience, and they have a clear line of sight to the customer. They are trained continuously on what delivering a great customer experience means for the organization. Best practices and customer stories are shared regularly with employees.</p><h3> 2. Voice of the Customer, Customer Insight, and Understanding</h3><p> <br/> Critical to transforming the customer experience is understanding the customer, his journey, and how well you're performing on,  or how easy it is for the customer to complete, the journey. I always say, you can't transform something you don't understand.  <br/> <br/> In order to understand, you'll need to listen, characterize, and empathize. Listening to the voice of the customer (and, really, the voice of all of your constituencies) will help you learn about customers' expectations and how well you're performing against them. Analyze the feedback and use it to make improvements. Research your customers, identify the jobs they are trying to do, and develop personas to help the organization understand who your customers are. And map their journeys; walk in your customers shoes to truly understand the current state of the experience and the effort involved in completing some task with your organization.</p><h3> 3. Organizational Adoption and Accountability</h3><p> <br/> Without commitment from the entire organization, a customer experience transformation is not possible. Employees drive the experience; they deliver the experience. So we need to make sure they're on board with the things they'll be expected to do. All of those \"things\" must align with business goals and desired outcomes. <br/> <br/> Develop programs and initiatives with employees rather than forcing change on them. And whatever they're expected to do, give them ownership. Set them free to do what they know they need to do for the customer. Empower them, but hold them accountable. Provide feedback and help them stay on the right course, if needed.</p><h3> 4. Customer Experience Strategy</h3><p> <br/> A customer experience strategy outlines how the organization will execute on the customer experience vision. The strategy helps you define, design, and, ultimately, deliver the desired customer experience (desired, of course, by your customers). Strategy is mainly about the how, but your CX strategy may also include details about the who, what, when, and the how much of experience design and helps everyone focus on those activities or improvements that will be most impactful to your customers. (It gets everyone on the same page, marching to the same beat.) It should be aligned with your corporate strategy.</p><h3> 5. Experience Design, Improvement, and Innovation</h3><p> <br/> We can't do all of this work and not make improvements to the experience! This domain is where the rubber meets the road. You'll take what you learned during listening and journey mapping and redesign the experience to meet your customers' needs. Design thinking and customer co-creation sessions are often used to solidify the customer's voice and place in this transformation. This domain also includes incorporating continuous improvement processes into your strategy to ensure that improvements aren't viewed as \"one and done.\" Customers evolve. Needs change. Your business changes and grows. These factors must all be taken into account as you undertake any customer experience improvement efforts.</p><h3> 6. Metrics, Measurement, and ROI</h3><p> <br/> You can't manage what you don't measure. You can't track success without identifying metrics that define and measure it. Be thoughtful in your selection of the metrics, and don't rush to tie them to employee compensation. <br/> <br/> Important to this domain is the ever-elusive, yet oft-sought-after, ROI of customer experience. And rightly so. But ROI is important to understanding and measuring success, not just for building the case for doing something. If, in the end, we make these improvements, and there are no benefits, financial or otherwise, then the effort was wasted. No executive wants to (or will) support that. <br/> <br/> If this all sounds like a lot of work, it is; it's hard work. Transforming the customer experience takes baby steps. And persistence. Unfortunately, a lot of companies are still failing at the basics (they might be listening to customers, but they aren't acting on the feedback, for example), never mind attempting to build on all six domains, and it's the reason you feel the pain when you interact with these companies. <br/> <br/> Good luck in your endeavors! I wish you much success.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-04 20:37:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-04 20:37:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_2g7blVp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-know-these-6-customer-experience-performance-domains/\", \"post_id\": \"10842\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-04 20:37:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-04 20:37:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-know-these-6-customer-experience-performance-domains\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10840\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5294\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Every-Decision-You-Make-Has-Huge-Effects-on-Your-Career-Path-5-Turns-to-Avoid.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"590\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462474800,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5094,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Types of People You Should Be Engaging on Social Media (but Probably Aren't)","link":"10-types-of-people-you-should-be-engaging-on-social-media-but-probably-arent","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We need to engage with our customers on social media. Got it.  </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t worry: this list is about so much more. Beyond your customers, there are nine other relationships you need to engage on social media to really optimize your presence there.</p><p> This list came from our recent interview with Kyra Reed, Co-Founder of Made to Order Agency. Here are the 10 relationships you need to engage on social media.</p><h3> 1) Customers</h3><p> <br/> Engaging with your customers is a given. Duh.</p><h3> 2) Employees</h3><p> <br/> After customers, the number one group to engage is your own employees. They are the closest to your brand and your biggest advocates.</p><p> Over half of millennials say that if their company is engaging them on social media (and incentivizing them to communicate about the company), they&rsquo;re likely to stay at that company.</p><p> Also, anyone you&rsquo;re going to want to hire now will have a LinkedIn, and they willcheck you out. How will they expect to be treated, if hired?</p><p> Companies like IBM do an incredible job with this internally and externally. Sandy Carter is in charge of all social for IBM, which has a lot of programs that incentivize employees toward employee advocacy.</p><p> There aren&rsquo;t enough companies doing this well, but it&rsquo;s catching on. Employee advocacy is a buzzword this year.</p><h3> 3) Vendors</h3><p> <br/> You might look at social media as a space to interact with customers, but your vendors are on there as well.</p><p> If you work with someone on a regular basis, thank them on social. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to be called out publicly for doing a great job? Who wouldn&rsquo;t want a public recommendation? It helps to make that relationship even more solid.</p><p> There&rsquo;s something else, too. Most people who participate in social media are voyeurs: they watch and make their judgement about you not based on their interaction with you but on how you deal with the people and brands around you.</p><p> When you publicly acknowledge another brand at no benefit to you, people see that&mdash;and it speaks volumes.</p><h3> 4) Neighbors</h3><p> <br/> Your neighbors aren&rsquo;t always your competition, especially if you have a brick-and-mortar storefront.</p><p> Kyra worked with the Sunset Strip in California years ago. At that point, no one wanted to go there, so the businesses got together with their neighbors and shared each other&rsquo;s tweets, put on shared events, and worked together as a community. In the past, they fought over every dollar that came to the strip; now, they were looking at how to divide that dollar among themselves and keep people coming back and bringing their friends.</p><p> This shift in your mentality can really change an entire community and business district. Do whatever you can do to create a unified message with neighbor businesses.</p><h3> 5) Sponsors/Partners</h3><p> <br/> This is more common: if somebody wants to do an event with you, they&rsquo;re going to look at how you use your social media. They&rsquo;ll ask for tweets, promotions, that sort of thing.</p><p> But beyond that, there is a full relationship you can have with that sponsor. Share information that isn&rsquo;t about the event you&rsquo;re doing. That way the public sees that you care about more than obligatory promotion.</p><h3> 6) Competition</h3><p> <br/> This is a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow, but if you can bring yourself to do it, it can pay dividends. Remember Kyra&rsquo;s Sunset Strip example, how competing businesses banded together.</p><p> Or here&rsquo;s a more recent example: Burger King reached out to McDonald&rsquo;s for World Peace Day, suggesting they make a burger together, sell it, and raise money for charity. McDonald&rsquo;s turned their nose up at it, but seven other burger chains clamored to join BK.</p><p> Who do you think got the great press? Burger King. And McDonald&rsquo;s took a hit, looking like jerks.</p><p> A sense of community changes the way the public views you.</p><h3> 7) Influencers</h3><p> <br/> Influencers are people who have a lot of sway. They have either a huge following or substantial power online.</p><p> If they&rsquo;re an influencer in your field, you want a relationship with them. And the best way to get that is through social.</p><h3> 8) Community Leaders</h3><p> <br/> A community leader may or may not have a lot of influence, but they&rsquo;re very mission-driven.</p><p> For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a podcaster, and the issues important to you are FCC rulings around communication and internet accessibility. If things were to change in that area, you&rsquo;d be severely affected. Community leaders are the lawyers, authors, etc. who may not be interested creating influence, but want to make a difference in areas that impact others.</p><p> You need to know who those people are and make sure things stay safe in your industry by forming a relationship with them. If you&rsquo;re doing an authentic job, you&rsquo;ll share a bit of their spotlight as well.</p><h3> 9) Journalists/Bloggers</h3><p> <br/> Journalists and bloggers may also not have much influence, but they can help you with a variety of things: SEO, press releases, etc.</p><p> And they always need stories and content. The best thing to do is find the ones you like and follow them. Read their previous stories and suggest new ones based on those topics.</p><h3> 10) Other Companies</h3><p> <br/> These are companies that don&rsquo;t fall under vendors, competition, or neighbors. You may want to join up in various capacities with other companies. An association with your brand might be a great thing, depending on what you do.</p><p> And engaging content is hard to produce all the time; sometimes you can lean on other relationships to help you turn out content. There&rsquo;s no money changing hands, no contractual obligation, but it&rsquo;s a good relationship for all involved.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> The biggest mistake that people make with social media is thinking that Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are marketing platforms. They&rsquo;re not. They weren&rsquo;t built for marketing: they&rsquo;re relationship platforms that you can market on.</p><p> And as we&rsquo;ve seen, there are many relationships to form beyond your obvious customer base.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll need to take advantage of many of them to have a complete online presence for your brand.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-04 20:43:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-04 20:43:00.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_HfTKUhP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-types-of-people-you-should-be-engaging-on-social-media-but-probably-arent/\", \"post_id\": \"10844\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-04 20:43:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-04 20:43:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-types-of-people-you-should-be-engaging-on-social-media-but-probably-arent\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10843\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5295\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/10-Types-of-People-You-Should-Be-Engaging-on-Social-Media-but-Probably-Arent.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"601\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462449600,"author_id":208,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5095,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ever Wondered Why Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama Routinely Wear the Same Clothes?","link":"ever-wondered-why-mark-zuckerberg-and-barack-obama-routinely-wear-the-same-clothes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of the most common side effects of our lives in a demanding society is the habit of living on auto-pilot. More often than not, we find ourselves being overly influenced by media platforms, social media, political, and bureaucratic forces.  We unwittingly conform to the masses and end up being unaware of who is actually controlling our life.  As social creatures, we have the disposition of becoming one of the crowd, and running on auto-pilot.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t you want to be in the driver&rsquo;s seat of your own life?</p><p> Being on auto-pilot means to allow yourself to be led by the outside influences in life like a cork floating upon a stream, being shifted and pulled by the whim of the running water. </p><p> It is important when striving to live a good life that we are aware of our ability to choose and exercise our choice rather than settle for the default option. The default setting is usually designed to cater to our need for convenience or laziness. Being aware of choice is also synonymous with being conscious. Reflecting on the standards that are a major part of our life and discerning their values. To switch out of auto-pilot is to think critically and to place the influences from the outside forces into perspective. We are able to regain a sense of awareness and to steer ourselves from going through life only by the routine motions usually set by others for their advantage.</p><p> On the other hand, having to take an impression from everything at every moment of the day could easily result in becoming overwhelmed, drained and burnt out. Therefore, we could utilize an Auto-Choice&trade; to better utilize our resources and time. An Auto-choice is the conscious process of deliberating options, exercising a decision and then relegating it to become automatic. It can be seen as a healthy habit, where as being on auto-pilot could allow ourselves to settle into an unhealthy habit.</p><p> This is as well why Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and even President Obama routinely wore, or wear, the same clothes on a consistent basis. It is an auto-choice not to waste time worrying about what to wear, and in effect not stressing about another decision. They are choosing not to engage in the aspects of life that dictate a lot of our time and weaken our effectiveness. Deciding what food, clothes, and route to take to work can use up a lot of unnecessary time.</p><p> When I go to a restaurant that I have been to before for an important meeting, I choose what to order beforehand. This enables me to keep my complete focus on the conversation.  It is an auto-choice and a more resourceful method of utilizing my time. I have elected to free my time from the static of the menu and the restaurant and chosen to engage my attention fully to what&rsquo;s being discussed. This has proven beneficial all involved and has usually lead to great outcomes.</p><p> By being present and aware, we can usually combat the disease of living in auto-pilot. The mindful choice to discern what is more important, and to not be piloted by the force of outside influences.  When we choose to switch out of auto-pilot, we can start using our time more wisely and lead a more successful and fulfilled life.  Investing the attention to make choices and relegating some to auto-choice it a great way to live a powerful life.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-04 21:07:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-04 21:07:23.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Lsutpzd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ever-wondered-why-mark-zuckerberg-and-barack-obama-routinely-wear-the-same-clothes/\", \"post_id\": \"10846\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-04 21:07:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-04 21:07:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ever-wondered-why-mark-zuckerberg-and-barack-obama-routinely-wear-the-same-clothes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10845\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5296\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ever-Wondered-Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-and-Barack-Obama-Routinely-Wear-the-Same-Clothes.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1132\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462467600,"author_id":285,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5096,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why CMO and Marketing Agency Partnerships Are Necessary to Compete in 2016","link":"why-cmo-and-marketing-agency-partnerships-are-necessary-to-compete-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Here&rsquo;s the trouble with many marketing agencies, according to Chief Marketing Officers. They talk a fine game, list prestigious brands they&rsquo;ve worked for and emphasize their creative endeavors&hellip; but they miss what really matters to their prospective partners.</h3><p> <br/> At its core, the CMO/marketing agency partnership is really about relationship building and connecting as business-minded people. It&rsquo;s about how an agency can add value to a business by providing hard numbers, facts, customer insights and marketing growth opportunities.</p><p> It&rsquo;s about intelligent discussions about tackling the challenges ahead with new solutions and technology. There are many agencies out there that completely miss the mark for their clients, but nothing beats finding that sweet spot of collaboration with the right partnership.</p><p> What follows is a discussion of the strengths of a CMO/marketing agency pairing, the trouble of working with the wrong partner, and how to outsource some of your marketing tasks to a firm that truly understands your business model.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the cold, hard truth: most marketing departments are stretched way too thin. It often takes a lot of work for CMOs to justify marketing expenditures to Corporate, let alone convince them that the hassle and expense of adding necessary personnel to an existing team is worthwhile. An agency partnership can not only save a ridiculous amount of money (we once estimated we save our clients a good $337,000 a year or more), but also circumvents issues like retention, learning curve, training, managing additional staff and benefits packages.</p><p> Kissmetrics wisely speculates that major brands will seek to capitalize on the advantages of partnerships, going one step further and buying media companies to fulfill their marketing needs. Content houses and technology providers may find offers on the table from clients with money who want to make a high-profile acquisition of their companies. Furthermore, brands will be looking for YouTube celebrities and high-profile influencers to partner with so they can tap established networks of prospective buyers.</p><p> CMOs excel at managing campaigns, but agencies offer &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; perspective.  Tunnel-vision happens to the best of us. A modern marketing firm is adept at spreading consistent messages across all platforms, identifying areas of strength and weakness by looking at the data and finding ways to help CMOs justify the budget with ROI numbers. As CMO.com put it: &ldquo;Marketers are more reliant on their agencies and other outsourced partners to help them succeed in a business landscape that has become far more complicated, as well as highly technology- and data-driven.&rdquo; Successful digital marketing requires cohesive storytelling (including corporate-shared narratives and customer experiences shared socially) and cross-platform communication that builds and sustains relationships between businesses and the people they serve. The big picture can be complex and easy to lose sight of without many minds mulling over the data and making intelligent decisions on how to tweak campaigns, messages or imagery to better connect the dots between opportunity and sales. Agencies with decades of experience working with different clients can identify common themes that breed exceptionalism in marketing and bring business savvy to the table that internal personnel limited to one brand experience doesn&rsquo;t always possess.</p><p> The best agencies specialize and make it their business to eat, sleep and breathe the freshest industry news. Within a company, you&rsquo;re likely focused on the daily grind, corporate news and overseeing existing campaigns. You&rsquo;re likely receiving data and updating your strategy as you go &mdash; to some extent. What CMO honestly has time to scour the headlines for every relevant news story related to dozens of niche marketing topics? Google&rsquo;s got a new algorithm; there&rsquo;s a new knock-out tool that makes content curation more effective; Twitter is offering new features to their paid advertising platform; this new technology is converting more sales than anything you&rsquo;ve seen before. CMOs rely on agency partners to sort through the clutter and bring the most relevant news to the table. They bring the spice to the soup that will turn a bland, stale strategy into a growth engine for the future.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Want-CMOs-Want.png\" width=\"706\"/></p><h3> <strong>  It&rsquo;s All About Finding The RIGHT Partnership </strong></h3><p> <br/> So a lot of what we&rsquo;ve been talking about thus so far is the ideal case scenario. You found an agency you love and they love you back. Communication is excellent and all parties are thriving together. Unfortunately, this type of CMO/agency relationship is more the exception than the rule. One survey found that  <a href=\"http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/255033/cmos-want-better-data-expertise.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  only 5% of respondents </a>  (who spend more than $10 million on media per year) said they were confident in their agency partner&rsquo;s performance.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Biggest-Deficiency-Among-Marketing-Agencies.jpg\" width=\"650\"/></p><p> he problems cited are many, especially since the role of agencies has been largely shifting from providing creative functions to providing more data-driven solutions within the last five years. Last year&rsquo;s Client/Agency Relationship survey conducted by Forbes found that issues included:</p><li> Poorly trained personnel</li><li> Inability to come up with genuine consumer insights</li><li> Insufficient knowledge of the issues that impact client business</li><li> Lack of integration between online and offline marketing solutions</li><li> Under-staffing, turnover and inexperienced junior associates working on accounts</li><li> Struggles to evolve digital marketing capabilities based on new trends <br/>  </li><p> Not surprisingly, a whopping 81% of companies favor working with more than one agency (whom they consider &ldquo;vendors&rdquo; more than partners). You may be hesitant to put all your eggs in one basket, but asking a few questions before partnering up can go a long way in finding the right agency.</p><h3> <strong>  Ask The Tough Questions Before Making Your Decision </strong></h3><p> <br/> A few questions can help you gauge an agency&rsquo;s fit early on:</p><li> Who will we be working with and what do you need from us? Ideally, the CMO (or another designated point person) will work directly with the company founder or agency CEO on the account. One source of frustration for many CMOs comes in seeing the people who landed their account leave the agency, putting inexperienced people in charge. High turnover for your account spells disaster for the consistency of your marketing strategy and messages. Find out how long staff has been working for the agency to gauge the firm&rsquo;s stability.</li><li> What scope of work can you provide? Multinational companies may require the expertise of multinational agencies. Medium and smaller budget firms may need a boutique agency that can deliver the precise services needed, without having to pay for extra fluff and filler that may be included with the bigger agency packages.</li><li> Is it possible to do a trial run? Before committing long-term, seeing how an agency runs a particular campaign or project can help you see precisely how they work. Assess their quality and level of communication to ensure it&rsquo;s to your liking. Ask which benchmarks and KPIs are measured. Look at reports they furnish to you and consider how these documents might function at your next meeting with Corporate. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Find Your Perfect Match </strong></h3><p> <br/> We still believe CMOs can find everything they need with one agency, but it requires honest communication and feeling each other out before any work begins. Over time, we&rsquo;ve identified common threads of our most fruitful partnerships and determined which industries are truly our forte. We don&rsquo;t take every client that comes our way. There is a lot more to life than landing a big account or making a lot of money. We want to enjoy coming to work each day and work for brands that we are passionate about and brands we know we can help.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-04 21:17:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-04 21:17:30.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_AiphlIC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-cmo-and-marketing-agency-partnerships-are-necessary-to-compete-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"10850\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-04 21:17:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-04 21:17:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-cmo-and-marketing-agency-partnerships-are-necessary-to-compete-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10847\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5297\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-CMO-and-Marketing-Agency-Partnerships-Are-Necessary-to-Compete-in-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"666\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462456800,"author_id":316,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5097,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want to Stand out from the Crowd? Follow These 10 Specific Nuances","link":"want-to-stand-out-from-the-crowd-follow-these-10-specific-nuances","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Here are some tips to remind you of some specific nuances, some of the many little things, we gently suggest you consider, to help you be more aware of How to Stand Apart&trade; to better compete: </p><h3> 1. ENERGY</h3><p> <br/> If we think about it, we all have the gift of feeling the energy around us.  As soon as you walk into a room, one is able to feel and sense the energy in the room.  Make a conscious effort to tune-in your finely tuned sensory receptors, to feel the room's energy and respond, accordingly.  Here, you have an opportunity ..  to respond and set the tone.     </p><h3> 2. INITIATE</h3><p> <br/> Successful people initiate.  Be the person who initiates everything from the first handshake to making eye-contact and conversation.  Ask open-ended questions about the other person and use their name, often.  I just brought a guest to The Capital Grille, a restaurant known for Power meals.  I always notice those who come into these restaurants who greet and shake hands and introduce themselves to everyone at their table including the host and maitre d&rsquo; and, use names.  Practice initiating consistently &ndash; socially and in business until this become part of you and your Personal Style! ~ You will be remembered as the initiator &ndash; as the person who leads, who others follow.  Initiate warm greetings and set your Professional tone and tenor &ndash; all, a positive, powerful reflection of you while demonstrating respect toward others.  </p><h3> 3. SHAKE HANDS</h3><p> <br/> Shake hands like you mean it, like you want to be remembered in all positive ways which includes:   </p><li> Standing while initiating the handshake upon meeting, greeting, saying farewell and, sealing a bargain.  Remember the &ldquo;half-stand&rdquo; in awkward situations &ndash; tres chic.</li><li> Making good eye-contact - remember the lingering eye &ndash; an extra 2-3 seconds, not 9 or 10</li><li> Check your posture - stand straight and tall (Professional Stance); hands at sides, chin parallel to floor; lift rib cage</li><li> Have a pleasant, approachable expression on your face</li><li> Voice check:  take the edge off your voice</li><li> Have a &ldquo;tag line&rdquo; prepared which may change, from venue to venue. <br/>  </li><h3> 4. CONVERSATION </h3><p> <br/> Initiate conversation by asking open-ended questions about the other person which accomplishes three things:</p><li> Keeps you in the &ldquo;initiator&rdquo; position.</li><li> Takes the onus off you to talk.</li><li> Permits you to hear volumes of powerful information from listening to the sound of another persons&rsquo; voice.  Voice is a powerful medium.  You can hear use of grammar, words they use, you can hear nervousness, boredom, arrogance, confidence! Use this to your advantage. <br/>  </li><h3> 5. LISTEN</h3><p> <br/> The most potent talent of a leader who exudes Professional Presence is to listen.  Be an Active Listener and listen with your ears, eyes and, body language.  Focus everything &ndash; all your attention, on THEM.  Endeavor to listen for more than what is just being &ldquo;said.&rdquo;</p><h3> 6. SPEECH</h3><p> <br/> When speaking: Remember, you have about three seconds to &lsquo;trade or travel.&rsquo;  Make your words count.  Make it about them and let them understand what&rsquo;s in it for them.   </p><li> Eliminate the non-words</li><li> Say what you mean and mean what you say</li><li> Pausing, shows you are a thoughtful person</li><li> Be careful with eyes and perceptions:  looking up suggests &ldquo;Heaven help me;&rdquo; sideways suggests &ldquo;shifty.&rdquo;  Looking down and pausing, shows you are a thoughtful person &ndash; make eye-contact; complete the thought. <br/>  </li><h3> 7. REMEMBERING NAMES and Using them!</h3><p> <br/> Make a point of remembering names and use them, often.</p><h3> 8. SINCERITY</h3><p> <br/> Emanate warmth and sincerity.  If you do not, others people will read this and there will be a disconnect.  Treat everyone you meet including the valet who pulls up your car and, the senior executive whom you just met with the same respect.  Make strangers feel like you have known them forever. </p><h3> 9.  APPROACH</h3><p> <br/> Vertically (Professional Stance)</p><h3> 10. LISTEN</h3><p> <br/> Step forward, lean in, turn sideways (unconfrontational). For those blessed with the great gift of height: bend at the waist and, even your knees;  lower your head slightly.  People of height need to be aware of and sensitive to eight and the intimidation factor, however inadvertently being conveyed and, mis-perceptions of &ldquo;talking down&rdquo; to people.  </p><p> If you do all these things, you will indeed &ldquo;be a Man/woman well-met.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 15:21:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 15:21:00.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_XTd8VKr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-to-stand-out-from-the-crowd-follow-these-10-specific-nuances/\", \"post_id\": \"10852\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 15:21:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 15:21:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-to-stand-out-from-the-crowd-follow-these-10-specific-nuances\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10851\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5299\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Want-to-Stand-out-from-the-Crowd-Follow-These-10-Specific-Nuances.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"632\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462546800,"author_id":254,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5098,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What 60% of Americans Have in Common With Prince","link":"what-60-of-americans-have-in-common-with-prince","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Everybody I talk to seems to have a Prince story&hellip;except me. I couldn&rsquo;t identify &ldquo;Purple Rain&rdquo; even from a video of  <u>  Prince performing his most recognized hit </u> . Maybe his style or culture didn&rsquo;t mesh with mine. My taste in music runs more toward John Denver, as I&rsquo;ve written before. I suppose Prince and I just didn&rsquo;t have much in common.</p><h3> Sadly, there is something Prince had in common with over 60% of Americans and 55% of Americans with children&mdash;regardless of their age or musical preferences.</h3><p> <br/> He left a legacy of music, but he died without a Will. It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine that a man with such wealth and a deep commitment to supporting charities had done no planning to transfer his assets. Prince had no spouse and no children, so his fortune will likely be divided among his sister and half-siblings, and they&rsquo;re already in disputes about how his non-monetary assets should be handled. It&rsquo;s complicated, but perhaps less devastating than when someone like you or me dies without a Will.</p><p> Prince&rsquo;s heirs will be dividing up a valuable guitar collection, a vault of unpublished music, and more. But for people who leave behind $300K, $500K, or $1M dollars, their heirs often need this money to live without a parent, caretaker, or financial provider. For families with children, the situation is even more challenging&mdash;especially if both parents die at the same time, leaving behind a legal mess in which the children can suffer the most. According to a 2015 survey from  <a href=\"https://www.caring.com/about/news-room/american-parents-wills\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Caring.com </a> , just over half of parents have a Will. Among those who do, 60 percent haven't updated it within the last five years. Another  <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/money-pulse-0715.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  survey </a>  revealed that more than a third of parents with kids younger than 18 don't have life insurance, and even if they do, more than half have less than $100,000 in coverage&mdash;which isn&rsquo;t enough to cover future expenses like paying off the mortgage or funding the kids' college education.</p><h3> Why do so few people take care of this very basic and important task?</h3><p> <br/> Most people without a Will say they just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to making one. Or maybe we&rsquo;re simply too uncomfortable confronting our own mortality. But are these valid reasons&hellip;or just excuses?</p><p> Years ago I received a call from an estate attorney whose client was the mother of a 6-year old boy named Brad. Brad&rsquo;s parents divorced before his father died, leaving Brad a life insurance policy of $500,000. The problem was that there was no Will creating a Trust for Brad, so the proceeds couldn&rsquo;t be paid out without the supervision of the probate court. Every time Brad&rsquo;s mother needed money for summer camp or music lessons, her attorney had to petition the court and pay $500 in fees to get a $1,000 distribution. It was a mess. The estate attorney asked if I would serve as a co-trustee with Brad&rsquo;s mother so the court could be petitioned to release Brad&rsquo;s inheritance from the Probate Court&rsquo;s costly supervision. It worked, but it cost the Trust $50,000 in court and legal fees over a 5-year period before it was clear sailing. If Brad&rsquo;s father had made a Will in the first place, Brad would have had about $50K more in his Trust to pay for everything from music lessons to college. What a waste.</p><p> Death comes to all of us at one time or another, and an early, unexpected death can result in costly and complicated legal actions when a Will is outdated and circumstances have changed&mdash;or there has been no Estate Planning at all. Take a lesson from Prince and make this Estate Planning checklist part of your plan for the next month. Pay homage to yourself and your loved ones. Just do it:</p><li> <strong>  If you don&rsquo;t have a Will, write one by Memorial Day.  </strong> Protect your loved ones and write a Will. If your situation isn't too complicated, you can even do your own with software like  <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Ecommerce+-+Quicken+WillMaker&amp;utm_term=WillMaker+-+e&amp;utm_content=s8zeOoad4_dc%7Cpcrid%7C60357949690%7Cpkw%7Cwillmaker%7Cpmt%7Ce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  WillMaker </a> . At least it&rsquo;s a start.</li><li> <strong>  If you have a Will, review your documents every 3-5 years. </strong>  If the legal language isn&rsquo;t clear to you, get some help. Be sure your Will clearly states who your fiduciaries are and which of your beneficiaries will receive what. If you moved from the state in which your Will was executed, it must be updated.</li><li> <strong>  Pay attention to the Personal Property Memorandum. </strong>   All Wills include a reference to this memorandum, but 90% of these are blank. Fill yours out. Make your wishes clear.</li><li> <strong>  Verify your beneficiaries on other legal documents. </strong>  The beneficiaries included on your IRAs, life insurance policies, and 401(k) accounts supersede those listed in your Will, so be sure they are accurate and not contradictory to your wishes.</li><li> <strong>  Make sure your Power of Attorney (POA) and Health Care Directive are up to date. </strong> If your health care POA is over 7 years old, it probably needs to be updated. Even if you have a Will in place, writing down end-of-life decisions can make all the difference for family members and other loved ones&mdash;no matter what your age.

{"original_id":5099,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Surprising Stats Revealed in Report on Financial Literacy and Retirement Planning","link":"surprising-stats-revealed-in-report-on-financial-literacy-and-retirement-planning","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In March 2016, Statistics Canada released a report call Insights on Canadian Society: Financial literacy and retirement planning. The report highlights a strong connection between financial literacy and retirement planning.</p><p> Most marketing and communications professionals in the financial services industry have long known these two concepts are closely related. </p><p> But the report still holds a few surprises. For one thing, the audience you&rsquo;re writing for likely has less financial knowledge than you expect, which will affect the way you communicate with them. How can you modify your communications efforts for an audience that doesn&rsquo;t have the level of financial literacy you thought it would?</p><h3> The study</h3><p> <br/> The Statistics Canada report is based on the 2014 Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS). Respondents of that survey were given a financial literacy quiz made up of 14 questions. They were then given a score based on their answers to the quiz.</p><p> After accounting for demographic factors, such as level of education, age and income, those with higher financial literacy scores were more likely to financially prepare for retirement and to know how much they needed to save for retirement than those with lower scores.</p><p> That&rsquo;s the good news. The not-so-good news is that, across demographic factors, the average financially literacy score for those who were preparing for retirement was only 9.4 out of 14 (or 67%), and only 7.6 (or 54%) for those who weren&rsquo;t preparing for retirement.</p><p> Overall, only 45% of respondents across demographic factors knew how much they needed to save for retirement. That&rsquo;s not a high level of financial literacy for any group of Canadians.</p><h3> How well do you know your audience?</h3><p> <br/> The first rule of communications is &ldquo;know your audience.&rdquo; For example, when you&rsquo;re writing for a broad audience with a range of financial literacy levels, you know to keep your writing simple, clear and concise. You take steps to make sure every member of your audience understands what you&rsquo;re writing about and that your message doesn&rsquo;t get lost.</p><p> But what happens when you think you&rsquo;re writing for a more sophisticated audience of, for example, highly educated or senior-level non-financial professionals? Many communicators would take their writing up a level. They&rsquo;ll use more sophisticated language, explain fewer concepts and make sure they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;talking down&rdquo; to anyone.</p><p> Well, not so fast &hellip; you might not know your audience as well as you think you do.</p><p> The 2014 CFCS shows that being highly educated doesn&rsquo;t always mean a high level of financial literacy, nor does hailing from any particular profession, financial or otherwise.</p><p> Although having a university degree was associated with slightly higher financial literacy scores (9.9), that&rsquo;s still a score of just over 70%, meaning there are a lot of university-degree holders who don&rsquo;t know very much about finance and investing. In fact, only 53% of university degree holders knew how much they needed to save for retirement.</p><p> In terms of professions, those in &ldquo;management&rdquo; had slightly higher financial literacy scores, with 61% knowing how much they need to save for retirement. All other professions scored significantly lower, with just under 50% of business and finance professionals knowing how much they needed to save for retirement.</p><h3> Aim for inclusivity</h3><p> <br/> What&rsquo;s the takeaway here? No matter who you think your audience is, take an inclusive communications approach by assuming that not everyone you&rsquo;re writing for will have the same level of financial literacy. Some members of your audience may have a high level of financial literacy, while there are plenty of others who may not be as financially literate.</p><p> Keep your message simple and clear by using easy-to-understand language and concepts, avoiding industry jargon, explaining more sophisticated financial terms and applying other plain language principles.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 15:44:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 15:44:42.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_J9fnk9C.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/surprising-stats-revealed-in-report-on-financial-literacy-and-retirement-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"10856\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 15:44:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 15:44:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"surprising-stats-revealed-in-report-on-financial-literacy-and-retirement-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10855\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5301\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Surprising-Stats-Revealed-in-Report-on-Financial-Literacy-and-Retirement-Planning_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"675\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462525200,"author_id":126,"chart_url":""}

She&rsquo;s gentle and kind and, as a massage therapist/life coach, spends her life helping others feel better.  Being mean to her is a little bit like being mean to the Easter Bunny.  It&rsquo;s just not cool.</p><p> Like an electric fence, the unfiltered and often hurtful comments that get posted teach us all a dangerous lesson.  They teach us to hold back and play it safe so we don&rsquo;t get  hurt.  And while it may be counter-intuitive to do so, we cannot let that stop us from showing up.  For real.</p><p> I firmly believe and teach that there is power in vulnerability.  That as human beings we connect most deeply to those who are willing to share themselves &ndash; honestly and powerfully.  I find that all my favorite writers are a wonderful combination of brilliant, quirky, neurotic, and courageous.  They are the heroes in my mind.  The ones willing to share their fears, mistakes, hopes, heartaches, and hungers in attempts to help us all feel less alone.</p><p> One of the reasons I started blogging so regularly is because I felt it was necessary for me to work on being more courageous.  If I was inviting others to take down their masks and step into their power, then I had to do the same.  Power that comes through vulnerability.  I&rsquo;ve seen this power and experienced it countless times.  I know it to be true.  But darn it!  It&rsquo;s so hard to do the vulnerability-thing when you have got a perfection-thing going on at the same time!  The two traits just don&rsquo;t play well together in the sandbox!</p><h3> So for me, perfectionism had to go.</h3><p> <br/> And, truth be told, I have to keep a careful watch to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t sneak back in, because it&rsquo;s a devious sucker!</p><p> To truly connect.  To be as powerful as we were put on this planet to be.  To authentically lead.  These things require great courage.  The courage to play full out.  The courage to be willing to be seen &ndash;  because true connection cannot happen from behind a mask.  The courage to, in the face of all that&rsquo;s snarky, get back up and do it again.</p><p> I suspect, dear blog-readers, that you&rsquo;ll find grammatical errors in most of my posts.  Sorry about that.  Read them anyway.  Or don&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;m not going to wait to be perfect before I participate.  Just as I hope you don&rsquo;t wait to be perfect either.

Rowe Price Group, AARP, the Financial Industry Regulatory Group (FINRA) and others. The research team, which included well-known industry veteran Harold Evensky, found only 11 of the 36 worthy of a passing grade. The team cited overly simplistic tools as one of the main reasons for its harsh assessment.</p><p> For example, most of us are aware that health care costs have been rising faster than overall inflation, yet many calculators ignore the issue, which can have major consequences on retirement planning. The average person who has smoked throughout adulthood has a 6.5 to 15 year shorter life expectancy than a non-smoker. This point alone can have major implications on retirement planning.</p><p> In our opinion, even robust retirement tools are fraught with &ldquo;irregularities&rdquo;. All of these tools require assumptions about things like: returns, inflation, life expectancy, income and expenses, to name a few. As well intentioned and rigorously researched these assumptions are, they still remain, well, assumptions. Case in point, the average annual return for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 87 years has been 9.5%. Over the last 50 years 9.61%. The average would imply an assumed 9.5% return for stocks is reasonable, yet, over the past 87 years care to guess how many times the S&amp;P actually returned 9.5%? If you said zero, gold star for you!</p><h3> But Hey, it&rsquo;s Only Your Retirement Money</h3><p> <br/> So, why does it matter, if returns still average out to 9.5%? We end up in the same place, right? Actually, no. And, it is because of the sequence of returns. The sequence has big implications when it comes to retirement planning and, unfortunately, cannot be pre-determined. Experiencing lower than &ldquo;assumed&rdquo; returns in the first few years of retirement can have major negative implications. Above average returns also change the calculus. So what do you do?</p><p> With a fail rate of almost 70%, results from online calculators should be taken with a healthy dose of caution. Calculators can provide directional consistency, however for a truly rigorous analysis turn to your financial advisor, who typically, has  more comprehensive and detailed software at his/her disposal.</p><p> Advisors are also subject to &ldquo;assumption irregularities&rdquo;, the difference, however, is a good advisor adapts and adjusts as actual results tip the assumption scale in one direction or the other. This is where the &ldquo;rubber hits the road&rdquo; and where an advisor&rsquo;s value can really shine.</p><p> Similar to driving direction websites like MapQuest, retirement calculators can show you how to get from one place to another, but can&rsquo;t adjust for unpredictability. Without more data, like real time traffic updates, you could find yourself sitting in a traffic jam as you make your way across town.   The same could be said for retirement calculators, without robust planning tools and consistent monitoring, your favorite retirement calculator could be taking you down the wrong road.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 16:31:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 16:31:08.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_UewB7X7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/even-robust-on-line-retirement-tools-are-fraught-with-irregularities/\", \"post_id\": \"10860\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 16:31:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 16:31:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"even-robust-on-line-retirement-tools-are-fraught-with-irregularities\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10859\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5303\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Even-Robust-On-Line-Retirement-Tools-Are-Fraught-With-Irregularities.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"786\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462528800,"author_id":372,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5102,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"May 2016: Where the U.S. Economy Stands Today","link":"may-2016-where-the-u-s-economy-stands-today","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of economic data, updated through March since the full slate is not available through April:</h3><img alt=\"\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-economic-data.png\" width=\"749\"/>Let&rsquo;s walk through the economic situation in the United States next.<h3> <strong>  Labor market continues to show strength </strong></h3>The labor market remains the bright spot in the U.S. economy, pushing back fears that a global slowdown, triggered by China, would tip the economy into a recession. The unemployment rate remains at a low 5%, even as labor force participation has started edge higher, rising from 62.4% in September 2015 to 63% in March 2016. Monthly job growth in the first quarter has been healthy, averaging 209,000. While the pace of monthly job growth in 2016 has slowed from the prior two years (251,000 in 2014 and 229,000 in 2015), the current pace is more than sufficient to keep up with population growth and indicative of a growing economy. As the following chart shows, year-over-year growth in payrolls is hovering around 2%, which is close to the highest growth rates seen prior to the Great Recession.<img alt=\"\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/US-labor-market.png\" width=\"785\"/>Weekly initial unemployment claims have also remained in a tight range between 250K and 290K over the first four months of the year, with the four-week average falling to its lowest levels since 1973 at the end of April. At the same time, average hourly earnings have seemingly slowed their rate of increase in 2016. While year-over-year growth rate is still in the 2.0-2.5% range, the upward trend in earnings growth that we saw in 2015 appears to have broken. As the next chart shows, earnings growth is still mired at levels well below what we saw prior to the Great Recession, a fact that has significant implications for the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rate policy and their decision to continue on a rate hike trajectory amid a lack of sustained wage growth.<img alt=\"\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/average-hourly-earnings.png\" width=\"789\"/><h3> <strong>  Housing impeded by lack of inventory </strong></h3>The housing recovery continues, albeit sluggishly. Both housing starts and building permits declined in March but the prior two months were revised higher. Starts are up 14.2% and permits up 4.6% from their March 2015 levels. New home sales have also declined over the first quarter, though sales were up 5.4% year-over-year in March. The big picture however remains the same, in that new home sales are still at historically low levels, despite their rise from the bottom in 2011. The chart below shows the seasonally adjusted new home sales rate across several recessions (shaded areas) since 1970.<img alt=\"\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/family-houses-sold.png\" width=\"786\"/>A lack of inventory has led to home prices continuing their rise nationally. The Case-Shiller national home price index <a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2016/04/real-prices-and-price-to-rent-ratio-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> increased</a> 5.3% year-over-year in February. In nominal terms, prices are still 3% below the bubble peak, while in real terms, the index is still 17% below the peak.Slower growth is expected going forward as low inventory puts pressure on sales, except in oil-producing areas like <a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2015/12/lawler-yes-houston-will-have-problem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Houston</a>, where inventory is actually rising but prices are declining. A <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/demand-side-of-housing-market-problems-2016-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> big issue</a> in the housing market currently is that too few houses are being built up for the number of people that want to move into them. This drives up prices and keeps lower-end or first-time buyers off the market. According to recent data from the nonprofit Conference Board, the number of Americans indicating that they plan to buy a home in the next six months is at historic levels, 5.4% in April versus an average of 3.6% since 1978.<h3> <strong>  Consumption remains the driving force </strong></h3>Consumer sentiment has remained strong through the first four months of 2016 amid reasonable wage gains. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment is hovering in a tight range around 90, close to the highest levels seen prior to and post-recession. This is belied in the continued strength in auto sales, which remain strong. After a slight slowdown from decade-highs in the first quarter, light vehicle rebounded to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of <a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2016/05/us-light-vehicle-sales-increase-to-174.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 17.42 million</a> in April. This is up 6% from the March sales rate and 4.2% from April 2015.Retail sales excluding autos also picked up their pace of increase in the first quarter of 2016. Consumption has remained the backbone of the economy, <a href=\"https://www.bespokepremium.com/think-big-blog/q1-gdp-misses-slightly-on-broad-deceleration-across-categories/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> contributing 1.27 percentage points</a> to GDP growth in the first quarter even as investments and trade dragged down quarterly GDP growth to 0.54% (advance estimate). Yet the pace of personal consumption expenditures slowed to 1.9% in Q1 2016, compared to 2.4% in Q4 2015 and 3.0% in Q3 2015. The personal savings rate also ticked up through the first quarter, hitting 5.4% in March compared to 5% in December.It remains to be seen whether consumption will pick up again in the second quarter as it did during the past two years, which also helped GDP growth rebound in respective second quarters. The rebound in auto sales in April may be an early indicator of this.<h3> <strong>  Manufacturing may have bottomed, but remains weak </strong></h3>Manufacturing, buffeted by the slowing oil and gas industry, continues to remain weak. As the next chart shows, ISM manufacturing PMIs (left axis) appeared to bottom out in December 2015 (at 48), and rose above the 50 level in March (51.8) for the first time in six months. However, April PMI fell back to 50.8. While the latest number still indicates expansion, it is an open question whether the sector will continue to do so.<img alt=\"\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/manufacturing.png\" width=\"790\"/>Durable goods orders (right axis) continue to show negative year-over-year growth, though the pace of decline has slowed since September 2015. Once again, we see a dip in March which suggests continued weakness in the sector despite a weakened dollar and a rebound in energy prices.Even as oil rebounded by more than 75% from its February lows of around $25 a barrel, U.S. production is yet to respond. <a href=\"https://www.bespokepremium.com/think-big-blog/us-production-not-responding-to-higher-oil-prices-yet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Drilling activity</a>, as indicated by the Baker-Hughes tally of rigs operating in the U.S., fell to a new low of 332 at the end of April, compared to 1,609 rigs at the peak of drilling activity. As Bespoke notes, it is unlikely that production will increase without a marked rise in the number of operating rigs, and despite a massive rally in crude prices we have not seen more rigs come on line. The opposite has happened.The impact of lower oil production is clear when you compare the unemployment rate in the Houston area to the national average, as in the following chart. Unemployment  in the Houston area has been ticking up since the beginning of 2015 and now matches the national rate, reversing a decade long trend when the area&rsquo;s unemployment rate was well below the national average.<img alt=\"\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/unemployment-rate-houston.png\" width=\"781\"/>A point we have consistently stressed in prior updates is that manufacturing makes up only about <a href=\"https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=259119&amp;category_id=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 12%</a> of the U.S. economy. So it is important to keep some perspective on the impact of this sector on the overall economy.<h3> <strong>  A weak dollar may provide a respite </strong></h3>The rally in oil prices has been accompanied by a softening of U.S. dollar strength, with the U.S. dollar index falling more than 5% over the first four months of the year. In theory, this should provide some breathing room for the export sector. Yet the advanced Q1 GDP estimate indicated that export demand actually softened, dragging down quarterly GDP growth by 0.31 percentage points, compared to 0.25 percentage points of drag in Q4 2015.The diverging fortunes of the consumption sector and the export sector is summed up in the following chart, which shows personal consumption expenditures remaining solid (despite recent softening) while exports continue to decline year-over-year.<img alt=\"\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/personal-consumption.png\" width=\"785\"/>On the earnings front, Factset <a href=\"https://insight.factset.com/2016/04/earningsinsight_4.29.16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> reports</a> that the blended year-over-year earnings (combines actual results for 62% of companies that have reported and estimated results for companies yet to report, as of April end) have declined -7.6% in Q1 2016. Seven sectors are reporting a year-over-year decline in earnings, led by the Energy (-107.7%) and Materials (-15.3%) sectors. Three sectors are reporting year-over-year growth in earnings, led by the Consumer Discretionary (+17.7%) and Telecom (15.3%) sectors. If the overall earnings decline remains as it is now, this will mark the first time the S&amp;P 500 index has seen four consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines in earnings since Q4 2008 through Q3 2009.Going forward, a weaker dollar should  provide less of a headwind for several multi-nationals. So the earnings situation should turn around, especially in the latter half of the year thanks to lower base effects for year-over-year comparisons. Of course, the big question is whether or not the dollar weakness will indeed continue, and that brings us to the Federal Reserve.<h3> <strong>  The Federal Reserves pulls back from tightening, for now </strong></h3>Much of the dollar weakness came about in March and April, after the Federal Reserve (Fed) indicated movement to a more dovish policy stance. At the same time, European and Japanese central banks also indicated that they were done with more stimulus measures as of now, thus boosting their respective currencies versus the dollar.On the U.S. side, the Fed chose to back off raising rates in March and April after an initial hike in December. As the economist Tim Duy <a href=\"http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2016/04/warning-hawkishness-ahead.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> notes</a>, tumultuous financial markets and  softer data in the winter gave Fed doves the upper hand, leading to a pause in the &lsquo;normalization&rsquo; campaign and cutting in half the expected pace of rate hikes this year.The Fed seems more aware of the asymmetric risks they face than in December, and hence chose to err on the side of looser policy amidst all the uncertainty and tumult. However, it is not yet clear that the Fed wants to back off a rate hike in June, and would probably prefer to stay on a pace of quarterly rate hikes if they believe financial conditions have eased sufficiently. It also remains an open question as to whether economic data will move upwards after a lackluster start to 2016, and most importantly, if the Fed will deem any improvement as sufficient for tightening monetary policy further. Note that core inflation numbers, as we saw on top of this post, softened slightly in March. Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed&rsquo;s preferred measure of inflation, is sitting at 1.6%, which is still below their target of 2%.At the same time, financial markets have essentially written off a June rate hike. As of this writing, Fed Fund futures put the likelihood of a June rate hike at <a href=\"http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> less than 15%</a>. There is precedence for the Fed switching their stance within the space of six weeks, as they did between December and January. If they do so again, expect more volatility in financial markets as the Fed tries to prime the market for a June rate hike.Given the uncertainty of the economic situation, and how the Federal Reserve will move next, we believe it may be prudent to be cautious over the next month or two.

{"original_id":5104,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Say 'Yes' to Every Customer Service Request? Learn Why You Shouldn't","link":"do-you-say-yes-to-every-customer-service-request-learn-why-you-shouldnt","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently I engaged in an online conversation with one of our subscribers, Per Sjofors, and he shared an observation regarding customer service. He noted that even if a company takes care of every request, if its response is lacking in personality, it may not be perceived as good service. I agreed, and we talked more about what I call Stepford Service.</p><p> A number of years ago I wrote about the idea of Stepford Service. It is a concept based on the 1972 novel by Ira Levin titled  The Stepford Wives , which became a movie in 1975 (with a remake in 2004).</p><p> The movie was set in the fictional town of Stepford, Conn., where the women were brainwashed into mindless, zombie-like &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; wives who lived to cook, clean and take care of their husbands. A new couple comes to town and the wife senses that something is seriously wrong. She is determined to find out what&rsquo;s going on and make things right. You&rsquo;ll have to watch the movie to see how it turns out; I mention the movie not because it&rsquo;s a favorite of mine, but to make a point.</p><p> In the movie, the wives were subservient and mindlessly did whatever was asked of them. You might think that if this happened in business, it would be the perfect customer service. The answer would always be &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and customers would be sure to hear, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that for you right away.&rdquo;</p><p> Yet if the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you&rdquo; response is void of personality, in other words, zombie-like and mindless &ndash; robotic even &ndash; you might appreciate that your request was fulfilled but still not be impressed with the customer service. </p><p> The point is that customer service is more than just saying &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s more than doing what the customer expects. It&rsquo;s taking care of the customer with some personality. The personality traits of a customer-focused individual would include caring, empathy, sincerity, cheerfulness, and more. And remember, this isn&rsquo;t just about the front line &ndash; everyone has a customer, whether they are internal or external.</p><p> So, how much personality does it take? The customer needs to get some sense of enthusiasm and caring &ndash; even a slight demonstration of the customer-focused traits mentioned above can show the customer that you are not just going through the motions. And that may be all that you need.</p><p> Great customer service doesn&rsquo;t mean saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to every request. It&rsquo;s a little something more. It&rsquo;s the personality you put into the experience.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 17:28:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 17:28:12.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_4zscB8N.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-say-yes-to-every-customer-service-request-learn-why-you-shouldnt/\", \"post_id\": \"10873\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 17:28:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 17:28:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-say-yes-to-every-customer-service-request-learn-why-you-shouldnt\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10872\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5306\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-You-Say-Yes-to-Every-Customer-Service-Request-Learn-Why-You-Shouldnt.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1193\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462536000,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5105,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Make Smarter Decisions About Your Tax Refund","link":"how-to-make-smarter-decisions-about-your-tax-refund","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Many folks believe that their tax refund check from Uncle Sam is free money. Be honest: Are you one of them?</h3><p> <br/> I am sorry to report that's not an accurate assessment. If you're getting a large refund, you've given the Internal Revenue Service an interest-free loan of your money for the previous year &mdash; and we're sure you could have come up with a better use for that money than that.</p><p> If you are getting a refund this year, you are not alone. In a study conducted by Harris Poll, 69 percent of Americans expect a tax refund this year, with the average refund being $3,120.</p><p> A  <a href=\"https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/credit-education/newsroom/lexington-law-news/published-study-americans-tend-to-be-spend-happy-with-tax-returns.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study by Lexington Law </a>  reported that 35 percent of Americans who expect a tax refund this year have plans to spend it on something nonessential &mdash; vacation, entertainment or an electronic or mobile device.</p><h3> Men tend to look at refunds differently than women.</h3><p> <br/> According to a study by interest rates-focused website GOBankingRates.com, women who expect a tax refund are most likely to say they plan to use it to pay down debt, at 29.9 percent. Women selected this answer about 20 percent more often than men. However, men are also more likely to regret a purchase made with their tax refund than women (21 percent vs. 16 percent).</p><p> It turns out that the old saying \"Older is wiser\" is true when it comes to tax refunds, as well. The older you are, the more likely you are to be smarter with your tax refund. According to the Lexington Law study, men and women between the ages of 18 and 34 (44 percent) and 35 and 44 (38 percent) are more likely to spend their tax refund on something nonessential.</p><p> Given that information, it's no surprise that someone's age is also correlated to reporting a better credit score. As your age increases, the chance of reporting an excellent credit score increases, too. When comparing those in the age groups of 18&ndash;34 and 45-plus, the older generation was 67 percent more likely to report an excellent credit score compared to 53 percent of those younger than 35.</p><p> Sadly, looking at the trends of these spend-happy people, those with poor credit scores are some of the worst offenders. Lexington Law claims that those with low credit scores are more likely to consider a tax refund as a bonus check that should be used to buy themselves something rather than to pay off a debt (39 percent vs. 22 percent).</p><p> It turns out that credit scores, which are meant to help predict the financial behavior of individuals, are pretty right on. Low scores often equal high credit card balances. The amount of debt one person carries accounts for nearly a third of a FICO credit score, making it a very important factor for debtors to understand. Borrowers need to be careful about how much debt they carry if they hope to achieve a high credit score.</p><p> Based on this data, this highly indebted segment of the population &mdash; more than any other &mdash; needs to use these funds for debt repayments rather than lavish vacations or fancy new electronic devices.</p><h3> So how do people handle their tax refund?</h3><p> <br/> Are you a millennial with student loans and credit card debt to pay? Are you over the age of 45 with a good credit score, but the bills are still piling up? What is the temperature in the Bahamas right now?</p><p> There are many questions to consider when you receive your tax refund this year, but all of your answers should lead you to putting your money toward paying off bills and debts first.

Be Careful, Best Damn Doers","link":"are-you-the-hardest-worker-but-never-get-promoted-be-careful-best-damn-doers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Are you working too hard?</p><p> Does everything fall apart when you&rsquo;re not around?</p><p> Do you find yourself bailing out your boss, your peers, and your team?</p><p> If you can answer YES to any of these questions, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re being held back by the &ldquo;Best Damn Doer&rdquo; syndrome.</p><h3> Be careful.</h3><p> <br/> I know. I&rsquo;ve felt the guilt of being promoted over people working longer and harder than me.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve also promoted the &ldquo;right candidate&rdquo; over the one with the most sweat equity in the game.</p><p> And the other night, I had one of my clients ask me to help &ldquo;John,&rdquo; his high-potential &ldquo;best damn doer.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;John&rsquo;s the go-to for everyone, he adds huge value AND it&rsquo;s holding him and the business back. How do we get him past being &lsquo;the best damn doer?'&rdquo;</p><h3> 5 Ways to Overcome Being the Best Damn Doer</h3><p> <br/> The Best Damn Doers are the glue, the lynch-pins, the guys or gals who consistently win the awards&hellip;. AND yet are frustrated when year over year their less &ldquo;competent&rdquo; peers get promoted.</p><p> If this sounds like you, here are a few ways to back away from the grind and add additional value to the team&ndash;and your career.</p><h3> 1. Start with a Heart-to-Heart with Your Boss</h3><p> <br/> Bosses love the go-to guy. I know. I&rsquo;ve had them on speed-dial for years. But the truth is, your boss is likely the same person coaching you to &ldquo;delegate more and be more strategic.&rdquo; Even when it&rsquo;s your boss asking for you to be doing the doing, pause and explain how you&rsquo;re working to develop your team. Commit to setting clear expectations and inspecting outcomes, but resist the urge to be the one to take care of it, even if it&rsquo;s your boss doing the asking.</p><h3> 2. Build Skills Before the Fire Drill</h3><p> <br/> When the crap&rsquo;s hitting the fan, it&rsquo;s hard to hand over the reins. Bring your team in early and often in low-stake situations. Get them ready.</p><h3> 3. Delegate Well</h3><p> <br/> In Winning Well, we offer lots of tools to help in this arena. Be sure you&rsquo;re delegating process not outcome, defining the finish line, and are holding people accountable.</p><h3> 4. Ask Great Questions</h3><p> <br/> The best way to get your team thinking is to ask not tell. One secret to great leadership is getting your team thinking along the same wavelength. Ask your team open ended questions that encourage them to find solutions (if you&rsquo;re reading Winning Well, see pages 135-139 for a useful list.)</p><h3> 5. Be a Curious Learner</h3><p> <br/> Ask your team to teach you what they know. You might be surprised by their knowledge and approach. Then your coaching is gravy.</p><p> Bottom line. The more you can replicate your best damn doer skills, the better the results, for your organization, the team, and for your career.</p><p> Step away from the doing, and watch the magic.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 17:34:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 17:34:49.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_9TF4usx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-the-hardest-worker-but-never-get-promoted-be-careful-best-damn-doers/\", \"post_id\": \"10877\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 17:34:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 17:34:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-the-hardest-worker-but-never-get-promoted-be-careful-best-damn-doers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10876\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5308\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Are-You-the-Hardest-Worker-But-Never-Get-Promoted-Be-Careful-Best-Damn-Doers.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"768\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462557600,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5107,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do Cool Things That Matter? How Companies Are Revamping Strategies to Attract Millennials","link":"do-cool-things-that-matter-how-companies-are-revamping-strategies-to-attract-millennials","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In today&rsquo;s increasingly transparent job market, smart companies are turning the tables on their talent acquisition strategy. Rather than focusing their efforts outwards they&rsquo;re focusing inward. Websites like Glassdoor and Indeed give job seekers a window into what it&rsquo;s actually like to work in a company. Top talent are no longer solely basing their decisions on salaries and company revenue/financials. This means that employers need to make their company attractive inside and out.</p><h3> <strong>  Employer branding </strong></h3><p> <br/> Branding is not only used to attract clients, but also as a strategic method to attract the right employees. Top companies have realized that creating a strong company culture based on specific values that are unique to your company&rsquo;s purpose and vision will help attract the best candidates. Think about the messages companies put forth in their mission, purpose and marketing strategies. These messages tell potential hires what to expect from a company&rsquo;s work environment and priorities. This allows them to &ldquo;job shop&rdquo; for careers that fit their personality and ideals, along with their professional skills.</p><p> To millennials, a job is not just a source of income, but a part of their social and active lives. Accenture&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/t20150706T235021__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Dualpub_17/Accenture-UK-University-Grad-Research-2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   2015 College Graduate Employment Study  </u> </a>  found that 59% of recent graduates would prefer to work in a company with a positive social atmosphere over a place with a higher salary. Another 52% would forgo some compensation to work at a company with an impressive commitment to the environment or the social impact of its products and services. For example, think about some of the employer branding messages these top companies transmit:</p><p> <strong>  Zappos: </strong> &ldquo;Keep things weird&rdquo; - No straight-laced hierarchies and a collegial environment</p><p> <strong>  Google: </strong> &ldquo;Do cool things that matter&rdquo; - Use your creativity to work on groundbreaking products</p><p> <strong>  Patagonia: </strong> &ldquo;Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis&rdquo; - Social and environmental sustainability are a key concern in our actions and business decisions</p><h3> <strong>  How can your company develop a strong employer brand that delivers top talent? </strong></h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  1. Reinforcing Values </strong></h3><p> <br/> In order to create a strong brand it&rsquo;s essential to reinforce  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/culture-beats-paycheck-what-is-company-culture-360-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  company values </a>  on a daily basis. These companies are known for having a workforce that lives and breaths their values. This can only be achieved if they are reinforced through the feedback employees receive.</p><p> Zappos follows an organizational structure that emphasizes autonomy over direct management. Collaboration and knowledge sharing amongst peers is a key component to Google&rsquo;s success. Patagonia allows its employees to take up to two months time off to work with environmental non-profits. Feedback is essential to maintaining these unique working environments by encouraging peer collaboration and helping to quickly onboard new and returning employees.</p><p> The great thing about employer branding is that it doesn&rsquo;t just attract top talent, but also the right talent. Hiring for company culture fit was identified as a top priority for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/opinion/sunday/guess-who-doesnt-fit-in-at-work.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   80% of hiring managers </a>  in a recent survey. Given the importance that recent graduates place on work environment and culture, hiring talented employees that fit will help safeguard your company against turnover.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Development opportunities </strong></h3><p> <br/> Helping your people learn and develop continuously is the number one thing a company needs to offer to attract new talent. More responsibilities, stretch assignments and a chance to test out new ideas are a few ways to attract ambitious and motivated new recruits. Accenture&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/t20150529T025638__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Dualpub_15/Accenture-2015-Grad-Research-Weakest-Link-Infographic.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 College Graduate Employment Study </a>  cited 77% of respondents expect their first employer to provide formal training, but only 53% received any. At the same time, millennials more so than any other generation, have a strong aversion to steep hierarchies and micromanagement. Giving more continuous feedback will allow you to give your employees more autonomy and room to grow without being too hands on.</p><p> More and more companies are also realizing that, while hiring for culture fit may leave you with a more limited talent pool in terms of technical skill, coaching can help turn new hires with potential into top talent. According to  <a href=\"http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr940&amp;sd=3/17/2016&amp;ed=03/17/2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CareerBuilder </a> , 35% of employers trained low-skill workers and hired them for high-skill jobs in 2015, 33% plan to do the same this year.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Employee well-being </strong></h3><p> <br/> Caring about the well-being of your employees is one of the most important ways to make your company attractive to new talent. Fair wages and health benefits are a given, but companies are looking to expand these benefits by giving employees more freedom to choose when and how they get their work done.</p><p> Today companies like Netflix have become famous for giving their employees the freedom to take unlimited vacation. Their philosophy is that it&rsquo;s the results that count and creating a more responsible culture allows them to give this autonomy to their employees. Others offer flexible and remote working options. According to a <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   survey by Deloitte  </u> </a>  75% of Millennials feel more productive when working from home or other locations but only 43% are given this option. In the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aftercollege.com/cf/2015-annual-survey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AfterCollege 2015 Career Insight survey  </a> </u>  68% of recent graduates agreed that the ability to work remotely part of the time had an impact on their decision to accept a new position. Out of  <a href=\"http://genhq.com/announcing-the-best-places-to-work-for-millennials-2015-award-winners/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Center for Generational Kinetics&rsquo; </a>  &lsquo;Best Places to Work for Millennials&rsquo; list, 73% offer flextime or compressed work weeks.</p><p> However, these work arrangements require giving more responsibility to employees over their own agenda. The most critical challenge facing managers working with  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/get-things-done-when-working-remotely\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  remote teams </a>  is communication. Even more than in office based work environments, managers need to ensure that remote teams align with company goals and strategies and continue to feel connected while working. This is best provided through frequent conversations between employees and managers and a reinforcement of company objectives with each project.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re an innovation focused tech company or a service oriented startup, a strong company brand, development opportunities and flexible work options are what young talented employees are searching for today. Reinforcing your company&rsquo;s culture, providing regular coaching, while at the same time giving more autonomy, can only be achieved with  <a href=\"http://www.impraise.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  consistent feedback </a> .</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 17:46:19.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 17:46:19.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Mupx32E.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-cool-things-that-matter-how-companies-are-revamping-strategies-to-attract-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"10879\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 17:46:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 17:46:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-cool-things-that-matter-how-companies-are-revamping-strategies-to-attract-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10878\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5309\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-Cool-Things-That-Matter-How-Companies-Are-Revamping-Strategies-to-Attract-Millennials.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"986\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462550400,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}

The answer is actually &ldquo;no&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s good for business!</p><p> As long as everything is done with integrity, you build a very strong personal brand that people come to know and trust. For sales and entrepreneurship this is a stellar personality trait to be groomed.</p><h3> <strong>  My Story </strong></h3><p> <br/> A friend and I exchanged the following insights:</p><li> Those people who allow ego to take control of conversation are the ones who suffer from a lack of self-confidence.</li><li> Likewise, the reason some people focus solely on the small detail and not the larger vision is due to fear. They are afraid of stumbling in their quest to achieve something big, so they play small. <br/>  </li><p> Being of strong mind with determination to succeed will land you improved career opportunities. The same will get you in the door of the companies to which you wish to sell as well as connect online with people at a higher level.</p><p> In alignment with all of this, is the willingness to step out of your comfort zone to take calculated risk.

Consider Becoming an Encore Entrepreneur","link":"has-initial-excitement-of-retirement-worn-off-consider-becoming-an-encore-entrepreneur","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The celebration is over. No more early morning noise from the alarm clock. Rush hour traffic? A thing of the past.</p><p> That long anticipated retirement gave you the freedom you had hoped for. You took a cruise. You returned home and tackled the &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list. But now all of this is getting old. You are used to being busy, accomplishing things. You realize retirement isn&rsquo;t all you thought it would be.</p><p> It&rsquo;s an easy transition for some. Many enjoy a more relaxed lifestyle, spending more time with hobbies or with family and friends. But other retirees experience anxiety and even depression. For them being without a professional identity creates debilitating feelings of loss.</p><p> Think of this in the simplest terms. That familiar old question, &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; takes on a whole new meaning. How will you describe yourself? It&rsquo;s important to understand and accept a new identity now that you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;on the job.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that once you retire you are not the same person you were during your everyday work life. During most of your life you are identified by your career. Once retired you have to reinvent, or re-identify yourself. </p><h3> What do you really want?</h3><p> Face it. Switching to fulltime retirement is abrupt. That&rsquo;s why more and more people are making the decision to opt for a phased-in retirement, gradually transitioning into full retirement. More than a third of the people surveyed by the HSBC and Cicero Group say they want to stay on at their present job at least part time. They&rsquo;re opting to scale back work over a period of years instead of retiring cold turkey.</p><p> The concept of phased retirement is not new. According to the US Labor Department&rsquo;s Report of the Working Group on Phased Retirement, there is an increased emphasis among individuals to stay active and stay involved. Because the labor market is very tight, older workers are more in demand. They are valuable commodities.</p><p> If this option appeals to you and you&rsquo;ve made your plans for retiring known within your organization, don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s time to walk out the door to explore the option of staying on with your company either part time or as a consultant. Use your last year of fulltime employment to build a foundation for your post-retirement career. This gives you time to plan for life after fulltime employment while you still have the security of a paycheck.</p><h3> Become an &ldquo;encore entrepreneur&rdquo;</h3><p> Tired of working for someone else &hellip; or sticking around if you are selling your current business. Perhaps starting a new company makes sense for you. The Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City reports the highest rate of entrepreneurship in America has shifted from the younger set to men and women in the 55-64 age group. And people 55 and older are almost twice as likely to be successful with a start-up company than 20-35 year-olds.</p><h3> Identify your skills through self-assessment</h3><p> Start this process with an honest and thorough self-assessment. Put everything on the table and this goes beyond your work history. Consider your skills and even your likes and dislikes. Don&rsquo;t overlook general skills that are easily transferable to many professions. Be sure to include skills developed in your personal life apart from your profession. This assessment will help reinvent or repackage yourself for Life 2.0.</p><p> There is no magic wand for reinvention. It&rsquo;s a process and it takes time. But a thoughtful, planned approach is well worthwhile.</p><h3> Recalibrate Strategies</h3><p> Recalibrate Strategies help companies grow their business. We apply proven market-driven systems to recalibrate their business and their brands by collaboratively creating a success blueprint. We facilitate a process that harnesses insights, generates new ideas and provides a strategic roadmap. Our founder and lead consultant has 30+ years of experience as a CEO, entrepreneur and marketing expert with exceptional leadership and facilitation skills.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 18:55:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 18:55:13.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_smQPvEU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/has-initial-excitement-of-retirement-worn-off-consider-becoming-an-encore-entrepreneur/\", \"post_id\": \"10883\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 18:55:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 18:55:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"has-initial-excitement-of-retirement-worn-off-consider-becoming-an-encore-entrepreneur\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10882\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5311\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Has-Initial-Excitement-of-Retirement-Worn-Off-Consider-Becoming-an-Encore-Entrepreneur.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"691\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462539600,"author_id":464,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5110,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Blind Hiring Strategies: The Pros, Cons and Possibilities","link":"blind-hiring-strategies-the-pros-cons-and-possibilities","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Unconscious bias proliferates in all walks of life and, certainly, in corporate America. Despite plenty of coverage in the media and plenty of attention paid by companies that truly do wish to be inclusive, it remains an issue. From a business standpoint, unconscious bias is a particularly significant problem when it comes to the hiring process. As discussed in a 2014 Fast Company article on the subject, most of us honestly believe we are ethical and unbiased, but the simple truth is the opposite in many cases. </p><p> Recognizing this challenge, companies have spent a lot of time, effort and money on finding ways to mitigate the impact of unconscious bias on their hiring decisions. For example, some companies will remove names and addresses from resumes prior to their review, so it&rsquo;s harder for those reviewing to ascertain the sex, ethnicity or socio-economic background of an applicant.</p><p> This is often referred to as &ldquo;blind hiring.&rdquo; But, is it a good idea or a misplaced area of focus?</p><p> National Public Radio (NPR) recently ran a story about new technology designed to improve the ability of employers to practice blind hiring strategies. The technology masks the voice of an applicant. So, for example, a female candidate could be made to sound like a man over the phone. It&rsquo;s worth listening to the story, which contains a demonstration of the technology. It&rsquo;s not the garbled kidnapper or terrorist voice we often hear via Hollywood voice-masking tools. It sounds like an actual human being, just of the opposite sex.</p><p> There also are some interesting points made here about the downsides of blind hiring. One is simply the practical challenges. At some point, unless you&rsquo;re a virtual organization, you&rsquo;re going to need to meet applicants in person, and you&rsquo;ll discover their age, sex, race, etc. But, even if it were technically possible to hide certain characteristics of an applicant, some argue that we shouldn&rsquo;t want to because doing so can actually hinder your diversity efforts.</p><p> Many companies strive to promote diversity in their workforce, and part of that effort often involves searching specifically for candidates of color, of a particular age group, of a certain sex, etc. Blind hiring, if it successfully achieves its stated goal, challenges the ability to do this.</p><p> Proponents of blind hiring argue that it will negate the impacts of unconscious bias and encourage diversity by ensuring that the most capable and talented applicants get hired, regardless of their color, sex, ethnicity or religion. While it may be too early to determine the extent to which blind hiring helps workforce diversity efforts, but it&rsquo;s certainly worth considering the potential negative impacts as well.</p><p> What do you think. Are you a blind hiring proponent&mdash;or opponent? Why?</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 20:15:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 20:15:40.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_vdwB7i3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/blind-hiring-strategies-the-pros-cons-and-possibilities/\", \"post_id\": \"10885\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 20:15:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 20:15:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"blind-hiring-strategies-the-pros-cons-and-possibilities\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10884\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5312\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blind-hiring-Strategies-The-Pros-Cons-and-Possibilities.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1423\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462561200,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5111,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Shift from Self-Ignoring to Self-Love for Life Fulfillment","link":"how-to-shift-from-self-ignoring-to-self-love-for-life-fulfillment","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.theparadigmshifts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dr. Rosie Kuhn  </u> </a></p><p> I tell you, truthfully, that if all of us self-help enthusiasts would put into practice all the beautiful, inspirational advice we see on Twitter, in books and blogs, we&rsquo;d put therapists, psychologist, and a lot of medical doctors out of business. I believe it&rsquo;s possible that we are beginning to outsmart most mental health professionals. And as we do that, our physical well-being increase and dis-ease decreases.</p><p> The dilemma is that as much as we want to have sweeter and easier lives, we are afraid of change. And, as smart and intuitive as we are, and as much as we know, we rarely use our intelligence to choose to choose what we choose. So we hire other people and their intelligence who support us in our struggles and challenges. This is a good thing! </p><p> I have no doubt that, all of us eventually will get tired of choosing what we choose from our fear-based orientation. Sooner or later each of us will take those incrementally small steps towards the life we say we want.</p><p> So, in service to this one small, incremental step towards fulfillment of the human spirit, I began practicing a very simple exercise. Maybe you&rsquo;ll try it too. And, yes. It is easy. Well, most of it!</p><p> The premise is that, so many advice-givers tell us &ldquo;just love yourselves.&rdquo; Well, the fact is that, most of us are so far away from self-love, we can&rsquo;t even grasp the concepts. Truth is, most of us spend an incredible amount of time in the domain of Self-Loathing, where we treat ourselves with everything but self-respect, and self-respecting behavior. We gotta take this practice one step at a time. First things first:</p><h3> Step 1: It&rsquo;s Easy!</h3><p> <br/> Acknowledge yourself every day. Come up with 10 acknowledgments for who you are and what you did today that you appreciate: for instance, last night, one of my acknowledgments was: &ldquo;I acknowledge myself for playing outdoors with my dog Gracie for more than an hour.&rdquo; So, just come up with 10 of those. Right them down, if you&rsquo;d like.</p><p> Note here that these are not a list of gratitudes, though that can be Step 6, if you&rsquo;d like. However, you may naturally experience gratitude while you are doing this.</p><h3> Step 2: It&rsquo;s Easy!</h3><p> <br/> Come up with 10 things that you respect yourself for. For example: I respect myself for speaking my truth.&rdquo; Self-Respect is really important, and exercising the muscle of mindfulness allows us to focus in on the ways we really respect who we are and what we bring to the world.</p><h3> Step 3: Not So Easy!</h3><p> <br/> In regards to Self-Honoring, think of 5 things you honor yourself for. Just five? Yes, for now, just 5. Self-honoring may be a little more challenging to connect with, but, again, it&rsquo;s important to tap into this quality of being Self-Honoring, within your relationship with yourself. An example: &ldquo;I honor myself for the daring way I explore the opportunities that each day brings.&rdquo;</p><p> What helped me to make a list of how I self-honoring myself is &ndash; I thought about what it is in other people that I honor. I&rsquo;ve said to various people at various times, &ldquo;I honor you for&hellip;.&rdquo; What is it that I honor in others that perhaps I can honor in myself, if I see it?</p><h3> Step 4: Challenging Question!</h3><p> <br/> In what ways do you honor yourself? You may treat yourself with treats and gifts, perhaps indulge in things you&rsquo;d love to have. I think this is different. For example: &ldquo;I honor myself by keeping my body clean and fresh.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I honor myself by keeping fresh flowers in the house at all times.&rdquo;</p><p> By asking myself this question &ndash; How do I honor myself, I notice the many ways that I am not honoring myself. This is a good thing to see, because, it allowed me to see how I may be putting other people and things above myself. Too often, I don&rsquo;t take time to even do little things for myself that are part of self-honoring, such as my need to take care of my fingernails and toenails. I know that by caring for myself in this small way, it is a way to honor myself.</p><p> By asking myself this question, I have stirred the pot. Every day, now, since I began this practice I pay attention to opportunities to be self-honoring. For some reason it isn&rsquo;t easy to see, or, maybe I just need to cultivate more ways of being self-honoring.</p><p> Through this process, I&rsquo;ve become more self-compassionate. I see a lifetime full of honoring others above myself. There are deep feelings inside that surface through this realization. I comfort myself, I forgive myself for putting myself at the bottom of so many lists, because frankly, I didn&rsquo;t know any other way to be. Now, I&rsquo;m at choice. Now, I can attend to myself in ways that feel self-honoring to my heart, body and soul.</p><h3> Step 5: Very Easy!</h3><p> <br/> As I grow older, I realize that I love myself more and more. Even though my skin is wrinkly, my tummy more paunchy, I experience a delight waking up to another morning with myself. We (me and my body) have been through an enormous amount of life experiences over six full decades. Bringing awareness and appreciation for every aspect of me that has shown up to make that happen &ndash; well, that&rsquo;s a lot.</p><p> So, rather than starting out with &ldquo;I love myself for &hellip;,&rdquo; Step 5 is, to just notice when you may inadvertently experience a moment of love for yourself. With time you will experience this sensation more and more often. One step at a time, one moment at a time!</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-05 20:29:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-05 20:29:26.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_n7CAkr2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-shift-from-self-ignoring-to-self-love-for-life-fulfillment/\", \"post_id\": \"10887\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-05 20:29:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-05 20:29:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-shift-from-self-ignoring-to-self-love-for-life-fulfillment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10886\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5313\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Shift-from-Self-Ignoring-to-Self-Love-for-Life-Fulfillment.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1129\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462561200,"author_id":46,"chart_url":""}

Backstabbing, intrigue, secrets, false alliances, fighting against invisible enemies&mdash;for some people, it&rsquo;s almost like a normal week at the office.</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re not the only ones enthralled by this mash-up of world history and mythology.

(Even  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhWUFXvaZjo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sesame Street </a>  has gotten in on the act!)</p><p> We&rsquo;re also not the only ones to see parallels between Game of Thrones and business.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Business-Tim-Phillips-ebook/dp/B00UJIXJGK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428422328&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=game+of+thrones+on+business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Entire books </a>  have been written on the subject, and all the standard icons of the business press&mdash; <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/sungardas/2014/06/03/4-real-life-business-lessons-from-game-of-thrones/\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes </a> ,  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/john-brandon/8-business-lessons-from-game-of-thrones.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Inc </a> .,  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2013/03/29/game-of-thrones-a-business-leaders-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Fortune </a> &mdash;have done their requisite articles on it. Naturally, we couldn&rsquo;t resist the impulse to jump in.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are five things we think Game of Thrones can teach you about business: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  1. Frame discussions in terms your listeners understand </strong></h3><p> <br/> The characters who are successful in Game of Thrones are the ones who are good at this. Look at how well Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf, navigates the court. If the people he&rsquo;s working with don&rsquo;t understand or care about the political ramifications of an issue, he can always say, &ldquo;A Lannister always pays his debts&rdquo; and remind them that his family is the wealthiest in Westeros.</p><p> Similarly, successful wealth managers and financial advisors are the ones who can describe financial planning and the interplay of various assets in layman&rsquo;s terms.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Focus on what&rsquo;s best for the company rather than individual stakeholders  </strong></h3><p> <br/> More than once in the show, Lord Varys is asked which faction he serves, and he always responds dutifully, &ldquo;The Realm.&rdquo; While one can argue about whether that&rsquo;s true, it sounds good, and it is true that he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any loyalty to one particular group. He provides&mdash;and receives&mdash;information from all groups. And he continues to survive, which is no small achievement in Westeros.</p><p> Servicing your clients and focusing on what&rsquo;s best for them have proven to be keys to survival.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Think outside the box </strong></h3><p> <br/> Yes, it&rsquo;s a clich&eacute;, but characters often find ways to get what they want using nontraditional methods.</p><p> Remember when Viserys Targaryen thought he was safe enough to threaten his sister because Khal Drogo couldn&rsquo;t draw a blade on him in the holy city? He insisted that the Khal &ldquo;deliver the crown&rdquo;&mdash;which the Khal does in an unexpected way.</p><p> Several times, other characters faced with a legal challenge demand the right to trial by combat instead, and find a way to win the battle.</p><p> In other words&mdash;look for loopholes.</p><h3> <strong>  4. There are no absolute good guys or bad guys </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the most interesting aspects of Game of Thrones is its moral ambiguity. For example, House Targaryen feels that its king was unjustly killed and deprived of the throne, but House Stark and House Lannister saw Aerys as the &ldquo;mad king&rdquo; who needed to be killed to protect the kingdom.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re tempted to think of someone else in the company as an enemy, try looking at things from their perspective instead. Applying that empathy to servicing your clients and imagining their perspectives go a long way in establishing that understanding and trust.</p><h3> <strong>  5. It&rsquo;s good to have dragons </strong></h3><p> <br/> More than once, Daenerys Targaryen has succeeded because she has dragons&mdash;powerful and indefensible resources nobody else has. Similarly, the Lannisters used wildfire to destroy Stannis Baratheon&rsquo;s invading fleet.</p><p> What&rsquo;s your dragon or wildfire? What&rsquo;s the one thing in your company that you control or possess that nobody else does? In other words, what is your value proposition as a financial advisor?</p><p> One final piece of advice: If you get invited to a Game of Thrones-themed wedding, run away.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-07 23:19:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-07 23:19:55.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Qxwdl0W.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-business-takeaways-from-game-of-thrones/\", \"post_id\": \"10891\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-07 23:19:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-07 23:19:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-business-takeaways-from-game-of-thrones\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10890\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5316\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5-Business-Takeaways-From-Game-of-Thrones.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"982\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462816860,"author_id":308,"chart_url":""}

Hard to describe, harder to quantify.</h3><p> <br/> It is also not easy to talk about. And yet, every relationship &ndash; professional and personal &ndash; is enhanced when trust becomes an elemental force in that relationship.</p><p> Enter Tobi Luetke, the CEO of Shopify, an e-commerce software company. I was inspired by Tobi&rsquo;s conversation with Adam Bryant, the NY Times columnist who pens the wonderfully practical Corner Office column in the Times&rsquo; Sunday Business Section. At Shopify, they talk about trust.</p><p> We talk a lot about something called a &lsquo;trust battery,&rsquo; Tobi explains. It&rsquo;s charged at 50% when people are first hired. And then every time you work with someone at the company, the trust battery between the two of you is either charged or discharged, based on things like whether you deliver on what you promise. (NY Times, 4/24/2016)</p><p> And at Shopify, the notion of charging the trust battery is an integral part of the work culture. We decided to create a metaphor, Tobi elaborates, so that we can talk about this in performance reviews without people feeling like the criticisms are personal.</p><h3> Marvelous.</h3><p> <br/> A metaphor awash with brilliant allusions. A battery becomes depleted and needs to be charged. Most of us desire a long battery life. It behooves us to notice when a battery isn&rsquo;t charged. If we don&rsquo;t notice, trouble ensues.</p><p> Clear, right? Trust is not a fixed, static entity. There is no neutral, no holding pattern when it comes to trust. Our actions either charge or deplete the battery. Desire more success? Start to view yourself as a trust charger.</p><p> I have no easy tip list here. No 5 quick things that will charge the battery. Each relationship is different, after all. I suggest you begin with a little reflection, instead.</p><li> How am I charging the trust battery in my life right now? How would I fare in the annual Shopify Trust-Battery-Review?</li><li> What are 3 everyday behaviors I already engage in that charge the battery?  <strong>  Tip: Do them more often, with more people. </strong></li><li> What are 3 behaviors I engage in that tend to deplete the battery?  <strong>  Tip: Stop them at once. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Have fun with the trust-battery-metaphor. Yes, trust is ephemeral, but it is fueled by our simple everyday behaviors. Conduct your own trust-performance-reviews. Don&rsquo;t conduct them merely once a year, conduct them often. Make them an integral part of how you &ldquo;do relationships.&rdquo; You will be amazed at just how quickly the battery gets charged.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 15:01:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 15:01:38.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_8hctPgR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-am-i-charging-the-trust-battery-in-my-life-right-now/\", \"post_id\": \"10899\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 15:01:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 15:01:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-am-i-charging-the-trust-battery-in-my-life-right-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10892\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5318\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bridging-the-Robo-Divide-Misperceptions-Common-Awareness-Low-Adoption-Slow-Jury-Still-Out.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"454\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462809600,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

The other person, thinking &ldquo;outside of the box,&rdquo; was to build a pulley system that would help him move each one in 3 minutes. However, building the pulley system would take 23 hours. There was a deadline. Who would get it done first?</p><h3> (Don&rsquo;t actually do the math &ndash; I can tell you the girl carrying each one wins.)</h3><p> <br/> I don't know why this puzzle always stuck with me. Maybe it was one of the first times I was able to predict the leading answer wouldn't be correct. Maybe it was the only time I ever got a math question right. Maybe it was the symbolism &ndash; that sometimes the most basic way to get something done is the most effective.</p><p> Fast forward to today, and the math puzzle is ever-prevalent in the large organizations I work with. Often times, we spend so much time thinking of new ways to do things that we lose sight of the most effective way to get something done.</p><p> Trying to be &ldquo;outside of the box&rdquo; makes you very un-creative and incredibly un-productive. Organizations love to say they are removing limits. Open floor plans, &ldquo;matrix&rdquo; organizations, and &ldquo;thinking groups&rdquo; are being implemented and pushed forward in an effort to drive collaboration, creativity and innovation. While some of these are good for specific groups to question the status quo, we are actually finding that the removal of limitations and structure is having a profound effect on actually getting things done on a larger scale. By removing these limitations, organizations are trying to force creativity &ndash; to arbitrarily innovate &ndash; and often <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/11/stop-thinking-outside-the-box/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  end up with the exact opposite result </a> . Basically, employing too many disruptors produces disruption &ndash; not necessarily success.</p><h3> The limits of being &ldquo;inside the box&rdquo; &ndash; and limits in general &ndash; are good! Sometimes boxes are good!</h3><p> <br/> They can hold a lot of stuff! They can be stacked and labeled and organized! We know what can go in and out of a box. And, from a metaphorical perspective, they give us parameters under which to operate; a home base from where we can challenge and stretch our abilities. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2014/04/28/stop-thinking-outside-the-box-think-into-the-corners-instead/#3ddab8872e59\" target=\"_blank\">  Limits and processes provide an anchor or catalyst for thinking &ndash; not a constraint. </a></p><p> To increase the creativity and innovation on your team &ndash; to get them to think &ldquo;outside of the box&rdquo; &ndash; you need to actually create and define what box there is. It may sound counter-intuitive, but you can&rsquo;t think outside of the box if you don&rsquo;t know where outside is. It&rsquo;s this box, the limitations that are imposed, that make us our most creative. When we have parameters that we can&rsquo;t cross, this is when we truly innovate, to reach our goals in spite of limitations.</p><p> Creativity and innovation need to be organic. As much as we&rsquo;d like to, we can&rsquo;t turn on a creativity faucet. Creativity is born when two things intersect &ndash; individual perspective and the limitations imposed on that perspective. Creativity, innovation, &ldquo;outside of the box thinking&rdquo; &ndash; or whatever you want to call it &ndash; is a process that has to happen naturally <a href=\"https://canscorpionssmoke.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/stop-thinking-outside-the-box-all-you-need-is-now/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  and not take extra effort </a> . It&rsquo;s an evolution of current state into future state. And for that to happen, you need <a href=\"/development/how-authenticity-leverages-and-supports-innovation?platform=hootsuite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  everyone focused on their true strengths and bringing forth their best efforts </a> .</p><p> Don&rsquo;t focus on thinking outside of the box. Focus on creating your box. Define it. Enhance it. Use it to get things done. Process improvement, innovation and creativity all come over time through an openness to new perspectives that evolve from accomplishing the task at hand and actually getting things done.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 15:10:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 15:10:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_n7LyY8a.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-outside-of-the-box-is-unproductive/\", \"post_id\": \"10901\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 15:10:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 15:10:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-outside-of-the-box-is-unproductive\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10900\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5319\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/When-Outside-of-the-Box-is-Unproductive.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"976\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462788000,"author_id":232,"chart_url":""}

In fact,  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content marketing </a>  is not changing buyer behaviour.</p><h3> <strong>  A brief history of Content Marketing </strong></h3>The truth is, content marketing has been around for a long time &ndash; it all began back in the late 1800s.  In 1895, John Deere started publishing a magazine called, &ldquo;<a href=\"mailto:https://www.deere.ca/en_US/industry/agriculture/our_offerings/furrow/furrow.page\"> The Furrow&rdquo;. </a>The purpose of this magazine was to become a resource for his customers, and educate farmers on how to better manage their crops to become more fruitful business owners. John Deere published this magazine for the purpose of educating his target audience, not selling. By providing this magazine to farmers, John Deere wanted to become a thought leader and used content marketing to align farming with his expertise and brand. Clearly, this venture has been very successful for John Deere, which begs the question; was John Deere the original content marketer?<h3> <strong>  Traditional Marketing Vs. Content Marketing </strong></h3>What is really changing buyer behaviour?  It is the distribution and accessibility of content that is effectively changing buyer behaviour.  The evolution of content marketing and the way it is distributed and accessed is changing the ground rules in marketing and sales. Traditional examples of content marketing which include direct sales, static websites, print advertising, brochures, press releases, catalogues, branded magazines, direct mail, radio, and more, are phasing their way out.Traditional content marketing saw a gradual evolution from traditional content (hard copy) to digital and social content marketing. The evolution of content marketing has eliminated geographic constraints as consumers can now learn and read about anything online and on their mobile devices, regardless of their location. &lsquo;&rsquo;Googling&rsquo;&rsquo; has become one of the most popular words in the English language allowing online consumers to quickly and efficiently search for any topic under the sun- in less than one minute.In 1993, we saw the birth of the e-book, which paved the way for corporations to create content and publish it to a wide audience. In 1998, blogging became popular and it wasn&rsquo;t long until bloggers opinions and insights were regarded credible enough to make the news. In 2003, we started to get social with MySpace, which was soon surpassed by Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Digital and social content marketing also includes content such as case studies, white papers, blogs, e-books, Infographics, Webinars, Podcasts, Google + and more.<h3> <strong>  What does the evolution of Content Marketing tell us?  </strong></h3>The emergence and growth of digital and social content marketing means buyers are being bombarded with content and information overload on a daily basis. So, what can we take away from the evolution of content marketing, and the content overload trend, and how does this relate to Advisors in the Financial Services industry? First, let&rsquo;s look at some statistics that speak to the accessibility of content, and the importance of the new form of content marketing:<li> 92% start with a search engine when looking for a particular product or solution.  <a href=\"https://www2.cremarc.com/acton/attachment/8805/f-d5881df5-0e9d-428d-a4bc-860be97190a4/1/-/-/-/-/Digital%20Marketing%20Infographic.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (Cremarc, 2015) </a></li><li> 60% of the sales journey is completed before a customer makes contact with a sales person.  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-inbound-sales-slideshare-hspr?__hstc=241978781.8ad1d062eae77b517d703229ee8be673.1458739651941.1462373038655.1462720425426.17&amp;__hssc=241978781.4.1462720425426&amp;__hsfp=2547014204\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (Hubspot, 2015) </a></li><li> 61% have an open mind when searching online.

Advisors can no longer differentiate by service, price, and performance. In a world where the majority of the sales journey is complete before a consumer speaks to a sales person, people are choosing to do business with you because of your specialized and unique thought leadership, that should be easily accessible online.  How can Advisors cut through the content overload?<li> In order to cut through the noise, Advisors need to create content that is unique, valuable, and of high quality, instead of promotional.</li><li> Advisors need to create content that is for the consumer, rather then for promoting the business.</li><li> Content needs to offer the consumer content that is new and provides value to them.

{"original_id":5118,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Targeting The Affluent: These 3 Strategic Positions Must Be Adopted","link":"targeting-the-affluent-these-3-strategic-positions-must-be-adopted","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The nirvana for most professionals is to work only with affluent, and acquiescent, clients.  The challenge in doing so is that the affluent will inevitably become more difficult to get in front of personally. They will become less acquiescent.</h3><p> <br/> As with the famous line from Jurassic Park &ndash; &ldquo;life will find a way&rdquo; &ndash; so too does technology find a way to get between the service provider and the consumer of those services.  Nowhere in the market will this be more apparent that with the affluent consumers.</p><p> Whether we see technology and associated software solutions as distractions, or interruptions, or alternative choices, is a moot point.  The problem is that the affluent are almost invariably are the greatest adopters of new technology and software solutions which deliver convenience at reasonable price points.  The affluent are far more likely to have accounting software packages for instance, which they use to monitor and manage their own finances, and which in turn minimise the need for a significant amount of accounting or financial planning advice that the consumers would have &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; from a professional a decade ago.  The affluent are far more likely to use technology platforms which personally access for banking, lending, managed or mutual fund investments, and so on.</p><p> Technology finds a way to introduce convenience and control into the lives of the intelligent consumers.  The affluent have a tendency to be intelligent and well educated  of course, and typically have become affluent either because their education provided them with a high paying career path, or they have built and retained wealth through entrepreneurial endeavours.  Either way, using technology for such people is not unfamiliar territory. In fact, such people are far more likely to have homes with systems installed which allow them to open and shut doors or curtains with an app controlled from their smartphone, or manage their home entertainment system remotely&hellip;and so on.</p><p> What this means for professionals is that the ideal clients we often describe &ndash; the affluent &ndash; are in fact the most susceptible to robo-advice or other technology-based solutions.  They are the segment of society which would appear to be most likely to sidestep product intermediaries in the future.  A simple personal example should illustrate the point:</p><p> 15 years ago I would typically pay something like $4,000 per year to my accountant to complete some bamboozling sales tax returns for my business, together with figuring out the final end of year tax return.  In part I was paying for convenience, but in truth I was paying a lot of that fee because of the complexity of the goods &amp; services tax returns at the time and the sheer amount of time that was involved.  The process of compiling and then delivering the information to the accountant, who then started sorting it and figuring everything out took weeks (if not months sometimes) and multiple meetings and phone calls.</p><p> Now I use a software package which costs me something like $300 per year, and which is accessible from my smartphone, or tablet, or desktop, and which can be used by myself or any staff in real time.  Oh, and doing a GST (sales tax) return now takes less than 10 minutes.  No accountant is involved in that process any longer.  Technology rules, huh?</p><p> For any professional who aspires to work predominantly with the affluent there are 3 strategic positions which must be adopted in the development of the practice, if the practice is to survive commercially.</p><h3> 1. The service offered to the market by the practice or individual professional must be something separate from packaged product.  </h3><p> <br/> In simple terms this means a practice needs to be offering something other than managed funds, or facilitating insurance policies, or tax compliance.  As with the example above, we must be mindful of the services which can be reduced to algorithms and data management &ndash; and technology solutions will move into those areas as well.</p><h3> 2. WE must be users of the very technology which challenges our business models.  </h3><p> <br/> It is not so much a matter of &ldquo;keep your friends close but your enemies closer&rdquo;, but a matter of us embracing the same manner of doing business as our target market.  We have to be in accord with their environment, not in conflict with it.</p><h3> 3. Accept that &ldquo;data is the new gold&rdquo;.  </h3><p> <br/> It is not a currency per se, but it is a store of value for the firm.  It can be turned into currency for our practice in any number of ways.  Data is the key link between all the technology and software solutions which we choose to use with and for clients, and the technology solutions they choose to use themselves, as well as our relationship and services with those same clientsand products which they may use.  Customer data links all of it, and all of it wants more of the customer data.</p><p> For a professional practice positioned for the future to work with the affluent these 3 strategic positions will be critical I believe.  The separation of advice or professional services from product, together with being a leading edge technology adopter, and a relentless focus on digging for data and then capturing and storing it (even if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to do with it yet) are the keys to positioning the business to work with the affluent.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 16:08:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 16:08:39.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_5Gh1yjD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/targeting-the-affluent-these-3-strategic-positions-must-be-adopted/\", \"post_id\": \"10905\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 16:08:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 16:08:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"targeting-the-affluent-these-3-strategic-positions-must-be-adopted\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10904\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5321\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Targeting-The-Affluent-These-3-Strategic-Positions-Must-Be-Adopted.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1281\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462780800,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5119,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Eight Financial Moves That Can Ruin Everything","link":"eight-financial-moves-that-can-ruin-everything","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Your financial success sometimes depends on making the right moves at the right time.</h3><p> <br/> But even more often, it&rsquo;s avoiding the wrong moves that will advance your financial happiness. Big mistakes can destroy your chances of achieving your goals.</p><p> Here are eight moves to make sure you avoid. </p><h3> <strong>  1. Borrow against your 401(k) plan.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Unless you have a medical emergency and no other possible source of relief, leave your 401(k) plan alone. Not only do you have to pay the plan back with interest and take growth assets out of play, but you run the risk of having to recognize income if you leave your job without paying it all back. Add in the tax and penalty cost and you&rsquo;ve got a huge uphill climb. Just say NO!</p><h3> <strong>  2. Neglect to insure against your biggest risk.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you have financial responsibility for others and you fail to insure your future earnings, you are rolling the dice. Your biggest risk is not a dented bumper, it&rsquo;s your human capital (what you expect to earn in your lifetime). And don&rsquo;t think enough life insurance to pay off the mortgage is all you need. Just add up your cost of living and see if the elimination of principal and interest would leave your family solvent. And don&rsquo;t forget to take a look at disability coverage to protect your earnings.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Ignore your budget.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming in and what&rsquo;s going out on a monthly basis, you are navigating in the dark above a sinkhole. MAILCHIMP BREAK Chances are, it&rsquo;s only dumb luck that hasn&rsquo;t sent you headlong into financial disaster.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Pay the minimum on your credit cards.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s face it, even at zero percent interest, unless you make real progress in eliminating consumer credit, your cards will eventually go to market rates. From there it&rsquo;s a short slide to harassing phone calls and demands for payment. Get serious about reducing your debt or face the never-ending cycle of being neck deep in payments for the foreseeable future.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Pay your bills before you save.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Financial planning rule number one: pay yourself first and then live on what&rsquo;s left over. If you don&rsquo;t begin the habit of saving NOW, then when? It&rsquo;s easy to pass this one off and say that you will save your bonus, save the money Aunt Matilda sends you for your birthday or save when you finally pay off that credit card. Cut the excuses and just start saving today.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Don&rsquo;t seek professional advice when you&rsquo;re out of your league. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sorry, but understanding how to match your risk tolerance to an appropriate portfolio shouldn&rsquo;t be left to a website that asks you to answer 12 questions and whoosh&hellip;there&rsquo;s the answer with the right investments. It&rsquo;s vital that you acknowledge what you don&rsquo;t know and ask for help. There&rsquo;s no shame in it&mdash;but NOT coming to grips with that fact is like taking a long walk off a very short pier.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Accept financial noise as truth.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Whether it&rsquo;s the guy in the line at Starbucks talking about a &lsquo;hot stock&rsquo; or a web article touting the one investment you HAVE to own, examine this &ldquo;information&rdquo; carefully before accepting it as truth. Just because something sounds good, true or realistic doesn&rsquo;t make it so. If you leap at the &lsquo;can&rsquo;t miss&rsquo; opportunity, chances are you&rsquo;re going to get burned. Remember, whether it&rsquo;s the recommendation of TV pundits or your plumber&rsquo;s brother-in-law&rsquo;s first cousin, don&rsquo;t let your internal greed factor lead or you&rsquo;ve got a great chance at blowing your hard earned cash.</p><h3> <strong>  8.

{"original_id":5120,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Earn the Right to Ask for the Dance","link":"how-to-earn-the-right-to-ask-for-the-dance","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> One of the biggest motivation killers in sales and business is fear of rejection, whether it&rsquo;s getting a raise from your boss, starting up a new relationship with a prospect, or presenting the price and trying to close the deal.  </h3><p> <br/> Many times, it&rsquo;s not what you asked for that broke the deal; it was the mental framing that you created for the client by the way that you ask for it. </p><p> There is tremendous power in being able to earn the right to ask them to dance.  If you can do this right, you can have your own business and be free.  You can work from home, enjoy time with family, see your kids grow up and be there for them. You won&rsquo;t have to worry about whether or not your boss is having a bad day. </p><p> Every player knows how to do this flawlessly.  I&rsquo;ve seen players ask for ridiculous things and get them, just because they have perfected the process of asking for the dance.  This blog is going to teach you what players know about how to earn the right to ask them to dance.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the critical dynamic that you have to grasp to be effective as a player.  You have to accept that the prospective client, who is now paying you nothing, has all the power over you and you have none in the beginning of the transaction.  If you are a player, as you progress through the sales process you are gradually winning the power over so that in the end they trust you enough to decide to give you some control by going with what you recommend.  It&rsquo;s that simple; acquire control by making them give you power.  You will thwart the process by asking for things - anything at all, from a meeting, to returning an email, to paying for the service &ndash; before you have earned enough trust to get them to give you the power over them.</p><p> Think back to when you were 13 years old.  Remember those junior high school dances on Friday nights when the girls used to get approached by pimply, voice-cracking hormonal teenage boys and asked to dance?  She could see him coming a mile away. She&rsquo;s turned off before he got there.  She knows she&rsquo;s about to get pestered for something that she doesn&rsquo;t really want to do.  She&rsquo;s already been asked by ten other guys that night and turned them all down.  By the time he squawks &ldquo;you wanna dance?&rdquo; she&rsquo;s already headed for the bathroom with her girlfriend pack.  Awkward, tense, and tenuous. Painful.</p><p> The successful teenage boy-players, however, were the ones that asked the girl to dance the right way.  Now let&rsquo;s say that he smiles and casually starts up a conversation once he gets there.  He makes her laugh by telling a tactful joke, and introduces himself to her friends.  He takes the time to learn what kind of music she likes, and asks her if she enjoys dancing to this particular song.  If she doesn&rsquo;t like the music, he requests her favorite song to the DJ. By the time the conversation ends, he&rsquo;ll ask her to dance and she&rsquo;ll say yes.  She&rsquo;ll probably end up hungering for more attention after the dance is over. See?  Smooth player style in action.</p><p> It is not that clients don&rsquo;t love aggression and pushiness.  Quite the opposite.  These are dominant characteristics. Everybody wants the boss, remember?  Confidence turns people on.  It&rsquo;s not that clients don&rsquo;t love obsessive attention, and to be chased. People love this.  But confidence is perceived as arrogance if the salesperson doesn&rsquo;t make the prospect feel, not know but feel, that there is a great and urgent importance to buy what is being sold.  Obsessive attention comes off as desperation when the client is not made to understand the need they may have.</p><h3> Everything in life is a sale, whether it&rsquo;s getting a better job, getting a new client for your business, or even gaining more responsibility in a current job.  You need to know how to sell to move up and better yourself financially. </h3><p> <br/> Do it right and you&rsquo;ll earn the right to ask for the dance. Do it right, and they&rsquo;ll pay the price you ask for.  Do it wrong, and it becomes a power struggle that results in:</p><li> <strong>  The wear down. </strong>  Once you are relegated to the &ldquo;pushy salesperson&rdquo; sphere, the client engages in &ldquo;getting rid of the pushy salesperson&rdquo; tactics: avoided phone calls, emails sent to spam, meetings canceled.  You have to overcall until they respond because they realize that you are simply not going to go away until they tell you no.  Sometimes you may get lucky and be able to wiggle your way back into the deal, but it&rsquo;s hard.  The odds are against you.  Remember that you still have no power at this point.  </li><li> <strong>  Lying, deception, other forms of manipulation in order to get the client back. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Asking the client what you need to do to earn their business. </strong>   This never works.  First of all, it&rsquo;s your job to figure out their needs, not theirs.  If you don&rsquo;t know what they need by the time you ask for the sale, you have messed up somewhere along the way. Second of all, asking this direct a question to someone who has all power over you makes you appear desperate in their eyes.</li><li> <strong>  Price cutting/granting service for free.   </strong> Buying the business is not a sale. It is a sign that you failed at a sale. Doing work for free gets old after a while and hurts the team&rsquo;s morale.</li><li> <strong>  Bribery.  </strong>  Go to Morton&rsquo;s Steakhouse on any given weekday evening and you&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s predominantly there.  Food is the accepted bribery currency in the sales process.</li><li> <strong>  DNC&rsquo;d. </strong>   Placed on the &ldquo;do not call&rdquo; list.  The client has the power to simply say &ldquo;never call me again&rdquo; and by Federal law you have no choice by to cease all communication.  Push them far enough and they will do so.</li><li> <strong>  Reticence. </strong>   The tight lipped prospect who is so scared of being pushed into a sale that he won&rsquo;t tell you anything about his problem. Somebody could be bleeding to death and they&rsquo;ll put on the tourniquet themselves if they don&rsquo;t trust you enough to do it.  If they say something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not comfortable disclosing the details on this right now&rdquo; you have a lot more work to do before you can ask for the dance. <br/>  </li><p> I will use the example of a law firm that I called upon to sell technology services.  After cold calling for a year and having no success in penetrating, the IT director got fired.  His second in command, who had been a mere help desk technician, now held the reigns.  He inherited a huge problem; the phone system was broken, resulted in dropped calls that led the attorneys to lose billable time with clients. </p><p> So there was a tremendous opportunity for me to make a sale.  I brought along my telecom partner who made a reasonable bid that turned the prospect on.  But a few days later during my weekly sales meeting, my sales manager had a different strategy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pitch that we come in and do an assessment of their entire IT infrastructure, document it, charge them for this, and then propose an upgrade to a new system.  Go get a meeting set up with the new IT director&rsquo;s manager, the CFO. We&rsquo;ve got to get to the person in charge.&rdquo; </p><h3> Sounds simple, right? Wrong!  It would be great if it were that easy.</h3><p> <br/> The problems with approaching the deal this way are several. </p><li> <strong>  Being new to the role, the IT director is overwhelmed and insecure.  </strong>  The last thing he wants to do is to expose management to a better resource (an IT firm), one that could possibly be seen as a replacement.  So to suggest a meeting with his superior is asking him to put himself into a threatening situation. If he has any common sense, he will never do that.</li><li> <strong>  Being new to the role, the IT director doesn&rsquo;t want to make too many demands on his new boss.  </strong>  Remember, he has to earn his bosses trust, just like we have to earn his trust, before he asks his boss to dance.  Introducing a system wide overhaul might be the right thing to do from a technical perspective, but from a budgetary perspective this is probably the last thing that his boss wants to hear about.  You are putting the IT director in bad position by making him engage in the role of the pimply teenage boy.</li><li> <strong>  We haven&rsquo;t spent enough time understanding his network to know if the system overhaul is really necessary. </strong>   Make a big pushy proposal before you know what the needs are results in getting sent to &ldquo;pushy salesperson doghouse.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Just because we met with him once doesn&rsquo;t mean he trusts us.  </strong>  I don&rsquo;t have any right to ask him to dance. In fact, I don&rsquo;t even have the right to ask for any more of his time. <br/>  </li><p> The proper action to take at this point isn&rsquo;t to do what my sales manager said, but instead to spend some time devising a creative way to get more time with this client in order to understand his true needs.  He&rsquo;s probably being hit with a ton of proposals from sales people who don&rsquo;t get the game.  The task at hand is to differentiate myself from them by showing the IT director something valuable that will compel him to want to take a meeting with me, and then asking powerful questions which educate him.  I decided that some possible next steps would be to send him a testimonial about another law firm that we worked with, or to offer an educational webinar. </p><p> It turns out that my intuition was right.  A few days after the phone meeting, my telecom partner and I received this email:</p><p> &ldquo;John, sorry for the delay in responding. We&rsquo;ve got to slow this process down a bit.  I spoke with my project manager and it looks like there&rsquo;s a lot more involved with migrating to a new phone system than I thought.  I&rsquo;ll email you in a few months.&rdquo;</p><p> What was the &ldquo;lot more involved&rdquo; with putting in a new phone system? As My Antonio would say, &ldquo;dinero.&rdquo;  Just like I thought, being new to the role he was intimated by the idea of having to ask his boss for money.  If I had applied pressure to start up a computer software deal, it would have totally backfired, leading me to be lumped into the &ldquo;pushy salesperson&rdquo; sphere. </p><p> Deals like this illustrate the power of the question that every player must ask himself: &ldquo;Have I earned the right to ask for the dance?&rdquo;  Listen to your clients, try to read their minds, and you will earn their trust by knowing how to time the demands that you make of them.</p><p> Many salespeople ask the client to jump into a paid engagement way too early, before they&rsquo;ve educated them as to the value of the product or service or taken the time to understand the client&rsquo;s willingness and ability to pay for the product.  This turns the prospect off.  Once you get categorized into that &ldquo;pushy salesperson&rdquo; sphere, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to journey back to the safe zone of &ldquo;trusted advisor&rdquo;, which is the place you want to be standing for you to make the sale.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 17:09:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 17:09:40.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_4kNxbYg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-earn-the-right-to-ask-for-the-dance/\", \"post_id\": \"10909\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 17:09:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 17:09:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-earn-the-right-to-ask-for-the-dance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10908\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5323\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Earn-the-Right-to-Ask-for-the-Dance.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"566\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462791600,"author_id":424,"chart_url":""}

For example, we will trade stocks with gains twice as fast as selling stocks with losses despite tax advantages for selling losses. Sports teams consistently take fewer three-point shots, steal fewer bases, and attempt fewer two-point conversions than the odds would dictate.</p><p> This phenomenon has also been well documented in organizations. Some of the most notable examples are Kodak refusing to recognize digital, Xerox basically abandoning Windows technology, and retailers failing to recognize the impact of the internet. Why do companies act this way in spite of the many cases in which change is both organizationally and financially justified?</p><p> One big reason is our aversion to losses. Thus, it isn&rsquo;t risk-taking that affects poor decision as much as aversion to losses. In the three examples cited above, no one got fired for the poor decisions until the companies started to decline and affected workers were laid off. In contrast, missing a budget (positive plans) causes lots of people to get fired in short order. So, how do we correct this problem? A better way of objectively evaluating the risks and outcomes of decisions would be a great start. A few tools to aid this process are:</p><h3> <strong>  Goals and Needs:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The simplest technique is to understand the needs and goals of your partners in a relationship. For example, are you willing to endure short-term losses to develop long-term gains? Similarly, how are much are you willing to invest in efforts like quality, customer service, and people to improve the chances of success?</p><h3> <strong>  Beware Of and Minimize Bias:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The greatest detractor from effective decision-making (which can be intentional, random, hidden, or even unknown) is bias.</p><li> <strong>  Probably the greatest source of bias is our own set beliefs, experience, and reliance on &ldquo;We have always done it that way!&rdquo; </strong> Thus we simply ignore information or facts that are different than our own.</li><li> <strong>  A second is our information and perspective. </strong> For example, right-brain and left-brain people simply look at different things and look at them differently.</li><li> <strong>  A third factor is incomplete or wrong information. </strong> The most glaring issue is that showing a relationship does not necessarily mean cause and effect. For example, if you flip heads five times in a row with a fair coin the probability is still 50 percent that you will flip tails the next time. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  No Pain, No Gain:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> In general, I recommend more consideration of the process of decision-making. How good is our information, what are the consequences of mistakes, and how much risk can we afford? I frankly believe with the exception of issues like safety, we can afford more risk. We generally are overly concerned with the consequences of mistakes than the potential of risk. This approach is well stated by Sheryl Sandberg in her comment: &rdquo;What would you do if you weren&rsquo;t afraid?&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Be More Open:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Organizations need to be open to measurement and feedback. Observing, understanding, and sharing financials, operations reports, and sales reports are the first step. Simple research studies that social media can provide are tools to use regularly. A management style such as the &ldquo;walk around&rdquo; and asking simply, &ldquo;How are you doing? Is there anything you need?&rdquo; can be priceless. One of my favorite phrases is, &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t making mistakes you aren&rsquo;t trying hard enough.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 17:27:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 17:27:05.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_sx0QpU3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/it-isnt-risk-taking-that-affects-poor-decision-as-much-as-aversion-to-losses/\", \"post_id\": \"10911\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 17:27:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 17:27:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"it-isnt-risk-taking-that-affects-poor-decision-as-much-as-aversion-to-losses\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10910\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5324\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/It-Isnt-Risk-Taking-That-Affects-Poor-Decision-as-Much-as-Aversion-to-Losses.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"560\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462813200,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5122,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Mistakes the Will Tank Your Business Pivot","link":"three-mistakes-the-will-tank-your-business-pivot","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There&rsquo;s a reason people in human resources talk about &ldquo;change management.&rdquo; Change is hard.</h3><p> <br/> Many of us are creatures of habit who don&rsquo;t particularly welcome it. And if it affects your company, that can be especially scary because most of us depend on our jobs to earn a living. </p><p> It&rsquo;s ironic that while  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2014/01/24/why-your-top-talent-is-leaving-in-2014-and-what-itll-take-to-retain-them/\" target=\"_blank\">  many employees will leave jobs in pursuit of development opportunities </a> , just as many will fight like the dickens to maintain the status quo, even as the powers that be work strenuously to promote change.</p><p> Of course, skittish employees aren&rsquo;t the only reason organizational change fails. Other reasons are just as&mdash;or perhaps even more&mdash;significant. Here are three reasons (and three examples) from the big guys.</p><h3> <strong>  1. The change isn&rsquo;t compatible with the brand:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let's start with Walmart. Nearly a decade ago, the &ldquo;Everyday Low Prices&rdquo; seller of food, home goods, electronics, music, clothing, and just about anything else you can think of looked to expand its market. They brought in higher-priced, upscale items like trendy fashion in order to attract new customers.</p><p> But the move never really took hold. Higher-end consumers were decidedly underwhelmed, and lower-end consumers started looking elsewhere for bargains. Walmart  <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/wal-mart-finds-fewer-sales-going-upscale\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  got a new advertising agency </a> and forged on, but it was not to be. In 2012, they announced plans to refocus efforts on low prices.</p><p> (Recently, however, now that its traditional superstores are losing traffic,  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-looks-to-grow-by-embracing-smaller-stores-1404787817\" target=\"_blank\">  Walmart has begun experimenting with upscale goods </a>  in smaller stores. Will this strategy work better the second time around? We&rsquo;ll see.)</p><h3> <strong>  2. The change is hampered by human psychology:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sometimes, no matter how good or sensible an idea, consumers aren&rsquo;t having it.</p><p> The year was 2012, and rather than offer sales and coupons, JCPenney had a better idea: &ldquo;month-long values&rdquo; that would do away with the hype and drama of specials and so-called &ldquo;reductions.&rdquo; Instead, consumers could rest assured they were always getting the best price, period.</p><p> Unfortunately, customers hated the idea and criticized JCP&rsquo;s implementation. The company suffered a  <a href=\"http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/Analyst_JCPenney_rebranding_worse_than_we_thought_11943.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  20% drop in profits in the first quarter of 2012 </a> , along with strong negative consumer feedback. JCP&rsquo;s then-president, Michael Francis, announced his resignation soon thereafter.</p><p> Unfortunately for JCP, consumers want sales, and they want coupons even more. There's something about getting a deal, even a fake one, that feels good.</p><h3> <strong>  3. The change comes too late:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The giant brick-and-mortar store used to be the mainstay of the book market.

I&rsquo;ll leave all that to the theologians.</p><p> Much of a customer&rsquo;s journey with a brand depends on the words and images that they encounter in marketing, shopping, and post-sale. All to often, the words chosen by brand representatives are crafted in haste without careful consideration of the audience to which they are intended. Therein comes Pope Francis!</p><p> When speaking to an audience of 70,000 at a &ldquo;teens only&rdquo; event, Pope Francis made a statement that was both startling and brilliantly crafted. In a sermon that contrasted the power of technology with the power of religion, he noted: &ldquo;Your happiness has no price. It cannot be bought or sold. It is not an application you can download on a mobile phone. Even the latest version can not help you to grow free in love.&rdquo;</p><h3> Holding a iPhone as a visual cue. Pope Francis went on to suggest that life without Jesus is like a smartphone with no bars.</h3><p> <br/> One additional culminating image from the journey for some in the audience was a selfie with the Pope.</p><p> Again side-stepping the religious overtones of the message, there is much to be learned from the willingness of a messenger to position his words and imagery to the benefit of the audience. This 79-year-old head of state and head of the Roman Catholic church effectively connected with an audience of teenagers through a message designed for them, not designed for him.</p><h3> <strong>  So, here are some questions for you: </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Who are your key customer segments?</p><p> What images, lifestyle elements, and references are relevant to them?</p><p> How can you authentically weave those images and messages throughout the customer journey with your brand? (e.g pre-sale, throughout the sales cyle, and post-sale)</p><h3> Is your brand voice in keeping with the ever-changing wants, needs, and desires of your audience?</h3><p> <br/> Unlike our businesses, I suspect all Popes have and forever will draw massive crowds. However, much like us, there will be those Popes that will connect at a greater level than others. The strength of human connections (at the papacy and in our day to day life) depend upon our ability to understand our audiences and our humble willingness to craft consistent messages that serve them.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 17:56:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 17:56:20.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_OOP30UF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/your-happiness-has-no-price-it-is-not-an-application-you-can-download-on-a-mobile-phone/\", \"post_id\": \"10915\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 17:56:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 17:56:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"your-happiness-has-no-price-it-is-not-an-application-you-can-download-on-a-mobile-phone\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10914\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5326\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Your-Happiness-Has-No-Price-It-Is-Not-an-Application-You-Can-Download-on-a-Mobile-Phone.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"850\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462806000,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

Where would they be seeded? Where would they play their first game?</h3><p> <br/> A poll of these fans sought to figure out how they got the news of whether their favorite team made it into the big dance. Eight different channels were identified as being the primary source of information for at least 10 percent of the fans polled. Among them were Twitter, emails from their alma mater or alumni groups, blogs, TV networks, word-of-mouth (texts, phone calls from friends, office chatter), mobile app alerts, newspapers and sports news websites.</p><p> From my years working with financial advisers and RIA firms, I know many in the business are huge college basketball fans. But the nugget of information I bring you today and its implications for the RIA community isn&rsquo;t about college basketball. It is representative of a bigger challenge RIA firms face as information sharing evolves and is shaped by innovative technologies and new patterns of human behavior.</p><p> Gone are the days where evening newscasts or local papers broke news stories. Direct mail feels like a quaint relic of the past and emails have proliferated to the point that they are as equally likely to be deleted as they are to be read. Yet, evening news is still relevant. People do like reading mail &ndash; from their mailbox or from their inbox &ndash; and others still peruse the newspaper over a morning cup of coffee.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/media-channels-americans-use.png\" width=\"616\"/></p><p> Now, some in the business think the biggest &ldquo;F&rdquo; word to impact their business is the fiduciary rule announced by the Department of Labor  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/the-dols-fiduciary-rule-the-best-marketing-for-your-financial-advice-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  last month </a> . But I contend another &ldquo;F&rdquo; word will make engaging current clients and attracting new ones more difficult than ever: fragmentation.</p><p> There is no longer a &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; means of communication for advisers that guarantees to reach their target audience in one fell swoop. Fragmentation is here and seems to occupy the space between relevance and obsolescence for a wide variety of news and information sources.</p><p> Fortunately, the marketing communication paradigm has evolved to help meet this new challenge. Given the natural time and resource constraints facing RIA firm leaders, the idea of having to proactively communicate and engage in multiple arenas can feel daunting. But worry not &ndash; integrated public relations campaigns have replaced &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; decision-making, a process where advisers were forced to make tradeoffs by focusing on only one or two marketing channels.</p><h3> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s how an integrated PR program can make a difference in this era of information fragmentation: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Commit to custom content. </h3><p> <br/> Buying canned content is relatively cheap. Curating content shows you are paying attention. But custom content trumps the canned and curated on three fronts: it establishes your firm&rsquo;s voice and specific perspective, it can power your SEO and publicity efforts, along with the connection of the author to your content, and it makes the material more shareable in a world revolving around social media.</p><h3> Leverage your content across distribution channels. </h3><p> <br/> Is your content good enough for your company blog? If so, it&rsquo;s probably worth repackaging on LinkedIn Pulse. Did you happen to receive positive feedback from a recent presentation topic? Chances are those same soundbites will resonate with the press. The time and effort you put into generating custom content is too valuable not to mobilize in multiple fashions.</p><h3> Find ways to measure feedback or response. </h3><p> <br/> It is stunning how many RIA firms fail to monitor their web traffic. Most advisers on social media tend to vastly under or overestimate the size of their social networks simply because they aren&rsquo;t paying attention. What blog post was viewed the most? What LinkedIn comment yielded the most shares, likes or comments? These are just a few examples, but knowing what resonates with your audience and how to locate them can dramatically boost the return on your time investment.</p><h3> Expand your audience with media coverage. </h3><p> <br/> Our friends in the media are regularly seeking experienced professionals to provide perspective on topics of interest. Chiming in when opportunity knocks can mean putting your firm&rsquo;s name in front of new audiences. It also offers you the opportunity to leverage the media outlet&rsquo;s distribution to reach new people and prospective clients.</p><p> Adapting your communications and marketing efforts to meet the increasingly fragmented audience is no longer a choice, but an imperative. Failure to adapt could crush your future marketing efforts and leave you in the dust behind your peers.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 18:22:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 18:22:54.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_joGMHjS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-the-f-word-that-will-crush-your-business-is-here/\", \"post_id\": \"10918\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 18:22:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 18:22:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-the-f-word-that-will-crush-your-business-is-here\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10916\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5327\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Advisors-The-F-Word-That-Will-Crush-Your-Business-Is-Here.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462784400,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

I had forgotten to bring my wallet and only realized this when I was already at the cashier. Fortunately, she gave me an online payment option, and helped me open the app on my cellphone. After she scanned a barcode into the app, my payment transaction was promptly logged. She even gave me a small discount for using the app&mdash;something the app company subsidizes in order to encourage more users.</p><p> Maybe things are changing even faster in China than I realized, I thought. Credit card usage is already quite prevalent but could I actually get by without any cash in the country&rsquo;s capital city? I decided to conduct a month-long experiment to see. </p><p> My favorite neighborhood restaurant is a 10-square-meter small eatery that sells river snail rice noodles, a specialty of Guangxi province, which borders Vietnam. The restaurant walls inside are covered in graffiti left by customers and to place your order, you are given an iPad to select your meal. I chose my favorite style of noodles with an extra vegetable topping and two extra pieces of fish cake. &ldquo;Can I pay with my mobile phone?&rdquo; I asked. </p><p> &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; was the response I got. &ldquo;And you are very welcome to become a restaurant member.&rdquo; The staff helped me open the phone app, search for the restaurant&rsquo;s account name and pay the less than US$5 for my meal. With the initial set up done, I could also save time by ordering from home and then just stopping in to pick up my order. </p><p> There are more than 30 restaurants, bakeries and caf&eacute;s in my neighborhood, and to my surprise, nearly all of them now accept payment via one of two of the most popular online payment apps. </p><p> Some even offered discounts when using some of the apps in which reviews can be shared. So for the 30 days of my experiment, I bought clothes, air filters and food online. I bought train tickets and travel insurance for my parents through mobile apps. I donated to a young rural leukemia patient on a crowdfunding platform&mdash;all of which was paid for through online payment apps. I even persuaded my housekeeper to open a payment account so I could pay her that way.</p><p> I used Uber-like car services, which of course were automatically paid through my mobile phone. Surprisingly, even small street vendors are catching on since I was able to buy a pack of &ldquo;sugar fried chestnuts&rdquo; from one of them with my phone for about US$2.</p><p> There are some shops in my neighborhood that do not accept mobile payment, including the dental clinic, the 7-11 convenience store, and a gym. And I was also not able to use those apps on U.S.-based travel websites to book hotel accommodations abroad for the Chinese New Year holiday&mdash;although of course I did not use cash either. </p><p> So after 30 days can you guess how much I spent in cash? <strong>  My total cash expenditure was 40 yuan or the equivalent of about US$6&mdash;for parking. </strong> Perhaps the parking meter attendant will soon take a mobile payment app but I have yet to ask.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-08 18:55:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-08 18:55:38.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_ddsxKE0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/china-has-ditched-its-old-cash-only-ways/\", \"post_id\": \"10920\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-08 18:55:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-08 18:55:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"china-has-ditched-its-old-cash-only-ways\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10919\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5328\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/China-Has-Ditched-Its-Old-Cash-Only-Ways..png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"540\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462798800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

If you need something from me please first email Bob who will serve as the liaison from you to me. Likewise I&rsquo;ll be sending Bob things to delegate to everyone. I think this will really help with workflow in the office. Just a heads up so that you know why Bob will be emailing you things like progress update requests. OK that&rsquo;s all for now!&mdash; -<h3> <strong>  Dear Boss, </strong></h3>Excellent choice! This will save Bob time as well, allowing him to collectively insult us in one email rather than doing it individually, which was his previous method and honestly a real time waster for everyone! Two birds, one terrible person, I mean stone. We&rsquo;re excited for the new procedure. After all, we&rsquo;ve always hated Bob, and we always will. OK that&rsquo;s all for now for us too!&mdash; -<h3> <strong>  Why your plan will surely backfire </strong></h3>Your employees will not blindly follow any leader. A recent Gallup survey found that only one person in ten can cut it in management. Oftentimes an employee is hired due to skills while attitude is ignored. Power is a sensitive topic and promoting the wrong person can create a domino effect of inefficiency in the office.&mdash; -<h3> <strong>  Maybe Try this instead </strong></h3>Listen to your employees. Make it a point to read the dynamics in your office. When they drop comments casually about their coworkers. Is one coworker mentioned a lot? Are the comments about the person tinged with negativity or positivity? Hear the underlying message &ndash; what F.I.T. President Joyce F. Brown calls the <a href=\"/grow/leadership/do-you-hear-with-your-third-ear\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo;third ear</a>.&rdquo;Place value on the people skills/soft skills and not just the technical skills of a potential manager prospect. If &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t someone people feel safe and comfortable around, thereby negatively affecting group cohesion, then he may not be the best candidate. Trust and respect need to be present in order to build cohesion.

{"original_id":5128,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Your Attachment Style Affects Your Relationships","link":"how-your-attachment-style-affects-your-relationships","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The way we communicate has a lot to do with our attachment style, which was formed early in our development. This style also plays a critical role in how we approach, interact, respond and react to our partner as we attempt to resolve conflict. This can be a good or a not-so-good thing depending on our individual styles. Understanding your own attachment style will provide a window into your vulnerabilities and strengths within the relationships in your life.</p><p> Our model of attachment influences how we get our needs met and the process in which we go about getting our needs met in relationships. Ironically, unless you know your attachment style, people often find partners that confirm our models &ndash; meaning if we grew up with an insecure attachment pattern, we will often seek out in an attempt to duplicate similar patterns as adults. We do this even though these relationships are unhealthy and often hurt us.</p><h3> <strong>  For example, meet Michael and Susan** </strong></h3><p> <br/> Michael and Susan have been together for 7 years. When they first met, Susan had a dismissive and avoidant style. She recognized that she could - at times - easily detach from others and had a tendency to avoid intimacy. She wanted to change this but knew it would take some significant work and introspection on her part. Her parents were never emotionally available &ndash; but available in other ways. Their divorce also had an impact on her life; as a result, she had a tendency to 'check out' in her relationships and appear somewhat complacent. However, that is not how she felt - that was just how she coped. Susan carried this same style through much of her adult life. It wasn't until she met Michael that she realized her relationship pattern and made changes so that she could create a healthier relationship with him. Michael on the other hand, was a secure person and provided the environment and the 'space' to help her grow. He challenged her when something came up and was able to communicate with her in such a way that made her feel safe - safe enough to acknowledge her vulnerabilities while simultaneously learning how to open up and feel more secure in their relationship.  </p><h3> <strong>  What&rsquo;s your style? </strong></h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  1. Anxious. </strong></h3><p> <br/> A person with an anxious attachment will feel insecure about their partner&rsquo;s feelings and feel unsafe in the relationship. They become clingy and demanding. Because anxious people bond quickly, they don't take the time to assess if their partner can meet their needs. They jump right in! They tend to see the 'we' and what they share in common, idealize their partner, and overlook potential issues. If their partner acts independent, they will interpret this as they are leaving and affirm their fears. For example, if their partner is interacting with other people, they might interpret this as &lsquo;they don&rsquo;t love me.&rsquo; They are anxious about the relationship, where it is, where it is going. Because relationships have some uncertainty about them, this often gets interpreted as unstable, which encourages more anxiety in the anxious person. </p><h3> <strong>  2. Anxious/preoccupied. </strong></h3><p> <br/> A person with this type of attachment will feel that, in order to get their needs met, they will have to be with that person all the time for the sake of reassurance. To support this theory, they actually choose a person who is isolated and hard to be with, which only reinforces  their belief. They often feel &lsquo;desperate in relationships and have an &lsquo;emotional hunger&rsquo; (Firestone). They look to their partner to rescue or complete them (Firestone). Their sense of safety is through clinging to their partner.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Dismissive/Avoidant. </strong></h3><p> <br/> A person with this type of attachment style is dismissive and distant. They appear emotionally detached. They feel the way to get your needs met is to act as though you don&rsquo;t have any needs. A person with this style will choose a partner who is more demanding or possessive. People with this style tend to lead inward lives; they deny the importance of connection, of others, can easily detach and shut down emotionally (Firestone).</p><h3> <strong>  4. Fearful Avoidant. </strong></h3><p> A person with this attachment style lives in a place of ambivalence &ndash; unsure and afraid of being too close or too distant from others. They try and keep their feelings at bay, but this ultimately becomes too arduous. Because they are unable to avoid their anxiety or run from their feelings, they are emotionally overwhelmed and experience emotional storms. They often live in an ambivalent state in which they are afraid of being too close to <br/> or too distant from others. They attempt to keep their feelings at bay but are unable to. Their relationships are rocky or dramatic. They have fears of abandonment, but also with being intimate (Firestone).</p><h3> <strong>  5. Secure. </strong></h3><p> <br/> When a person has a secure attachment style, they are confident and are able to navigate and interact with others. They are can meet their own needs as well as others. Parents understand what a baby needs and are able to provide it. They are highly attuned to their needs. They are more satisfied in their relationships and feel secure and connected. They can move more freely in relationships. Secure people are able to reassure their partners and provide support in times of distress and can equally go to their partner when they feel distressed.</p><h3> <strong>  How to change your from anxious or avoidant to secure.. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Learn how to express and honor your emotional needs. </strong> What are your emotional needs?</li><li> <strong>  Identify triggers that reinforce your attachment style. </strong> What are your triggers? Where do they stem from? What could you do differently to overcome and work through your triggers?</li><li> <strong>  Look for relationship patterns. </strong> Based on your style, what type of people do you seek out? Is there a pattern? What could be a different direction to take with relationships? Do you take time off from relationships to examine what went wrong and your contribution?</li><li> <strong>  Practice acceptance of self and your style. </strong> Accepting how we feel, without judgment, gets us to a better place, faster.</li><li> <strong>  Learn to react less and resolve more conflict. </strong> Look at the element of compromise. How do you react? What place do you come from when you react the way you do? What are the feelings that arise from your reactions?</li><li> <strong>  Learn to be assertive and use your voice. </strong> What are your needs, your values? What makes you feel unsafe? How can you communicate with your partner in a safe way to get your needs met but also honor theirs as well.</li><li> <strong>  Seek out therapy to learn how to become more secure and find those people who are capable of a secure attachment. </strong> Even if you are more anxious or avoidant, but finding a partner that is more secure, you will also learn how to become more secure. A good therapist can also help you make changes on your own, make internal changes, that will ultimately change how you respond in a new relationship.</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 14:43:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 14:43:43.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_tVcOWoz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-your-attachment-style-affects-your-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"10926\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 14:43:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 14:43:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-your-attachment-style-affects-your-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10925\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5331\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-Your-Attachment-Style-Affects-Your-Relationships.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2154\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462878000,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}

It's Time to Open Your Eyes","link":"are-you-going-through-your-business-day-with-blinders-on-its-time-to-open-your-eyes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Acceptance&rdquo; does not mean settling for less. It can actually be quite empowering.</p><p> Psychologist Nathaniel Branden said, &ldquo;The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.&rdquo; I think about this simple line often, in my personal life as well as my professional life. I verily believe that our happiness grows in direct proportion to our ability to accept a situation for what it is, and our understanding that there is a way through any situation.</p><p> That way comes down to a very basic decision: Accept your situation for what it is and choose to STAY the course, or decide there are greener pastures and&hellip;GO!</p><p> Acceptance looks like a passive state&mdash;a giving up of sorts. But, I actually see acceptance as the most powerful stance in the world. Acceptance says, &ldquo;I recognize that this is my reality and I am in charge of how I want to live my life. It is within my power and purview to impact my life and if I accept my circumstances as they are, I am actively choosing to do so.&rdquo; It is the difference between active participation in life and being a doormat that brings us peace of mind and gratitude for even the most imperfect situation.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve written in the past about my decision to leave a career in accounting to pursue my passion. Unsure what it was &ndash; but certain I wanted to put my strong communication and relationship skills to work &ndash; I made a conscious decision to change direction, open my own firm, and counsel financial advisors on finding the best path for their own careers. Make no mistake, taking this leap was huge and took enormous courage, but well worth it in the end.</p><p> What I have found, though, is that change isn&rsquo;t always the answer for everyone. Take my friend, Janine. She is very well-respected in her field, yet a few years ago was feeling less-than-satisfied at her job. Curious about what other opportunities might be available to her, she began to wonder if, perhaps, the grass could be greener elsewhere.</p><p> So Janine began exploring her options. She dusted off her resume and dug into her network pool to see what she might be missing. She went on several interviews and even received an offer of more money from another firm.</p><h3> Should she stay or should she go? <br/>  </h3><p> The new job, with its attractive salary, was definitely enticing. But, as she began to envision what her life could be like at this new firm, she realized that this exercise actually reignited her passion for her current company. The great benefits, the terrific team she had built from the ground up, and an understanding supervisor all had been part of her life for many years, and she had been very happy there. In weighing the possibilities opened up by the new opportunity against the realities of her current position, she began to feel that maybe her current firm was &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. And having done her due diligence and explored what options existed, she felt a renewed sense that she was &ndash; already &ndash; in the best place for her.</p><p> After much exploration and soul searching, Janine and I came to very different conclusions, but in the end, we share common ground: The awareness and acknowledgment of imperfection, the strength and willingness to do something about it, and the wisdom to actively choose the path that best fit.</p><p> Going through your day with blinders on &ndash; which may seem like acceptance &ndash; is simply a choice to ignore what&rsquo;s going on around you. Becoming aware of what&rsquo;s working for you and what&rsquo;s not, will allow you to either accept your current situation with greater empowerment, or propel you to seek another path. Either way, the choice is yours.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 14:49:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 14:49:45.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_QF5DnDq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-going-through-your-business-day-with-blinders-on-its-time-to-open-your-eyes/\", \"post_id\": \"10927\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 14:49:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 14:49:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-going-through-your-business-day-with-blinders-on-its-time-to-open-your-eyes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10928\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5332\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Are-You-Going-Through-Your-Business-Day-with-Blinders-On-Its-Time-to-Open-Your-Eyes.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"921\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462874400,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5130,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want to Know How to Embrace Client Experience Thinking and Techniques?","link":"want-to-know-how-to-embrace-client-experience-thinking-and-techniques","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The wealth management industry needs to remind itself&ndash; said the FCA at Compeer's compliance 2016 event earlier this month &ndash; what the new rules under MIFID II on cost disclosure are trying to achieve. The overall point being &ldquo;to help the consumer understand the costs and charges&rdquo;.</p><p> The FCA has already said it won&rsquo;t be providing a set format on charges so firms are free to approach this creatively but, crucially, \"from the perspective of the consumer\". This is a crucial point.</p><p> The FCA is very keen to see firms get more creative with their communications as June 2015&rsquo;s discussion paper on smarter consumer communications  outlined. It is also clear that they would like communication to be more than one way asking firms to think about testing communications on customers to see if information is really &ldquo;cutting through&rdquo;?</p><p> This sentiment is very aligned with MIFID II requirements for example the need to evidence that clients have accessed an online valuation. Merely putting the information out there won&rsquo;t be enough and in my experience of portals for wealth management clients and asset management customers, only a minority of core enthusiasts can usually be persuaded to use them habitually.</p><p> Given the huge investment that firms will have to make in MIFID II there is a strong business case for using the opportunity to improve client communication and engagement. Client engagement (rather than mere satisfaction) correlates better with the sort of behaviours we&rsquo;d all like to see &ndash; retention, greater share of wallet and that all important referral and advocacy behaviour.</p><p> Despite the fact that most firms would cite referral as their main source of organic new business growth, few firms have a structured programme around referral and client advocacy.</p><p> An audit of all your client communications and touchpoints as part of a MIFID implementation programme ought to be an early stage objective. Creative ideas will only come from taking the client's viewpoint however. Digital challengers are doing just that but their cost of client acquisition is high. Incumbents have an opportunity to identify what their clients&rsquo; value and where they need to invest in client engagement to ensure they not only protect their existing client bases, but accelerate their organic growth. </p><p> Applying client experience thinking and techniques, including journey mapping and client research might yield useful insights that not only smooth MIFID implementation and reduce risks, but actually yield commercial value.</p><p> Six initial ideas to consider:</p><li> Involving clients in the conversation around how costs and charges work and creative ways to illustrate and explain them, as an opportunity to reiterate your value proposition to clients. Involving younger clients in looking to the future of client communications around MIFID is an opportunity to address concerns about the next generation&rsquo;s tendency to disengage from their parents&rsquo; advisers as co-creation of communications ideas and propositions can help bond clients to you.</li><li> Looking at ways to use the requirement to obtain more information from clients as an opportunity to improve insight on client needs and share of wallet opportunities.</li><li> The need to issue valuations more frequently provides a requirement and an opportunity for greater continuity of dialogue than is possible on a six monthly basis on the ongoing value of what you are doing for clients.</li><li> Firms will need to look beyond online portals and email. Secure mobile instant messaging applications offer speed and cut through which is potentially appealing vis-&agrave;-vis the reporting obligations on significant losses in respect of portfolio management or contingent liability transactions.

We talk to ourselves about it &ndash; how money makes us feel, the choices we make about it, the kind of life we have because of it. Sometimes we talk to our friends, an advisor, or a coach about it. And we listen to others talk about money through various media outlets.</p><h3> But, what if money had a voice?</h3><p> <br/> What if this so-called energy form had a message for you? A message that it&rsquo;s been trying to get across but, because you haven&rsquo;t been listening you continue to struggle with it (money). You continue to experience vicious debt cycles, income fluctuations, and a disconnect from your value and worth.</p><p> What if money walked up to you and said that it could offer you a message of peace?</p><p> Would you stop whatever you are doing, right now, and listen? </p><p> For those ready to listen and hear &ndash; this is a letter from money, to you.</p><h3> <strong>  Dearest friend, </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m not at all everything you make me out to be.

{"original_id":5132,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Self-Evaluating Questions You MUST Ask Yourself to Assess State of Your Finances","link":"self-evaluating-questions-you-must-ask-yourself-to-assess-state-of-your-finances","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When meeting with prospects for an initial consultation and with clients for their first meeting, I tend to get the question of &ldquo;how do we compare to your other clients?&rdquo;</p><p> Most people have an image in mind of where they think they stand with their finances. It&rsquo;s either bad, reallllyy bad, okay, good or great. Ultimately though, it&rsquo;s hard to have a sense of confidence about where you stand without first doing the work to figure out, well&hellip; where you are standing.</p><p> I wish I could tell you that it won&rsquo;t be as bad as you think or it will be as great as you imagine, but honestly, we won&rsquo;t know until you take the time to evaluate where you stand and figure out what kind of moves you need to make to get to (or stay) where you need to be.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re looking to take stock and see which boxes you have &ldquo;checked off,&rdquo; here are some important, self-evaluating questions to ask yourself to assess the current state of your finances:</p><h3> Do you have a fully funded emergency fund?</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re a single income home, you should aim to have 6 month of &ldquo;must have&rdquo; expenses set aside into an easily accessible and liquid (i.e. cash / savings) account. If you&rsquo;re a dual income family, you can likely get a way with 3 months, but 6 is better.</p><p> Life is unpredictable and unexpected things happen all the time. It&rsquo;s not a question of if things will happen, but a question of when and your finances will be in a much better state if you have the cash set aside to handle those unplanned moments than if you need to rely on credit cards and dig yourself into debt.</p><h3> Is your credit score in the &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; range?</h3><p> Aim for a credit score to be 720 or higher.</p><p> Your credit score is your financial report card, except there&rsquo;s no getting rid of it after college. This number will save or cost you money over your life. The higher your score, the lower the interest rates you receive and the more money you save when it comes to taking out a mortgage or car loan.</p><p> Your credit score simply indicates your creditworthiness and tells a lender how reliable and timely you will be in repaying a loan. Having a strong credit score is invaluable to always provide you the best financing options.</p><h3> Are you saving at least 10% for retirement?</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re in your 20s, you should aim to save 10% of your income for retirement. If you&rsquo;re in your 30s, aim for 15%. The earlier you start saving, the better and when it comes to determining how much you should save, it&rsquo;s important to think through the future you want. Take the time to consider what it is you would love to do in retirement and when you think you&rsquo;d want to retire.</p><h3> Are you able to meet everyday expenses?</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re relying on credit cards and debt to get by, chances are it&rsquo;s time for a financial change.</p><p> Often times the reason people feel like they&rsquo;re living paycheck to paycheck isn&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t have enough money. It&rsquo;s that they aren&rsquo;t wisely spending the money they do have. When this is the case, it can be a fairly straight forward exercise to get your cash flow in order so that you can meet everyday expenses with ease.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to first understand your current spending habits by tracking your spending. Once you know where your money is going, you can determine which expenses you can eliminate altogether and other spending habits that could be altered to more easily cover your fixed expenses and align the rest of your money in the areas you care about the most. (Note, if getting out of debt is necessary &ndash; I recommend freeing up money to go towards a debt pay down plan).</p><h3> Do you feel well compensated for your job?</h3><p> Remember that when it comes to compensation, it doesn&rsquo;t have to only be about the salary. You can also consider benefits, bonus structure, employee stock options, flexible vacation policies and work from home arrangements.</p><p> If the income and benefits you earn for the work you do doesn&rsquo;t feel good, it might be time for a change.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be unwilling to negotiate a pay raise, especially after successfully completing an important project. If you&rsquo;re working hard and doing great work, ask to be compensated for that. If your current employer isn&rsquo;t able or willing to pay you what you&rsquo;d like, are you ready to consider a move to another company or start a side hustle? Forbes reports that employees who stay in companies longer than two years get paid 50% less. If you don&rsquo;t feel well compensated right now, know that you have options if you&rsquo;re willing to take action.</p><h3> Is your net worth growing?</h3><p> Your net worth is your total financial worth &ndash; measured in dollars and is something I consider a measure of your financial health. After you take all your assets and subtract all your liabilities, what you&rsquo;re left with is your total net worth.</p><p> As the years progress, what you want to see happen is that your assets grow and your liabilities decrease. Start with where you are today &ndash; know your number &ndash; and keep track every 6-12 months to see if your assets are, in fact, increasing over time. If your net worth is stagnant or in decline, you&rsquo;ll want to know what is causing the lack of growth so that you can tackle any issues getting in the way of your financial health.</p><h3> Do you have a debt pay down plan in place?</h3><p> If you have debt, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to have a pay down plan in place.</p><p> There are many ways to get out of debt, but the two most effective ways are the debt snowball and the debt avalanche. Both plans involve aggressively paying down one balance while making the minimum payments on the rest. The difference lies in what order you tackle the debts.</p><p> With the debt snowball method, you pay off your debt from the smallest to the largest balance so that you establish good habits and roll more and more money into the next debt. With the debt avalanche method, you pay debts down from the highest interest rate to the lowest interest rate so that you pay as little in interest as you can and roll that savings into the next debt. The most important thing is to have a plan in place on how YOU are going to pay down your debt and stick to it.</p><h3> Are your taxes under control &ndash; did you owe or receive a refund?</h3><p> Ideally, you want to break even at tax time, otherwise you&rsquo;re giving an interest free loan to the government if you get a refund (or you feel kind of annoyed if you owe). Zero is the goal!</p><p> If you owed a lot for taxes or you received a sizeable tax refund, something went awry this year. The way to make sure you don&rsquo;t owe again next year is to understand your tax liability and adjust your withholdings accordingly. Perhaps reach out to your human resources department to update your W-4 or adjust your quarterly payments if you&rsquo;re self-employed and business is growing.</p><h3> Do you have the right kinds of insurance in place?</h3><p> Insurance is a tricky topic, but at a minimum you should ensure you have some sort of health insurance and disability insurance in place. In addition, you&rsquo;ll need life insurance if there are others who are dependent on your income.</p><p> Property and casualty insurance (such as auto, home, umbrella and renters insurance) are also important to have in place. Always work with your broker or agent to confirm you have the appropriate level of coverage needed for your situation. Don&rsquo;t just guess at it!</p><h3> Are your investments appropriately diversified?</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re saving for retirement and your investments are sitting in cash, chances are the answer to this question is &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p><p> Your investments should be allocated based upon the time frame until you&rsquo;re needing the funds. There&rsquo;s debate between when to invest or not invest for short to mid-term goals, but if you need the funds in less than 5 years, a CD is going to be your safest bet.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re investing for the long run, ensure you have a mix of equities and fixed income, small and large firms and domestic and international. Leverage mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which will help you to diversify when starting out with smaller sums of money.</p><p> How many of the above did you answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to? If you&rsquo;re 10 for 10, then chances are you&rsquo;re on a solid financial track! If there are any questions that left you wondering or thinking you might need a change, there&rsquo;s no better time than now to make some adjustments.</p><p> The best thing you can do is be aware of how you&rsquo;re doing and keep track of your financial health year after year.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 15:02:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 15:02:20.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_zdu3KQn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/self-evaluating-questions-you-must-ask-yourself-to-assess-state-of-your-finances/\", \"post_id\": \"10933\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 15:02:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 15:02:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"self-evaluating-questions-you-must-ask-yourself-to-assess-state-of-your-finances\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10932\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5336\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Self-Evaluating-Questions-You-MUST-Ask-Yourself-to-Assess-State-of-Your-Finances.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"669\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462888800,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5133,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Choose an ETF That's Right for a Portfolio","link":"how-to-choose-an-etf-thats-right-for-a-portfolio","source_link":null,"content":"<p> ETFs offer investors compelling reasons to use them to build an entire portfolio, or &ldquo;fill in the blanks&rdquo; of a developed portfolio for those who want to further diversify. But how to choose the fund or funds that are a perfect fit &mdash; either within your current investment plan or with each other? With more than 1,600 funds to choose from, plus hundreds of indexing approaches, it can be a daunting task. Here are some guidelines for investors who are interested in a long-term strategy.</p><h3> First, determine your objectives</h3><p> <br/> All solid investment decisions begin with determining your goals. Growth is always a major goal but, depending on your circumstances, you may also seek to generate income or mitigate the risk already inherent in your portfolio. Finally, though you are investing for the long haul, you may find that a shorter term need for liquidity arises. Your goals will help you decide what type or types of ETFs to pursue.</p><p> Diversification should always remain a goal, of course. Decide which part of the market you want to be in. If you have developed a classic stock-and-bond portfolio, you may look to diversify with real estate or commodities, for instance. Or, you may need to further diversify the mix of industry sectors to bring your portfolio back into your planned balance.</p><h3> Do your homework</h3><p> <br/> All ETF sponsors make available detailed fact sheets on each of their funds. Once you&rsquo;ve made the list of funds that can potentially meet your investment goals, compare features such as size (assets under management, or AUM), top holdings (including their geography, market cap, sectors, etc.), dividend information, fees, expenses, risks and other key points to ensure that the ETF meets your investment goals and has strong potential for long-term appreciation. </p><p> You should also understand how the ETF and its underlying index are constructed. ETFs use a wide variety of weighting schemes, each of which can affect performance in different ways. A majority use market capitalization as their approach to fund design. These funds track a broad stock market or a particular industry sector. A theme-based ETF on the other hand balances large cap and small cap stocks. Another method, equal weighting, &ldquo;tilts&rdquo; toward small cap stocks in the fund by assigning weights to various stocks based on their importance in the sector. </p><h3> A note on fees and expenses</h3><p> <br/> There is no question that one of the key attractions of ETFs is their low expense ratios, the most commonly quoted cost of ownership. This number is expressed as a percentage of assets held and compensates the fund for managing ongoing operations. But this is not the only cost to compare. And, buyer beware: cheapest isn&rsquo;t always best. How closely a fund tracks its index is an important cost component to the investor. Tracking error is a measure of how closely a portfolio follows the index to which it is benchmarked. Consequently, an ETF with a very low tracking error can more than offset a point or two in expense ratio with its higher return.</p><p> A bid-ask spread is the amount by which the ask price exceeds the bid. This is essentially the difference in price between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price for which a seller is willing to sell it. Bid/ask spreads can matter sometimes even more than expense ratios. Market makers sell shares at the &ldquo;ask&rdquo; price and buy them back at a slightly lower &ldquo;bid&rdquo; price. Since you essentially lose half of the spread between the two price points depending on which side of the trade you&rsquo;re on, this cost becomes an important shopping consideration. (The longer you hold the fund, however, the less this spread actually matters to your total return.)</p><p> Finally, there&rsquo;s commission cost to consider. Remember that ETFs trade just like individual stocks and, although there are some commission-free ETFs, most brokers will charge a commission for any trade. If you trade ETFs frequently and make smaller investments, these costs can seriously erode your profitability.</p><h3> Consider the fund sponsor</h3><p> <br/> As with any purchase, you want to do business with a reputable firm. Make sure that the ETF you&rsquo;re interested in is sponsored by a strong company, has stable and experienced management and a clear record with regulators. Though past performance can&rsquo;t predict the future, track records count. Check whether the fund has successfully attracted investors since inception. Bigger may be better. It is important to look at average trading volume which is the average amount of individual securities traded in a day or over a specified amount of time. Trading activity relates to the liquidity of a security; therefore, when average daily trading volume is high, the stock can be easily traded and has high liquidity. Make sure that the fund has a good tracking record against its underlying index.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t be intimidated</h3><p> <br/> Though it may seem that shopping ETFs is overwhelming, due diligence can make the difference between substantial returns on investment vs. below-average profitability or even serious financial loss across the long term. All of the information we&rsquo;ve discussed today &mdash; and more &mdash; is available to investors in the sponsors&rsquo; facts sheets and annual or semiannual reports, from the SEC, and from most major brokerage house that offer the ETFs you are interested in. You can also find sound information and guidance on websites sponsored by national associations and in the general business and financial press.

Start These Steps This Week to Sharpen Your Skills","link":"work-in-sales-start-these-steps-this-week-to-sharpen-your-skills","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Three Simple Rules for Success in Sales</h3><p> If you want to know what truly separates top performers in sales, then look no further than these three simple characteristics below. Each and every top professional I know practices these habitually, and when I focused on these early in my career, I, too, became the top producer in my office of 25 sales reps.</p><p> These &ldquo;rules&rdquo; as I call them are essential for your success, and you should make it a point to incorporate and work on them every day of your professional career. If you do, you will easily rise to the top of your company and your industry. Read them over now and commit to incorporating them into your daily routine:</p><h3> 1) Invest in your attitude every day <br/>  </h3><p> You absolutely must do everything you can do to develop, protect, and nurture a contagiously enthusiastic attitude. Now more than ever, your attitude will be the biggest determining factor affecting your success in your profession of sales. Think about all the negative people you&rsquo;re going to run into today, this week and this month. Are you going to infect them with your positive, can do attitude, or are you going to get more and more negative with each phone call? IT IS UP TO YOU!! </p><p> Starting this week, get into the habit of feeding your mind and attitude daily with affirmations, by listening to motivational CD&rsquo;s, by reading two pages a day in a positive book, and by goal setting. If you haven&rsquo;t read books like, &ldquo;The Success Principles&rdquo; by Jack Canfield, or &ldquo;Beyond Positive Thinking&rdquo; by Dr. Robert Anthony, then go to Amazon and order them today.</p><p> An all time favorite of mine is an 8 minute DVD I&rsquo;ve watched over and over on my lap top called: &ldquo;Finish Strong&rdquo; by Dan Green and can be found at their website: www.simpletruths.com That book/DVD alone will be a great investment in your attitude.</p><h3> 2) Sharpen Your Sales Skills <br/>  </h3><p> Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; there is no room for error in today&rsquo;s competitive sales environment. Sloppy sales presentations, poorly qualified leads, and just plain lazy and bad habits are going to make you miserable in your job. You must, and I mean must, learn, practice and use effective sales techniques that will allow you to identify buyers and then deliver effective presentations to close business.</p><p> The Top 20% will do well because they already use effective skills and spend time getting better, but the bottom 80% are going to sink like a stone. I&rsquo;d say that up to one quarter of all sales reps will lose their jobs in the next 12 months because they won&rsquo;t improve enough to make it in this environment.</p><p> What are YOU doing now to improve your skills each day? Obviously there are many things that will work for you, but one of the easiest and least expensive ways to do that is to go to Amazon.com and pick up a copy of my book, &ldquo;The Real Secrets of the Top 20% &ndash; How To Double Your Income Selling Over the Phone.&rdquo; It&rsquo;ll be the best $14 bucks you&rsquo;ll send this year&hellip;</p><h3> 3) Start Listening To Your Prospects <br/>  </h3><p> Now more than ever, it&rsquo;s crucially important that you learn how to connect with your prospects and show them you really care about what they&rsquo;re going through and what their needs are. 80% of your competition is going to pitch and pitch and pitch, and this turns off the people they are trying to sell. The Top 20% take the time to understand the difficulties their prospects and clients are going through and they find ways to help them. And it all begins with listening.</p><p> People are going to buy from people they like, know or trust, and the best way to build this rapport is by asking questions and actually listening to their answers. I&rsquo;ve written many articles on listening skills, and you can read them in my Blog, or invest in my book and read successful techniques that will help you become a better listener. But whatever you do, you must begin showing your prospects you care, and best way to do that is by listening.</p><p> Trust me when I tell you that these three simple rules are the bedrock of success in sales. Eighty percent of your competition won&rsquo;t do these things, but if you will, you will smoke them in sales. In fact, you can become a Top 5% or even a Top 1% producer if you will just take the time to make these rules daily habits.</p><p> Remember &ndash; first we form habits and then they form us.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 15:12:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 15:12:27.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_mesOjWH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/work-in-sales-start-these-steps-this-week-to-sharpen-your-skills/\", \"post_id\": \"10937\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 15:12:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 15:12:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"work-in-sales-start-these-steps-this-week-to-sharpen-your-skills\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10936\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5338\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Work-in-Sales-Start-These-Steps-This-Week-to-Sharpen-Your-Skills.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"534\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462899600,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

These companies are growing at an insane pace (which is a good thing!), and freelance resources are the perfect addition to help businesses scale accordingly and manage growth.</p><p> On the flip side, freelance resources are extremely helpful in catapulting growth for small and medium-sized businesses. These experts can focus on areas critical to a business&rsquo;s growth and help advise leadership on where to prioritize resources.</p><p> Here are five benefits to have a freelance resource to skyrocket your business: </p><h3> Flexibility: Shift Resources Without Losing Focus</h3><p> One of the most rewarding pieces of a freelance resource is their ability to be flexible. When a business is just starting or launching new initiatives, priorities can change based on market reception, and freelancers build their business on that notion so they can provide you the services you need. Flexibility is built into a freelancer&rsquo;s business model for this very reason.</p><h3> Expertise</h3><p> Every freelance resource has a focus and expertise. If you&rsquo;re looking for a digital market expert, a freelance agency staffs itself with seasoned freelance consultants in that field. A successful freelance resource comes in knowing what your business needs and how to get there, guiding the rest of your team towards reaching your organization&rsquo;s goals.</p><h3> Cost-Saving</h3><p> Along with expertise and flexibility, freelancers are much more cost-efficient than hiring a full-time resource. Say goodbye to on-boarding, training, and administrative tasks that hold up productivity. Part of a freelancer&rsquo;s job is to dive in on execution once they understand a business&rsquo;s mission, needs, and goals &ndash; delivering you instant return on your investment.</p><h3> Ready For The Unpredictable</h3><p> While flexibility is a key trait for freelancers to help businesses grow, it&rsquo;s also necessary for the unpredictable. Say your business loses a client, or brings on a new client with needs you haven&rsquo;t yet built out processes for. A freelancer can come in with the structure needed for both instances.</p><p> Business News Daily interviewed Steve Dongo, managing director at The Plato Group, on this very notion and he talked about how freelance consultants were key in managing these types of situations for his business:</p><p> &ldquo;As a business owner I can speak from experience when I say business demands can suddenly decrease or increase, often depending on external factors we cannot always influence, such as the success or setback of competitors or a client.&rdquo;</p><h3> Results</h3><p> Freelancers measure themselves on expectations and delivering results, so businesses know exactly what they&rsquo;re paying for and what they&rsquo;re getting in return. A successful freelance resource won&rsquo;t leave any question or confusion as to what your business is getting from their services &ndash; what&rsquo;s most important is getting your business to hit growth and revenue goals.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 15:20:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 15:20:52.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_rrEtQv4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/proven-digital-strategies-to-increase-leads-drive-online-traffic-and-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"10939\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 15:20:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 15:20:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"proven-digital-strategies-to-increase-leads-drive-online-traffic-and-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10938\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5339\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Proven-Digital-Strategies-to-Increase-Leads-Drive-Online-Traffic-and-Sales.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"366\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462870800,"author_id":438,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5136,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Get Serious About Estate Planning When Your Spouse Doesn't Want To","link":"how-to-get-serious-about-estate-planning-when-your-spouse-doesnt-want-to","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Supposedly, the most frightening words one spouse can hear from the other are, &ldquo;Honey, we need to talk.&rdquo; Even more frightening, however, is, &ldquo;Honey, we need to talk about estate planning.&rdquo;</p><p> What can you do if you want to get serious about estate planning, but your spouse doesn&rsquo;t? </p><p> Here are a few suggestions:</p><h3> 1. Consider ways to persuade a reluctant spouse to participate</h3><p> First, give up nagging. In my years of financial planning, I&rsquo;ve seen how ineffective it is from either an advisor or a spouse.</p><p> Instead, it might be worthwhile to do some research and show your spouse some of the specific consequences of not planning. Depending on the complexity of your circumstances, you may find it worthwhile to consult an attorney, accountant, or financial advisor. You can also find a great deal of helpful information, such as state probate and intestacy laws, online.</p><p> If you have no wills, find out how your state laws distribute assets when someone dies without a will. Show your spouse how that distribution would affect your family. In many cases, intestacy laws are still designed around a traditional one-marriage-with-children family structure. They may fail to provide for members of families that don&rsquo;t fit that mold&mdash;for example, by disregarding stepchildren and stepgrandchildren.</p><p> If you have wills but made them years ago, take a close look at their provisions. Show your spouse&mdash;with numbers, if you can&mdash;exactly who would benefit and who would not. Your spouse may be persuaded to take action if he or she sees the specific ways that yesterday&rsquo;s wills don&rsquo;t provide for today&rsquo;s family. Even if this accomplishes nothing beyond convincing your spouse to destroy an outdated will, it may be worthwhile. An outdated will, in some cases, can be worse than none at all.</p><p> It&rsquo;s quite likely that neither of these approaches will succeed. This leaves you with the next-best option.</p><h3> 2. Do what you can on your own</h3><p> With your own separate property, you can do any estate planning you want, including executing a will and setting up a living trust. I would also strongly encourage you to execute powers of attorney for financial and health decisions.</p><p> However, you might be surprised at the limits on estate planning for assets you consider yours. One important provision is that married people cannot name anyone except each other as beneficiaries on retirement plans without the spouse&rsquo;s permission. Suppose, for example, you would like to name your children from a previous marriage as beneficiaries on a retirement account as a way of providing fairly for them if your spouse died intestate. You would need your spouse&rsquo;s consent to do so.</p><p> Also, a will executed by one spouse does not affect assets held jointly or in trust, annuities, retirement plans, or individually held bank or brokerage accounts that have a TOD (transfer on death) provision.</p><p> Assuming you cannot persuade your spouse to participate in estate planning, and assuming you have done whatever individual planning you can, there&rsquo;s one more step you can take.</p><h3> 3. Educate yourself</h3><p> Do your best to create and maintain a complete inventory of assets you and your spouse hold jointly, as well as your separate retirement accounts, insurance policies, and other individual assets. Include account locations, approximate balances, and access information. Having this information will be invaluable if you end up as the administrator of your spouse&rsquo;s estate.</p><p> Ironically, the person who benefits most from your separate estate planning may be your non-planning spouse. Yet doing whatever you can will also help you be prepared, just in case you need to deal with the consequences of your spouse&rsquo;s lack of planning.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 15:34:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 15:34:04.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_mlnf1Wi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-serious-about-estate-planning-when-your-spouse-doesnt-want-to/\", \"post_id\": \"10941\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 15:34:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 15:34:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-serious-about-estate-planning-when-your-spouse-doesnt-want-to\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10940\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5340\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Get-Serious-About-Estate-Planning-When-Your-Spouse-Doesnt-Want-to.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"833\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462892400,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

With them, comes debilitating chronic conditions and extended lives. The need for specialized long-term support soars and demands significant provisions on health care. As it stands today, Americans lack adequate home and community-based services. They depend on the state governments to satisfy the need. However, insufficient care ranks high throughout the country.</p><p> In 2014, a study by AARP, <a href=\"http://www.longtermscorecard.org/2014-scorecard#.VyyxBPkrIdW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Long-Term Care Services, and Support Scorecard </a> found that local communities hold the key for improved healthcare, but not all states are equal.

If your newspaper doesn't hyperlink to the report, go online and search \"AARP Long-term Care Services and Support Scorecard.\"</p><p> Because many states have few alternatives; consumers rely on costly nursing homes, putting extra pressure on resources. But the best performing States offer nursing support at home instead of expensive skilled nursing home care.</p><p> In the worst performing States, close to 25 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries receive care in their homes and communities. And in the best-performing ones, 75 percent do. The best performing States transitioned close to 15 percent of people from nursing homes back to their community (within three months of hospital visit) while the poorer performers transferred only 5 percent.</p><h3> Public policies needed: <br/>  </h3><p> Consumers need home and community-based choices and the option to hire the people to help.</p><p> Better manage the unnecessary transitions between nursing homes and hospitals, which disrupt recovery and add pressures on resources.</p><p> Best care states: Minnesota is number 1. New York ranks 25, Texas 30, and Kentucky the lowest. Find out how your state ranks. Nursing home costs: The four affordable states are Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Missouri; the least are Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and New York.</p><p> Older adults find that home care allows them to stretch their dollars further, but overall, long-term care outpaces affordability for middle-income families. It's imperative that we fight for more home and community-based services to decrease costs, especially for those who cannot afford to pay for support services in a nursing home.

{"original_id":5138,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Have You Thought About What Your Organisation's Three Voices Are Saying?","link":"have-you-thought-about-what-your-organisations-three-voices-are-saying","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This month we are turning our focus to research and listening to customers&rsquo; voices. </p><p> But, of course, the customer is not necessarily the only voice to which you should be listening as an insight leader.</p><p> So, to set a context for the rest of our research content this month, I&rsquo;m delighted to welcome Richard Kimber as a new guest blogger.</p><p> Richard is a Customer Experience Improvement Specialist at Custerian. In his first post for us, he shares on the importance of you listening to three voices.</p><h3> Over to Richard to explain&hellip;</h3><p> Many years ago, I used to work in an organisation, where the MD&rsquo;s mantra (one of them anyway) was &ldquo;what gets measured gets done&rdquo; and to a degree he&rsquo;s right.</p><p> However, businesses, especially large organisations, are great at measuring lots of things. Lots of things that in part they&rsquo;ve always measured and forgot why they started in the first place. Or have lots of manual reporting because systems and processes don&rsquo;t support what&rsquo;s needed, if in fact it&rsquo;s needed at all.</p><p> With all the talk around big data, and the amount of actual data that&rsquo;s available and can be reported on, cutting through the data noise is difficult. However, there is a need and a desire to focus on the critical few measures that really make a difference both within the organisation and to the customer.</p><p> There&rsquo;s also a difference between what&rsquo;s important for the organisation to measure and understand about internal performance versus external performance with customers and other stakeholders , such as regulators.</p><p> We see clients that have a lot of measures in place that generate a lot of data, but not necessarily the right measures in the right place on the right things, that would otherwise give them intelligence into both their own process performance, and their customer experiences.</p><p> As an example, I spoke to an Insurance company last year, who only found out that they&rsquo;d not sent out 10,000 renewal letters when the customer complaint flood gate opened! A reactive situation with little or no control, which sucks resource and creates additional cost, not to mention customer dissatisfaction and negative emotion.</p><h3> So what&rsquo;s the answer?</h3><p> Well, one approach is what we talk about at Custerian. We talk about measuring the three voices in an organisation.</p><p> These three voices are:</p><li> Voice of Customer (VoC)</li><li> Voice of Process (VoP)</li><li> Voice of Employee (VoE)</li><h3> Voice of Customer</h3><p> This is exactly as it sounds! It&rsquo;s the voice of the customer measured (or listened to) either formally and structured through customer research and measurement, or informal and unstructured through anecdotes, employee feedback, social media comments and shares (or even thank you notes!).</p><h3> Voice of Process</h3><p> These are what most people refer to as KPIs (key performance indicators). However, they need to be measuring key parts of processes that deliver or determine an important or critical part of the customer experience. A key question to ask here is &ldquo;if a process point fails will it cause adverse impact to customers, create complaints and/or customer dissatisfaction, or detract from the total experience? If the answer is yes, then it needs to be measured. I&rsquo;d suggest that insurance renewal letters fall in this category. An easy one with hindsight but a key part of the insurance renewal process where failure causes adverse impact.</p><h3> Voice of employee</h3><p> Simply, where a process hands off between team or individuals, the hand off should be measured to ensure;</p><p> The handing-off team complete their part efficiently and effectively and on time <br/> The receiving team get everything they need to be able to complete their part efficiently and effectively to either finish the process or hand over again as required</p><h3> Rinse and repeat</h3><p> If you then have a single view i.e. a dashboard with all 3 voices on it, then you can see all three critical measures in one place, at a glance without having to dig around for the information on a regular basis.</p><p> Further refinement to this is setting tolerance thresholds around the three voices. So that if VoP or VoE drops out of threshold, you can with a degree of certainty, predict that there will be an impact on VoC.</p><p> The real skill, is to be able to quickly spot the drops in VoP and VoE and correct them before VoC is actually impacted (ideally). Now we&rsquo;re starting to delve into the world of real time analytics and reporting which is for another post but is already (and has been for a while) available.</p><p> It&rsquo;s part of moving from reactive (slow) to predictive (agile) and creating intentional experiences for customers (and organisations), rather than the reactive fix and fire fight that we continually see.</p><p> Looking back at the Insurance company example from earlier, there clearly was no VoP measure on renewal letters&hellip; If the measure had been in place, they would have spotted the failure and been able to correct and inform probably before customers had even realised. This is where big data can be a distraction when there&rsquo;s more effective things that can be done first to protect and improve the customer experience.</p><p> What would your organisation&rsquo;s three voices be saying?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 15:52:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 15:52:01.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_wv05Ynz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/have-you-thought-about-what-your-organisations-three-voices-are-saying/\", \"post_id\": \"10945\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 15:52:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 15:52:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"have-you-thought-about-what-your-organisations-three-voices-are-saying\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10944\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5342\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Have-You-Thought-About-What-Your-Organisations-Three-Voices-Are-Saying.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"597\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462906800,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5139,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Guilty of These Crimes Getting You Interrupted, Ignored and Micromanaged?","link":"are-you-guilty-of-these-crimes-getting-you-interrupted-ignored-and-micromanaged","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I have many clients (especially female) who come to me because they aren&rsquo;t taken seriously at work. They report that they&rsquo;re very often interrupted in meetings. They frequently stay quiet when they have brilliant ideas to share.  </p><p> Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant wrote a fantastic article called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/opinion/sunday/speaking-while-female.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  Speaking While Female </a> . They reported anecdotal and scientific evidence that when males speak in the workplace they&rsquo;re regarded as more competent and when women speak they&rsquo;re often disliked and/or considered aggressive. They concluded that there&rsquo;s a bias against women in the workplace. There may well be.</p><p> But there are things that we can do to put an absolute end to interruptions and micromanagement. It&rsquo;s probable that things that we are doing are encouraging interruptions and micromanagement. Yes I said it. I was scared to say it. But I have 20 years of data to back it up. Read on.</p><h3> <strong>  Case Study 1: The Bi*@h </strong></h3><p> <br/> Part of my work involves going into corporations and helping entire teams to communicate more successfully with each other and with their clients.  In one particular firm I worked with the president of marketing and her team.  I worked with each person individually, and each of the team members reported that their boss was the B word. men &amp; women. No kidding. They all thought she was condescending and a B#@*h. Which she wasn&rsquo;t. She was a kind person who wanted the best for her team &amp; her firm.</p><p> The president, let&rsquo;s call her Sandy, was also being interrupted by her boss. He wasn&rsquo;t letting her finish a sentence. I solved both problems in no time flat.  Sandy was hanging on to the end of each phrase that she spoke. She was actually trying to be nice. Lot&rsquo;s of people do it.  </p><p> Read this aloud: Hi Guuuuuuuuuysssss. How&rsquo;s it going with your proooooojjeeeect?</p><p> Intention: Don&rsquo;t want to be bossy; want to come across as sweet and kind.</p><p> Result: Bi*@h</p><p> What&rsquo;s the solution?</p><p> Always shorten the last syllable of your phrases. Which I trained Sandy to do in no time flat. We gave her a persuasive, authoritative warm style.</p><h3> <strong>  Case Study 2: The Micromanagee </strong></h3><p> <br/> I had a client at a fortune 1000 company who reported to the CEO. She reported that he micromanaged her. We were roleplaying a meeting she was to have the next day with her CEO and she said: &ldquo;um this is just an initial raw draft.&rdquo;  &ldquo;just&rdquo; &ldquo;initial&rdquo; &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and &ldquo;draft&rdquo; all mean the same thing. Talk about coming across as afraid, insecure and not the highly intelligent powerhouse that she was.</p><p> So we had her saying, &ldquo;Hi [boss], here&rsquo;s my draft, geta look &amp; lemme know what you think.&rdquo; He stopped micromanaging her shortly thereafter. After she began using plain, active language, with concise breath groups.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the deal.  If we come across as insecure why would our superiors at work not feel the need to micromanage us? I suppose there are just natural micromanagers out there but in the 20 years I&rsquo;ve been doing this 98.9% have been stopped!</p><h3> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the Solution? </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is a bit more complicated because insecurity doesn&rsquo;t just disappear with a quick tip. We can do it, though, with a bit of determination and time.</p><li> You must record yourself. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Every single amazing communicator out there has worked on their communication skills.</li><li> Listen to that recording. Assess yourself like a scientist.  You take a baseline. Count the undermining words you use.</li><li> Formulate your message into short, concise active language. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Case Study 3: The Interrupted </strong></h3><p> <br/> This client is a composite of many, many clients who&rsquo;ve come to me because they&rsquo;re being interrupted in meetings. This is a very stressful time for these gorgeous, talented women. They&rsquo;re even beginning to devalue their own worth. But I&rsquo;m not a psychologist so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p><p> Here are the symptoms: Run on sentences and over-emphasis of connector words. I kid you not. Let&rsquo;s try to show this in print. Read the following aloud:</p><p> So i have an idea in order to get the margins up we should do some testing in xyz area aaaaaand then we can try 123 aaaaand see if the numbers go up aaaaaaand if they don&rsquo;t we could&hellip;.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the problem with this? Your listener&rsquo;s processing skills. They are unable to process the information after a few sentences. Interrupting is rude but interrupters obviously haven&rsquo;t taken my class. Once they do they&rsquo;ll know how to deal with that, too. I digress.</p><p> We can try to train people to stop interrupting; we can also train people to speak in a way that&rsquo;s authoritative yet warm, concise and exciting. We need to train people to listen and understand better. I&rsquo;m a Speech Language Pathologist studying communication skills since I was a kid and I still train to listen, understand &amp; communicate better.</p><p> I take some of the blame off the interrupters and put it on the speakers. Just like when you go into a presentation excited to hear the topic and your mind is wandering within minutes. You&rsquo;re blaming yourself: &ldquo;I have no attention span anymore!&rdquo; Guess what? It&rsquo;s the speaker&rsquo;s fault. But that&rsquo;s another story.</p><p> Look. You&rsquo;re a great communicator. You&rsquo;re smart and you tell great stories in the regular milieus of your life. People listen to you and do what you say. But during anxiety-ridden situations (meetings, presentations, interviews, arguments, anytime you want something from the situation) your skills deflate. Yup. No one&rsquo;s immune.</p><p> Do you wanna know why we can&rsquo;t be as confident, concise, and influential as we are in easier situations? Because our brains haven&rsquo;t yet evolved to communicate in a crystal clear persuasive fashion during stressful situations. I don&rsquo;t care who you are. When you&rsquo;re chatting with your close confidant about your skills and your experiences you come across as more credible more authoritative, smarter than you do when you&rsquo;re in an anxiety ridden situation.</p><p> Are you a bit nervous during meetings? If you say &ldquo;no&rdquo; I might suggest you&rsquo;re in denial. We all have some nervousness when called to speak in front of others. We literally go into fight or flight mode and we lose our connection with our brain.   </p><h3> <strong>  Change the bits you can control </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s change this together! Send this article to all of your friends and colleagues who suffer from interruptions and micromanagement.</p><p> Learn relaxation exercises. I&rsquo;ve got some great ones. You need to be so relaxed you could fall asleep.  And that&rsquo;s what you need to be during every communicative situation. What?!!! I&rsquo;m not supposed to be on red alert? No. Comfy cozy is the answer to your problems. Fearlessness is the result of complete relaxation.</p><p> Use a full, warm voice with concise sentences. Let air come out when you speak. Don&rsquo;t hold your breath, people!</p><p> Get your intonation right. Don&rsquo;t go up in pitch at the end and don&rsquo;t hang on to the last syllable. Make your connector words really short&ndash;even better eliminate them. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-09 15:59:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-09 15:59:41.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_q0Pmjch.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-guilty-of-these-crimes-getting-you-interrupted-ignored-and-micromanaged/\", \"post_id\": \"10947\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-09 15:59:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-09 15:59:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-guilty-of-these-crimes-getting-you-interrupted-ignored-and-micromanaged\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10946\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5343\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Are-You-Guilty-of-These-Crimes-Getting-You-Interrupted-Ignored-and-Micromanaged.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"786\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462903200,"author_id":202,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5140,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Future of Love","link":"the-future-of-love","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Although we still get butterflies, the way we find and interact with the loves in our lives has been changed dramatically. From Skype, virtual and robotic sex, and all kinds of dating apps, our love live has gone digital.</p><p> Jump forward another twenty years, and our digital love lives will have changed once again. Here are three technological developments that may enhance love in the future: </p><h3> <strong>  Emotion Chip </strong></h3><p> <br/> Picture this: You&rsquo;re meeting your date and you start to smile that crazy smile of infatuation, gesture more like you&rsquo;re still a teenager, and your voice goes up a notch. All these changes will get noted by the smart devices that surround you, and they will start to adapt to your new emotional state.</p><p> Spotify will change its tune to a romantic one. The lighting adjusts to show you off at your best. The heating sets itself ever so slightly warmer. Your clothes shift shape towards an almost unnoticeably sexier design. Your kitchen starts to chill the wine and spits out some tasty nibbles. Your sports program gets postponed, and your walls and ceiling show an ocean view with a distant sunset&hellip;</p><p> And this is just the start. Because smart devices will learn over time. They will match your emotional states and favored responses to thousands of patterns online. New devices can tap into this knowledge instantly, as it&rsquo;s hosted in the cloud.</p><p> As we speak (2016), about 6.5 billion devices are connected to the Internet. That&rsquo;s a 30% increase from 2015. The big research agencies project a growth rate of 280% of connected devices in 2020. </p><p> More and more devices are being fitted with optical and audio sensors to monitor your emotional state. The only real big thing is the intelligence those devices need to develop to leave you in peace: at this point, they clutch you at your knees like a needy toddler and start to bleep their messages, wanted or not.</p><h3> <strong>  Brain Uploads </strong></h3><p> <br/> Picture this: you just met your new love, and he is really into martial arts. What better way to get to know him, than to put on a good fight. The only problem is, the closest you get to a kung-fu move is the kick you deal when the cooky jar doesn&rsquo;t want to part from its lid. But not anymore. Because you can upload kung-fu skills directly to your brain.</p><p> Recently, an experiment was done with the ability to fly a plane. the brain activity of professional pilots was analyzed and patterns of electrical stimulation were designed to emulate it. People who had never flown a plane before got a cap on their head with electrodes to stimulate the precise brain areas that the pilots had used. Then they were asked to join a flight simulation as a pilot. They competed with a group who had no brain stimulation. And the remarkable result: the stimulated group outperformed the nonstimulated group by over 34%.</p><p> When you learn a new skill, new neural paths develop. The researchers are looking to replicate those paths in unskilled brains. We&rsquo;re only at the beginning of understanding specific neural pathways and patterns, but progress is fast.</p><h3> <strong>  Touchy Feely </strong></h3><p> <br/> The good thing about all this technology is when it enhances our abilities and skills to a level that helps us to interact with others in a constructive way. </p><p> When you think about it, the best thing about all this tech is when it helps people with severe disabilities to (re)capture a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life. To have real feeling in prosthetic limbs and to experience touch even when paralyzed. </p><p> Presently, electrical wires in prosthetics are attached to pressure and grip sensors on the one hand, and to nerves at the other. This means that a prosthetic limb passes information to the brain about the surface you touch and how much pressure you need to exert, or is exerted on you. </p><p> Brain implants can already read electrical activity in the brain and turn that information into action. External robotic skeletons or prosthetic limbs can perform actions and in their turn inform the brain about the feeling of that action. That&rsquo;s huge when you&rsquo;re talking about making love.</p><p> While prosthetics, exoskeletons, and brain implants still look clumsy or fake, advances in cosmetic surgery, humanoid robotics, and new materials are moving rapidly towards a life like experience of skin, muscles, and bone. It&rsquo;s a matter of time before we won&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference between a natural and an artificial experience.</p><h3> <strong>  The Good, the Bad, and the Lovely </strong></h3><p> <br/> How these technologies will affect our society is hard to predict. However, futurists think that we will want to control our environment and lives more and more. We want to think we&rsquo;re the master of the world. Literally. Because we experiment with genetics and artificial biology. We can create new plants and other life-forms by tinkering with DNA and even invent new DNA. It&rsquo;s quite possible that more humanoid species will wander the world once again. With different levels of inbred technologies.</p><h3> <strong>  The Good </strong></h3><p> <br/> People with several physical disabilities will be able to hear, see, feel, move just like people without. We will achieve a level playing field at last.</p><h3> <strong>  The Bad </strong></h3><p> <br/> Not everyone will have access to new technology. The gap between rich and poor will manifest itself in new ways. Inequality scares me. It&rsquo;s one of the causes of unrest and upheaval for the have-nots. And one of the causes for wanting repressive measures at the other end. I wouldn&rsquo;t want inequality to grow: people without access will truly stand outside the society, increasing the odds of violence. In that scenario, technology may be used in bad ways: without your consent, to monitor your thought, change your skills, and mutate your loved ones.</p><h3> <strong>  The Lovely </strong></h3><p> <br/> Will an overload of technology make us go Amish? I don&rsquo;t think so. We just have a hard time envisioning a situation in which we need that technology. Like in the late 1990s, when we felt that a cellphone was the last thing we needed. Imagine.

Behavioral Coaching: 1.50% (or more) </strong></h3><p> <br/> Managing client behavior in challenging markets &ndash; and adhering to the long-term financial plan you've set out for them is a critical part of your value. &ldquo;Periods of significant underperformance can undermine your client&rsquo;s trust in you,&rdquo; says the report.</p><p> As the market gyrates, trusted Uncle Harry may have told your client that he lost a bunch of money when the stock market last tanked.

Telomeres are the DNA-protein structures located like caps at the ends of chromosomes. They shorten with aging and may also be a marker of biological, not chronological, aging. They are believed to be involved in protecting the chromosome from inflammation and various stressors. In some studies, their diminishing length has been associated with diabetes and atherosclerosis.</p><p> I found one of these studies particularly interesting. In the study, 154 individuals aged 45 to 77 participated. The study demonstrated that poor sleepers, as defined by poor sleep quality or short duration (less than 7 hours per night), had significantly shorter telomere length. Even more interesting was the finding that in the older adults, adequate sleep was associated with telomere lengths comparable to middle-aged adults. The authors concluded that the study provides evidence that sleep is linked to cellular aging.</p><p> If this were the only study published on sleep and telomere length it would not be worth writing about, but it&rsquo;s not. There have been several other studies demonstrating the relationship of sleep to telomere length. In another study published in in the journalRespiratory Medicine, persons with untreated sleep apnea were found to have shortened telomeres, too.</p><p> We know that telomeres shorten with aging. We also know that they shorten in response to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress.

The Answer Is 'Yes' You Do","link":"do-you-need-to-stalk-your-clients-the-answer-is-yes-you-do","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Let me talk you through one of my favourite movie scenes in recent times. In doing so, I&rsquo;m going to share with you a marketing technique that could quite possibly double your lead flow and cost you pennies.</p><p> It&rsquo;s that powerful.</p><p> The scene is from the recent Will Smith movie Focus. It&rsquo;s called the &rsquo;55&rsquo; scene.</p><p> After a series of foolish bets with jetset Chinese millionaire at an NFL game, Smith&rsquo;s character makes his most foolhardy move. He&rsquo;s $1.1m in the hole, but his anger drives him to stake double or nothing.</p><p> His opponent can choose any football player in the stadium, simply choosing a number. Smith then has to guess the number cold.</p><p> That&rsquo;s over a hundred possibilities, with only one right answer.</p><p> The jetsetter says no. Will sweetens the deal. He&rsquo;s not even going to be the one guessing. That responsibility will fall to his sports-agnostic female partner.</p><p> It&rsquo;s anger-fuelled madness. The Chinese millionaire reluctantly accepts.</p><p> Of course the jetsetter picks 55, Margot Robbie picks 55 blind. They clean their opponent out and, in the car trip back to the airport, Smith reveals the mechanism of the subterfuge.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s been an exercise in subconscious messaging.</h3><p> <br/> All throughout the day the jetsetter has been seeing the number 55. On his room key, walking down the hall, on the t-shirts of people walking by. Even the music in the background &ndash; Rolling Stones Sympathy for the Devil &ndash; has been primed. The chorus &ldquo;woo-woo&rdquo; happens to sound like the Cantonese for 55.</p><p> The jetsetter has been primed, triggered to choose the number 55 by numerous, consistent messages present but not always fully noticed.</p><p> I think something similar may have happened to you.</p><p> It may be that time you visited a certain website. It might have been when you went to buy something on Amazon but decided not to. Or perhaps you were checking out how much tickets were for the next Tony Robbins event but chose to leave and think about it.</p><p> Whatever it was, you checked something out, made the decision not to buy on the spot and went about your merry way.</p><p> Then something odd happened. You started to notice adverts for this thing on a number of different websites you visited, manifested as banner adverts and other reminders in your line of sight.</p><p> &ldquo;Wow&rdquo;, you may have thought. &ldquo;They must be spending some serious marketing dollars&rdquo;</p><p> The truth is quite the opposite.</p><p> What happened is in that moment you were visiting that original site, a small piece of code was added to your computer. Much like a traffic warden marking your car tyre with chalk, your interest was noted.</p><p> From that point on, Google or Facebook applied it&rsquo;s marketing muscles to sell advertising space on the websites you later visited with the aim of reminding you of your original interest.</p><p> You were stalked around the web, and each time you saw that advert you were gently reminded of your initial interest.</p><p> The best bit is this whole process wound up being fairly inexpensive for the company who wanted your business.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a process called Remarketing and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s talk about why it matters to your advice business. It boils down to the fact that most decisions to get advice don&rsquo;t happen in an instant. <br/>  </h3><p> Sure, some of your prospects may wake up to the need to do something different in managing their financial affairs quickly and easily. Some are hurting so much with their problems they really have little choice.</p><p> For most though, it might take days. Possibly weeks. All too frequently it&rsquo;s not until years later the tipping point is reached.</p><p> Perhaps the catalyst for prospects suddenly realising that doing nothing is not the answer may be later contact from your business.</p><p> Maybe you reach out to them a few times a year. Finally at the seventh or eighth attempt your latest newsletter, blog or LinkedIn post triggers the decision reaction.</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s a phone call, or chance meeting at the gym.</p><p> Perhaps it&rsquo;s something a friend of theirs says one day that has nothing to do with your marketing efforts.</p><p> Finally, they engage.</p><p> The downside however might be months have passed before this happens. The power of compounding (in Einstein&rsquo;s appreciation of it) has become a little less powerful. It has made your longer-term job slightly less simple.</p><p> What if you could speed the whole process up, initiating the same number of touchpoints in a fraction of the time, without the manual marketing work required to make it happen?</p><p> That&rsquo;s the power of retargeting and why you as an advice business, if you have even a half decent web presence, need to get on it.</p><p> When a prospect visits your website, they are responding to a need.</p><p> When they leave, they are relegating that need back into a state of procrastination. It isn&rsquo;t dead, merely on hold, ready to be reactivated.</p><p> By employing retargeting, you have the chance to cheaply trigger the opportunity for them to come back in a far shorter space of time than your manual marketing could possibly.</p><p> You still need to make sure you have a compelling offer and strong value story &ndash; this won&rsquo;t work if you&rsquo;re weak in these areas &ndash; but this is just one of a number of ways technology and digital marketing present fresh opportunities for helping advisers find less labour intensive ways to attract more great clients to their business.</p><p> It&rsquo;s one of a number of topic areas I&rsquo;m helping advice firms embrace and get ROI from as part of our The Leveraged Advice Firm coaching program. We&rsquo;ll even be going as far as building the campaigns for our clients. It&rsquo;s that kind of program.</p><p> Client referrals and strategic partnerships remain avenues that no advice firm should ignore if they want to grow. However, when you&rsquo;ve got an already-strained workload and you&rsquo;re facing a noisy marketing and media mix, if you&rsquo;re not looking at smart opportunities like this, enabled by technological innovation, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the strain of keeping your funnel filled will begin to tell.</p><p> Why wouldn&rsquo;t you let the tech do the hard work?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 15:12:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 15:12:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_J3owOUU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-need-to-stalk-your-clients-the-answer-is-yes-you-do/\", \"post_id\": \"10953\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 15:12:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 15:12:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-need-to-stalk-your-clients-the-answer-is-yes-you-do\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10952\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5353\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-You-Need-to-Stalk-Your-Clients-The-Answer-Is-Yes-You-Do.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"766\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462960800,"author_id":456,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5144,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Ways Leaders Can Have a Healthy Relationship with Failure","link":"6-ways-leaders-can-have-a-healthy-relationship-with-failure","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you want to succeed as a leader, get comfortable with failing.</p><p> This concept is a whole lot easier said than done. Platitudes abound in organisations about the learning arising from failure. And yet, when push comes to shove, many organisational cultures demonstrate a serious preoccupation with success. Add the short term (often myopic) focus on bottom line results and it&rsquo;s no wonder failing gets a hard rap in most companies.</p><p> This leadership approach has serious limitations:</p><li> Not allowing a certain degree of failure in your organisation impedes learning opportunities.</li><li> It kills creative thinking.</li><li> It prevents a growth mind-set.</li><li> And, it exposes you to being blindsided by your competitors, because you didn&rsquo;t take risks. <br/>  </li><p> Think about anything you&rsquo;ve ever mastered in your life, like riding a bike for starters. You failed, you fell over and you floundered long before you reached mastery.</p><p> Anything important you&rsquo;ve discovered about yourself, others or your world probably followed a botch-up of some kind or another.</p><p> Why would it be any different in the world of business?</p><p> According to new research from a pair of economists from Stanford and the University of Michigan (Francine Lafontaine and Kathryn Shaw), failed entrepreneurs are far more likely to be successful in their second go-around, provided they try again.</p><p> It&rsquo;s what we do with failure when it happens, that counts.</p><h3> Here are 6 ways leaders can have a healthy relationship with failure: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. When mistakes happen, change your response <br/>  </h3><p> Instead of reacting with anger or frustration &ndash; or worse yet, going on a witch hunt &ndash; ask, &ldquo;What did we just learn?&rdquo; Non-judgemental, inquisitive and curious is the vibe you want to channel when it comes to stuff-ups.</p><p> Failure can teach us not only what we are doing wrong, but how to do it right the next time. There are a myriad of reasons behind a failure (just as there is with success). Your focus should be determining whether the failure was due to process, people or something else.</p><h3> 2. De stigmatise failure (especially first time failures) by being loud and vocal about the learnings that failure affords <br/>  </h3><p> Formally support learning from mistakes by instigating regular reflection and review of projects, especially using data-driven approaches.</p><h3> 3. Structure projects to allow some experimentation (and therefore normalise failure) <br/>  </h3><p> &lsquo;Ooch&rsquo;, as Heath and Heath espouse in their book, Decisive. &lsquo;Oooching&rsquo; allows you to run little experiments to test your theories. Rather than jumping into an initiative boots&rsquo;n all, we dip our toes in. This way, the inevitable failures won&rsquo;t bring the company down in one fell swoop. Rather, &lsquo;ooching&rsquo; lowers the impact of mistakes at the same time, bringing you the upsides and insights associated with experiments.</p><h3> 4. Adopt a growth mindset towards yourself and those you lead <br/>  </h3><p> Carol Dweck&rsquo;s research is compelling. When giving praise, focus on effort, rather than intelligence. For example, &ldquo;I noticed you put a lot of effort into that project, well done.&rdquo; As opposed to &ndash; &ldquo;You did well, you&rsquo;re really good at these types of projects.&rdquo; Research shows people are more inclined to try new things when a growth mindset is adopted i.e. praising for effort. Conversely, people stay within their comfort zones when praised for intelligence, rather than effort.</p><h3> 5. Model what you want to see in others <br/>  </h3><p> &lsquo;Failure tolerant&rsquo; leaders openly admit their own mistakes rather than covering them up or shifting the blame.  Developing a healthy and productive relationship with failure starts with self. If you see failure as an inherently bad thing, your teams will pick this up, regardless of what you say. Admit your goof-ups publicly (especially with those you lead) and highlight the insights and changes you will make as a result of those failures.</p><h3> 6. Tolerate failure but address repeated mistakes and patterns <br/>  </h3><p> Looking closely at the root cause of failure helps us to determine the &lsquo;good mistakes&rsquo; from the bad ones that we want to stamp out. The same mistake made over and over without course correction is another matter altogether. There&rsquo;s a mile between blatant sloppiness and a mistake made by trying something new. Seek to determine the difference by powerful questions and analysis of root causes through data and intuition.</p><p> Whilst no one I know genuinely enjoys failing or sets out to fail, it&rsquo;s healthy to accept it as an integral part of the process when aiming for a breakthrough.</p><p> As Richard Branson once said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t learn to walk by following rules.

{"original_id":5146,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Find More Effective (and Less Expensive) Legal Advice","link":"how-to-find-more-effective-and-less-expensive-legal-advice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/author/scottcalhoun/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Scott D. Calhoun </a></p><p> I am often called to consult with business owners about questions dealing with the structure or organization of their business entity. These questions typically involve issues related to:</p><li> The formation of the entity</li><li> Structure and relationships of co-owners</li><li> Continuity of the business</li><p> Although these issues can often be resolved favorably, a positive result may depend on when you call the lawyer.</p><p> Establishing a new business entity is normally a straightforward process, but the details are not to be taken lightly. Documents have to be prepared properly, signed appropriately and filed timely. Having competent counsel is important even for these basic procedures &ndash; just as investors benefit from a financial advisor&rsquo;s experience even when their goal is simply to invest in mutual funds. And timing can be just as important.</p><h3> Legal Advice: It&rsquo;s All in the Timing</h3><p> Timing is even more critical when addressing issues affecting the respective rights and obligations of business partners. More than once, I have had to deal with business partners wanting advice on how to deal with buy-sell or management dispute issues after a situation has developed. Waiting until the issue arises makes finding a mutually acceptable solution significantly more difficult.</p><p> The time to address these issues is up front. The business partners should consider how they will deal with the death of one of the partners, or with a decision by one of the partners to leave, or with designation of management responsibilities.</p><p> There are various alternatives for each of these issues, and decisions are much easier when made early on. The partners will be much more likely to be on the same page or in a mindset of finding agreement. If they wait until a problem arises, solutions are more difficult and the process can be hampered by history or a sense of a need to win.</p><p> The same considerations apply to issues affecting business succession and continuity. These issues may not arise at the time the business is being organized, but they deserve attention as early as they appear. Succession and continuity issues may impact management decisions &ndash; a company being positioned for sale to outsiders will be managed differently than one being groomed for family succession. Legal structures and transactions are integral to these decisions.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> What&rsquo;s my point here? Legal advice is more effective (and often much less expensive!) when the lawyer has the chance to deal with questions before the issues surface. That means the best time to call is when the company is formed, or when new partners are brought in, or when ownership begins discussing succession plans.</p><p> But no matter what, it&rsquo;s always better to call prior to circumstances developing into a dispute. Remember, your lawyer can be your friend before problems ever arise. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 15:22:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 15:22:39.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_kWCX85g.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-find-more-effective-and-less-expensive-legal-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"10959\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 15:22:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 15:22:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-find-more-effective-and-less-expensive-legal-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10958\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5356\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Find-More-Effective-and-Less-Expensive-Legal-Advice.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"384\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462986000,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}

And while strategic adjustments such as these aren&rsquo;t necessarily a new phenomenon &ndash; given every publicly traded firm&rsquo;s mandate to maximize shareholder value &ndash; today&rsquo;s regulatory climate coupled with an increasing cost of doing business has made for a more difficult operating environment.</p><p> As an example, a number of Wall Street firms revamped their international business units, with some opting out of the space altogether. After purchasing Merrill Lynch in 2009, Bank of America sold its off-shore wealth management offices to Julius Baer, and in August 2015 further narrowed the pool of international clients that its advisors would be able to service. RBC closed its Caribbean wealth management branches completely over 2 years ago and substantially reduced their international presence. And, ever tightening supervisory controls will be the order for any firm whose advisors service international clients, thus forcing many firms to reevaluate their continued interest in serving and supporting the space.</p><p> So, what are advisors to do when the firm they&rsquo;ve spent their entire career at makes a strategic decision that significantly limits their ability to service their clients and grow their business? Is the issue an industry problem? Does every firm want out of the international space or is it a matter of choice, firm by firm?</p><p> Some advisors &ndash; as a result of industry changes and more limitations placed upon them &ndash; will argue that adaptation is in order; these folks will accept their new reality, restructure their business and stay the course. Alternatively, many others will opt to leave their firm and find a home elsewhere&mdash;one that will be more welcoming of their business, and better equipped to support and grow it.</p><p> The real truth is that any employee advisor is vulnerable because they are subject to the ever-changing vision of their firm. Time and again, we&rsquo;ve witnessed one wirehouse take the lead on making a strategic policy change and in time, every other major firm follows suit. Pre-financial crisis, advisors would have had limited choices beyond remaining beholden to a bulge bracket firm with a big brand name. </p><p> Conversely, today&rsquo;s greatly expanded industry landscape offers advisors more sophisticated options than ever before.</p><p> For those who have built a robust international business, there are a number of firms who perceive this niche as ripe with opportunity and are proving to be the destination of choice for high quality international advisors and teams. Firms such as Snowden Lane Partners and Dynasty Financial Partners have assembled best-in-class platforms, resources and capabilities to service international business and offer advisors greater freedom, flexibility and control. As we&rsquo;ve seen of late, when one door seemingly closes, a new door opens that beckons with possibility.</p><p> Nothing frustrates an advisor more than having to be at the mercy of his firm.  While financial advisors often enjoy a high degree of autonomy (provided they are running a compliant business), that may not be enough given today&rsquo;s changing business climate. Firms and business models born of the changing climate have created new opportunities for advisors, allowing them to evolve and meet the needs of their clients (as well as their own business and life goals). And it&rsquo;s those advisors who recognize when it&rsquo;s time to take advantage of these new opportunities that will thrive.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 15:25:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 15:25:28.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_88Vu1e4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/has-your-firm-evolved-to-meet-the-changing-business-environment/\", \"post_id\": \"10960\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 15:25:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 15:25:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"has-your-firm-evolved-to-meet-the-changing-business-environment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10958\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5357\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Find-More-Effective-and-Less-Expensive-Legal-Advice.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"692\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463025600,"author_id":133,"chart_url":""}

We also don&rsquo;t suffer from time deprivation because of other people&rsquo;s incessant need for our attention.</p><h3> There are three primary reasons we&rsquo;re starved for time: We don&rsquo;t know when to prioritize, how to prioritize, or how to maintain our priorities.</h3><p> <br/> But, if you want an extra hour of time every day, I have some techniques that will provide immediate results.</p><p> Before you go all &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard this before,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m happy to grant many have written about such techniques. Steven Covey&rsquo;s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and David Allen&rsquo;s Getting Things Done are both brilliant pieces of work.</p><p> Oftentimes, however, reading a book and then attempting to apply fancy rules and processes becomes, well, tiring and ineffective. So, here&rsquo;s my version on one tiny page.</p><h3> Plan tomorrow at the end of today</h3><p> Nothing will make you sleep more peacefully than knowing your tomorrow is already planned, prioritized, and waiting for you when you arrive at work.</p><p> Do tomorrow&rsquo;s plan before you &ldquo;leave the office&rdquo; today. That way, you get to actually plan your next day as opposed to literally or figuratively being hijacked by whomever gets an email into your inbox first.</p><p> In know you&rsquo;ve heard this before, but are you actually doing it?</p><h3> Use these three questions as your guide</h3><p> Your best thoughts and strategies come in the wake of asking yourself great questions. I suggest asking yourself these three (again, before you leave the office). Let them be your guide as you plan your next day or week or month or year or decade.</p><p> &ldquo;What is important and urgent&mdash;to me?&rdquo;</p><p> No matter what, any item, project, or task that is a yes to both parts of this question should be scheduled and preferably done first. Always know what&rsquo;s important to you and never let that be at the mercy of something that&rsquo;s not.</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s important to me, but not urgent?&rdquo;</p><p> Ah, this is the longer-term important activity we tend to push and push and push. Don&rsquo;t!! You can push it a wee bit, but the trick here is to schedule it and then know when you&rsquo;ll actually do it.</p><p> Another alternative, one I use because of my vocation, is to allocate portions of each day to focus on mid- and long-term projects, relationship building, or whatever it might be for you.</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s important or urgent to someone else, but not to me?&rdquo;</p><p> I realize people scream loudly when it&rsquo;s important to them. Sometimes it&rsquo;s your boss or coworker or customer. In most cases, even with your boss, you can negotiate these to a third priority.</p><p> The issue that plagues most of us, however, is this class of activities or requests typically derail your entire life. Be careful not to let them.</p><p> What about those activities that are neither important nor urgent?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re wondering what to do with activities, don&rsquo;t. Just dump them so you can focus on the other three.</p><h3> Become a master at saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;</h3><p> You&rsquo;re far more likely to regret the things you say yes to than the things you say no to.</p><p> Your time is given away because you said yes, not because someone asked for it.

These two factors are very different and also different in the nature of how people are connecting.  </p><p> In the developed world, we have the viral connectivity of the smartphone; in the developing world, we have the basic connectivity of the mobile phone. Soon, both will transition into smart and mobile objects from cars and televisions to heating systems and refrigerators. In fact, with Nest and Samsung Home, it&rsquo;s already pretty much there.</p><p> The banking system meanwhile is still stuck in a world of debit and credit transactional structures of volume and value based upon people paying for things.  As we move from paying for things to consuming parts of things and as our devices order those things on our behalf, the banking system needs to rethink.</p><p> A great example is what we saw coming out the M-PESA success in Kenya. Many say this has not been successful in other countries, and yet one in three Africans with a mobile subscription are actively using mobile wallets today, more than any other continent. This is because Africans have realised that once they are on the network, they can do far more than just talk.They can transact, trade, text, transmit and telecommunicate. A world has opened to the billions of people who were formerly off the network and, as a result, they are reinventing the network. For Africans, airtime is a value store.</p><p> In fact, the M-PESA system created something interesting: financial inclusion.  When the system launched almost a decade ago, only 2.5 million Kenyans had bank accounts; now, 15 million Kenyans are banked.  This is because mobile transactions create mobile credit histories create bankability. More than this, when banks like Equity bank in Kenya saw the success of M-PESA, they woke up to the opportunity and eventually competed with them. From a service originally scorned as opening up fraud and theft opportunities, M-PESA has led to a rethinking of financial services.</p><p> Add to this the work of charitable trusts like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank, UNESCO and more, and we see other focus on mobile financial inclusion coming through. For example, how come there&rsquo;s so many malnourished children in Africa? Live Aid and other big fund raising events have scourged into our brains the idea that Africans are regularly experiencing drought and famine. Why?</p><p> Sure, because there&rsquo;s crop failure but how come they couldn&rsquo;t insure themselves against crop failure? Because the system was not set up to provide insurance to people who lived on a dollar a day. So let&rsquo;s imagine people living on the poverty line could bank half a cent a day as an insurance against crop failure. Just half a cent a day would be enough.  Would they insure themselves?</p><p> Well the bet is that most would. So now project forward. A crop failure in 2020 in large parts of Central Africa, where millions of people with mobile telephones have taken out micro insurances against crop failure by saving half a cent a day to cover themselves against famine. No more famine in Africa.</p><p> That&rsquo;s the dream, and dreams are becoming realities. </p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 16:11:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 16:11:45.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_InBmBgU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/reimagining-finance-for-the-internet-through-peer-to-peer-changes/\", \"post_id\": \"10964\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 16:11:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 16:11:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"reimagining-finance-for-the-internet-through-peer-to-peer-changes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10963\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5359\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Reimagining-Finance-for-the-Internet-Through-Peer-To-Peer-Changes.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"398\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462964400,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;m too busy. I just don&rsquo;t have enough time.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> As advisors we&rsquo;ve all heard this refrain, and we know that active business owners seldom have &ldquo;enough time.&rdquo; The only speed bumps high enough to slow their pace are death and terminal burnout.</p><p> Owners are not ill intentioned, instead they are so well intentioned that they take on additional business-related tasks the moment they complete one. With this pattern in place, owners will never have time to plan for their futures.</p><p> What they need is not more time, but an awareness that they must change their role in their businesses if they are ever to exit successfully. If they remain &ldquo;all things to all people,&rdquo; and if they insist on reviewing and directing every decision, they will not develop management teams that can operate without them&mdash;an essential requirement of increasing transferable value.</p><p> Indeed, in the words of Peter Drucker, &ldquo;As a new venture develops and grows, the roles and relationships of the original entrepreneurs inexorably change. If the founders refuse to accept this, they will stunt the business and may even destroy it. But even among the founders who can accept that they themselves need to do something, few know how to tackle changing their own roles and relationships.1\"</p><h3> In claiming that they are too busy to engage in Exit Planning, owners don&rsquo;t realize that: <br/>  </h3><li> They are failing to plan for the future of their businesses and personal lives, and</li><li> What we&rsquo;re ultimately asking them to do is change what they are doing in their businesses. <br/>  </li><p> Owners who become &ldquo;fewer things to fewer people,&rdquo; have more time to think, plan and act for their future benefit, and the time they do spend in their companies is more beneficial to their companies and gratifying personally. Without that change owners will always be too busy.         </p><p> The consequences to owners who are their business are drastic: one day they discover that their businesses have little value without them. As a result, these businesses can&rsquo;t be sold or transferred and business growth is limited to the capacity and endurance of the owner. In mathematical terms: If Owner = Business, Business &cong; $0.</p><h3> As Exit Planners, we must demonstrate to too-busy-to-plan owners that: <br/>  </h3><li> They must &ldquo;accept that they themselves need to do something.&rdquo;</li><li> They need to work with experienced advisors who &ldquo;know how to tackle changing the owner&rsquo;s roles and relationships.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> How do you accomplish the first task? <br/>  </h3><li> Discuss the fact that entrepreneurial companies reach a point&mdash;an inflection point&mdash;where they will either stagnate or grow rapidly. That inflection point is the owner&rsquo;s decision to change their relationship to the business in order to free up its growth potential or to continue on the treadmill. The fact that the owner is &ldquo;too busy&rdquo; to plan is a strong indicator that he is doing too much and stifling the growth of the enterprise.</li><li> Provide examples of what changing an owner&rsquo;s role means, how it is done, and what the likely consequences are. Hint: almost every mature, yet growing company, you represent has owners who have changed roles substantially as the business grew.</li><li> Provide information on what companies and owners do to create transferable value&mdash;that is, a company whose value and cash flow is not disrupted if the owner leaves&mdash;via sale or death. <br/>  </li><p> In short, when owners proclaim they are too busy to plan, be in a position to respond, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!

Consulting, delivering services to clients, even writing books and delivering speeches. </p><p> A business on the other hand, is about much more than your presence. You can use all of the tools of a practice, but add even more options that leverage your time: digital training programs, assessment tools and live or virtual services delivered by someone OTHER THAN you.</p><p> A business isn&rsquo;t always the right choice, but it does have one distinct advantage to you, the owner: it gives you options. The option to sell, to hire someone to run it for you (permanently or temporarily) or to take a break when you need one.</p><p> Those options rarely exist in a practice. Unless you have a killer evergreen book that can fund some time off, it&rsquo;s hard to take a meaningful break in a practice without seeing a correspondingly meaningful drop in revenue.</p><p> Now not everyone wants&mdash;or is cut out&mdash;to run a true business (maybe you&rsquo;re running a lifestyle practice that suits you beautifully). But if you&rsquo;re ready to break away from the trading time for money model, you can absolutely make a few moves now to start creating that reality.</p><h3> Move #1: <br/>  </h3><p> Determine your optimal business strategy&mdash;and work it. This is about consciously choosing to morph your practice into a business. Let&rsquo;s say your long-term plan is to grow by developing products. What do you need to do to make that work? Is your current base of right-fit clients and prospects large enough to recoup your investment and build for the future? Have you tested your product ideas with some real live potential buyers? What&rsquo;s the best platform to deliver your products? Will you need/do you have the right alliance partners? The answers all have implications for how to best structure your time and spend your resources, not to mention build your exit plan (tip: always envision an exit plan).</p><h3> Move #2: <br/>  </h3><p> Invest a percentage of your time in building the business. A brilliant strategy poorly executed is worthless. One client&mdash;with a thriving business&mdash;was chuckling at a recent industry conference when his peers asked him if he wrote all his own books (he does). While they were scratching their heads trying to figure out how he got it all done, he was busy creating his empire.</p><p> His &ldquo;secret&rdquo;? Consistently, strategically investing about 10% of his time in growing his business and outsourcing everything he couldn&rsquo;t or didn&rsquo;t want to do. He spends that 10% investment time hiring and teaching new staff and developing saleable content for non-clients he&rsquo;d never be able to serve directly.</p><h3> Move #3: <br/>  </h3><p> If you backslide, find yourself some help. This could be as simple as getting yourself an ace assistant&mdash;virtual or otherwise&mdash;who can keep the administrative pieces of your life humming along. Or it could mean building yourself a small village: business coach, marketing/branding maven, PR expert, ghostwriter, editor, training developer, etc.</p><p> The bottom line is that you want to make the decision to build a practice or a business consciously.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve built both and they each have distinct advantages. But when you&rsquo;re ready to move on, there&rsquo;s nothing like having cash in your pocket to fund your next adventure.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 16:22:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 16:22:01.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_tkQV5x7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/running-a-practice-vs-business-moves-to-create-your-own-reality/\", \"post_id\": \"10967\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 16:22:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 16:22:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"running-a-practice-vs-business-moves-to-create-your-own-reality\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10966\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5361\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Running-a-Practice-vs-Business-Moves-to-Create-Your-Own-Reality.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1213\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462975200,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5152,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Shocking News, Forecasting Is Not an Exact Science!","link":"shocking-news-forecasting-is-not-an-exact-science","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In his May 2016 post &ldquo; <a href=\"/advisor/even-robust-on-line-retirement-tools-are-fraught-with-irregularities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Even Robust On-Line Retirement Tools Are Fraught With &lsquo;Irregularities&rsquo; </a> ,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ARQWealth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Jason Lilly </a>  of <a href=\"http://arqwealth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ARQ Wealth Advisors, LLC </a> .  points to a Texas Tech University study of 36 online retirement calculators, including major firms like Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group, AARP, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Group (FINRA), when he states: The research team, which included well-known industry veteran Harold Evensky, found only 11 of the 36 worthy of a passing grade. The team cited overly simplistic tools as one of the main reasons for its harsh assessment.</p><h3> From the conclusions Mr. Lilly draws from those portions of the study that he reveals, you would think that there was no value to the robo-advisor calculators.  Not so.</h3>What does Mr. Lilly find as faults in the website calculators?  They are overly simplistic and not sufficiently accurate.  He then compares their output on retirement to driving:Similar to driving direction websites like MapQuest, retirement calculators can show you how to get from one place to another, but can&rsquo;t adjust for unpredictability MapQuest is not the correct metaphor, because driving directions are used immediately, not decades from now.  Furthermore, good apps do warn of traffic.Mr. Lilly is really discussing long-range predictions.  Thus, weather forecasting would be a more apt comparison.  If so, then his critique of the robo-advisor calculators amounts to saying that a weather forecast had no value because it failed to warn of an earthquake two or three decades before it occurredWhen forecasting retirement, the pitfalls Mr. Lilly attributes to the online calculators actually apply to nearly all calculators, including those used by professional planners, which he tacitly approves.Any forecasting method requires setting assumptions.  The more computing power, and imagination, you have, the more assumptions the forecasting can address.  For example, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College designed a retirement calculator for their website, Squared Away, that is more comprehensive than most.  As Steven Saas, one of the professors from the Center, describes their retirement calculator, the forecasting for retirement assumes that an individual&rsquo;s earning power follows a curve, dropping off in her late 40&rsquo;s, rather than being linear as most calculators assume.  The use of a curve is based on studies of earnings they conducted.  Also, the website draws on spending information from the user&rsquo;s geographic area so that use of funds in retirement will be more accurate.  Thus, the predictions of this site are more comprehensive than many other calculators.When he faults the robo-advisor calculators, Mr. Lilly never addresses these issues, earning capacity following a curve and spending differing by geographic location.  Instead, he bases his claim that robo-planning calculators are faulty on the fact that they do not account for the rate at which healthcare costs are rising.You can easily counter this claim by saying that spending for most people in retirement follows a curve, dropping off in later years.  Thus, the linear spending assumed by a calculator creates an ample cushion for health care costs.A more powerful and interesting counter is this:  What if, like Colorado that may adopt statewide healthcare, the US goes for government funded healthcare?  Then Mr. Lilly&rsquo;s concern is completely alleviated.  This is why any forecasting is bound to err &ndash; no one can predict the future.And yet, for those without the knowledge of the future that Merlin the Wizard in T.H. White&rsquo;s Once and Future King, or without tremendous resources for computations and research, these calculators &ldquo;fraught with irregularities&rdquo; are still quite useful.  Why?  As any sophisticated planner knows, be she human or robot, we only use calculators to educate and to inspire clients to act, never counting on the future to resemble their forecasts.__________P.S. - as we said many months ago in &ldquo;The results from retirement calculations on different websites vary.  Why?&rdquo;:In the end, using any of these calculators gives you a sense of where you stand vis a vis your retirement goal.  If you are far off, it gives you impetus to act so you get on track; and if you are on track, then you it gives you a sense of security.For me, the most important result from using any calculator should be assessing and sticking to a good strategy for saving and investing with a long-term perspective.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 16:37:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 16:37:15.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_UJhR6aJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/shocking-news-forecasting-is-not-an-exact-science/\", \"post_id\": \"10969\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 16:37:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 16:37:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"shocking-news-forecasting-is-not-an-exact-science\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10968\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5362\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shocking-News-Forecasting-Is-Not-an-Exact-Science.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"862\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462957200,"author_id":455,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5153,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Mutual Funds 101: Investing in Stocks, Bonds and Money Market","link":"mutual-funds-101-investing-in-stocks-bonds-and-money-market","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Mutual funds carry a unique set of risks and benefits in just the same way as other investments, despite marketing that may have led you to believe otherwise.</p><p> A mutual fund is an investment in securities, including bonds, stocks and other vehicles, that is funded by a pooling of money from various investors. Before you decide to invest in a mutual fund, you need to know what you`re getting and what all your options are.</p><h3> Stock, Bond and Money Market</h3><p> Mutual funds usually come in three distinct types. Each type has inherent drawbacks and benefits, so weigh your financial goals and risk tolerance before making a final decision.</p><p> The stock mutual fund has the potential to pull a high return but poses more risk than the other available types. With stock funds, you must consider the purpose behind the stock selection. For example, some firms bundle together stocks in a particular industry, such as medical. Others use more general selection criteria to meet a goal, such as rapid growth.</p><p> Since stocks are known to fluctuate and are fully exposed to the volatility of the market, you can lose a significant portion of your investment if the fund stocks tank or the market itself dives. Get familiar with the fund manager`s aim behind the stock selection and evaluate current stock rates and histories for those securities included in the funds.</p><p> A bond fund is often less risky than a stock fund but carries more risk and a higher gain potential than a money market vehicle. Bond funds vary dramatically in type, from 'junk bonds` issued by weakened or new companies to municipal bonds from local governments.</p><p> Junk bonds naturally carry a lot of risk but have a higher gain potential. A new company may take off unexpectedly, earning you a big return on your investment. On the other hand, if the business fails, your fund`s value will drop. Municipal bonds from a stable city will cost more but carry less risk than a bond from a city that is struggling. Since the risks and benefits vary greatly by bond type, you`ll need to consider all the angles before investing in a bond fund.</p><p> A money market mutual fund, not to be confused with a money market bank account, is normally the mutual fund type that carries the lowest risk and gain potentials. Federal regulations restrict money market funds to safe bets, such as short-term investments in high quality vehicles. While you won`t have the opportunity to gain as much as you could under a stock or bond fund, money market funds may be a good option for you if you`re testing the waters or have a low loss tolerance.</p><h3> Know the Fees</h3><p> Your mutual fund choice is subject to fees charged by the managing entity. Know what all the fees are associated with the funds you`re considering so you can compare rates across different providers.</p><p> You may have to pay a percentage fee upfront or when you sell. Some funds charge a management fee instead of an upfront or back end percentage. Other costs are deducted from the total investment pool itself, as found under the managing entity`s fee table in the prospectus. While you won`t pay an individual bill for those other costs, excessive fee taking from the entire pool can hurt the fund's performance.</p><p> Selecting a managing entity can be almost as difficult as deciding the fund type. Price alone shouldn`t be the deciding factor, as you need a fund that is managed well to protect your investment and earn a return. Look at feedback from Finance Community about the fund managers you`re considering and review past performance before making a decision.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 17:07:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 17:07:50.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_2gUIiDJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/mutual-funds-101-investing-in-stocks-bonds-and-money-market/\", \"post_id\": \"10971\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 17:07:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 17:07:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"mutual-funds-101-investing-in-stocks-bonds-and-money-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10970\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5363\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mutual-Funds-101-Investing-in-Stocks-Bonds-and-Money-Market.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1044\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462982400,"author_id":282,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5154,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Can't Ignore Content Marketing to Improve Brand Awareness","link":"why-you-cant-ignore-content-marketing-to-improve-brand-awareness","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Google only loves you when everyone else loves you first,&rdquo; quipped entrepreneur Wendy Piersall in 2007. Want to increase the reputation of your brand online?</p><p> Content marketing is something you can&rsquo;t ignore if you do marketing or advertising on the internet. If you want to attract customers and generate sales, content is crucial.  From brilliant blog posts to video and more, you&rsquo;ll need it to attract and close new business.</p><p> Here are a few reasons why content marketing is essential if you want your prospects to talk about your brand. </p><h3> <strong>  1. Content Marketing Builds Brand Awareness </strong></h3><p> <br/> Brand awareness is the extent to which consumers are familiar with your company. It can cement your position in a competitive marketplace or in a specific niche.</p><p> Exposing your brand through content marketing is a great way to build brand mindshare. Mindshare is the amount of buzz your product or service generates. The more mindshare your business has with your prospects, the more business you&rsquo;ll attract.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p><p> Create content that addresses the needs of your ideal customer on a regular basis. Depending on your niche, you might write blog posts summarizing events in your industry. You might write product tutorials or how-to guides. You might tell a story of serving a customer via case studies.  You might write product reviews or film demo videos.  You might share slides from a talk or write a whitepaper.</p><p> Encourage your readers to comment and share your content. If you want this to happen organically, you&rsquo;ll have to make it useful to them.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget about how people will consume your content on a mobile device. eMarketer reports that there will be over 2 billion smartphone users in 2016. Smartphones are the second most popular device used to search the web. Produce content that&rsquo;s easy to view on mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. Make sure your website is mobile-friendly too so people will have a positive experience.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Content Marketing Can Make Your Company an Industry Thought Leader </strong></h3><p> <br/> Thought leaders are experts in their respective niches. Publishing and sharing content over time will make you a go-to authority figure.</p><p> After I had been blogging for a few years, other companies began linking to our website. Journalists called for interviews on internet marketing topics. I appeared as a guest on podcasts. I spoke at conferences and meetings.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not to brag. But it does prove the power of sharing your thoughts and stories.</p><p> So how can your company influence more purchasing decisions?</p><p> Put yourself out there. Create authoritative content that educates, informs and entertains. You may be an experienced practitioner in your industry, but are unknown. Offering up your experience can establish yourself as a specialist in your industry.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let perfect become the enemy of good.  Your blogs and videos don&rsquo;t need to be perfect. You just need to write them and film them, then share them. We write over 100 blogs per month for clients, and several good ones don&rsquo;t get published because of overthinking.</p><p> Know your ideal prospect. Thought leadership requires a thorough understanding of your customer. Improve your credibility by citing reputable sources, checking facts and improving your social clout. Enlighten followers with expert industry-specific tips and must-read perspectives. Most importantly, write on their level, not your peers&rsquo;.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Content Marketing Builds Trust </strong></h3><p> <br/> Creating relevant content can increase trust between your company and its customers. Having difficulty engaging with companies you want to sell to? A well-planned content marketing strategy can attract those prospects and make you a contender.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t just talk about your products. Instead, compare your technologies with others. Write on the state of you ideal customers&rsquo; industry. Share tips that they will find useful.</p><p> Address the competition. Let&rsquo;s face it. There are times when your competitor&rsquo;s product is better than yours. Let people know the hows and whys. Both prospects and Google will reward you for it.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to talk about price/cost. My friend Marcus Sheridan (The Sales Lion) wrote a great piece on why you should talk about price. Read it. Your honesty will build trust, even if you aren&rsquo;t the least expensive option.</p><p> Providing in-depth information positions your company as a transparent resource. It will increase your online reputation and you&rsquo;ll see sales as a result.</p><p> Generating top-quality content increases engagement and boosts the visibility of your brand online. If you want to increase brand awareness or become a sought-after thought leader in your niche, content marketing might be the way to go.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 17:17:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 17:17:06.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_kyuELQP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-cant-ignore-content-marketing-to-improve-brand-awareness/\", \"post_id\": \"10973\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 17:17:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 17:17:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-cant-ignore-content-marketing-to-improve-brand-awareness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10972\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5364\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-You-Cant-Ignore-Content-Marketing-to-Improve-Brand-Awareness.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"829\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462971600,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5155,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Little Town That Could: Leamington, Canada","link":"the-little-town-that-could-leamington-canada","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Leamington, a little town in the province of Ontario is the tomato capital of Canada. The town earned the honor by farming vast acreages of tomatoes in fields and greenhouses. Their tomato expertise caught the attention of the  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz\" target=\"_blank\">  H. J. Heinz </a>  Company who erected a factory in Leamington in 1908. And for more than 100 years, the factory pumped out Heinz Ketchup and a variety of baby foods to markets in Canada and the USA.</p><p> That tenure came to an end in 2014 when Heinz decided to  <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/business/2013/11/14/heinz_to_close_leamington_plant_740_employees_affected.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mothball the factory </a>  and put 740 people out of work. Heinz, like so many other multinationals gave the stereotypical corporate rationale &mdash; they said the plant was unprofitable and part of a global restructuring.  <strong>  You can imagine the emotional and economic impact on a community of only 28,000. </strong></p><h3> Declining Sensitivity of Downsizing</h3><p> <br/> Plant closings and corresponding job losses have become so prevalent that the public rarely bats an eye at the calamity. Displaced employees and their unions do little more than shrug their shoulders in submission.  Late last year, Kraft Heinz announced it was closing 7 North American plants, and severing the heads of 2,600 people. This story was news for a day. That&rsquo;s right, one day.</p><p> But, one little town was not about to give in to the seemingly inevitable. Taking a lesson from the signature phrase in the illustrated children&rsquo;s book,  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Engine_That_Could\" target=\"_blank\">  The Little Engine That Could </a> , the Leamington community did not throw in the towel.</p><p> Like the struggling little train edging toward a daunting hill, plant workers, farmers, politicians and investors said, &ldquo;We think we can. We think we can. We think we can. We know we can.&rdquo;</p><p> After months of collective hard work by several stakeholders, a consortium of local investors, the government, the union and the farmers worked out a deal to keep the plant operating by securing a contract to co-pack several products for Heinz. This would save the jobs of 30% of the original workforce. Beyond that, the deal offered  <a href=\"http://windsorstar.com/news/highbury-canco-corporation-to-acquire-heinz-facility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Highbury Canco </a> , the new owners of the plant, the opportunity to expand their co-pack business that did not include tomato ketchup.</p><h3> Then Along Came French&rsquo;s</h3><p> <br/> Today, tomatoes grown in Leamington are once again being used for Ketchup. This is a result of a tomato paste supply arrangement between Highbury Canco and French&rsquo;s, a company known for mustard but keen to make inroads in the ketchup business. With plant employment surpassing 400, and with French&rsquo;s Ketchup finding its way to Canadian grocery shelves, &lsquo;the little town that could&rsquo; appeared to be accelerating down the other side of that daunting hill.</p><p> But, all of a sudden, there was a detour on the track to recovery.  <a href=\"http://www.loblaw.ca/en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Loblaws </a> , Canada&rsquo;s largest food retailer, announced that they were discontinuing French&rsquo;s ketchup, claiming that the new brand&rsquo;s sales weren&rsquo;t cutting it. The truth of the matter was that French&rsquo;s, though not outselling Heinz, was cannibalizing the sales of Loblaws&rsquo; private label, President&rsquo;s Choice. Nonetheless, when a retailer with the size and clout of Loblaws makes a call like this, it is game-over for the supplier.</p><h3> Little Guys Can Still Be Kings</h3><p> <br/> However, an outraged customer of the French&rsquo;s brand who knew the Leamington saga went to Facebook and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153763573110860&amp;set=pb.632680859.-2207520000.1456417123.&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  posted </a> his distaste for Loblaw&rsquo;s decision. <strong>  The post was shared by 133,000 other little guys who also saw red. </strong></p><p> The media latched onto the story. An Ontario member of parliament presented a petition calling for French&rsquo;s ketchup to be served in the dining room of the legislature, replacing the current Heinz brand. The pressure mounted and  <a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/business/ketchup+kerfuffle+loblaw+restock+stores+with+frenchs+ketchup/11786388/story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the grocery chain folded </a> . French&rsquo;s is back on Loblaws&rsquo; shelves.</p><p> The Leamington story, and the intestinal fortitude of this little town epitomizes the ethic of everyday people who believe in themselves, and in the strength of others like them to make what seems impossible, possible. When these factors come together behind a powerful purpose, little guys, whether they be mom &amp; pop merchants, farmers, manufacturers, or consumers can still be kings. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 17:19:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 17:19:37.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Gw4ueEF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-little-town-that-could-leamington-canada/\", \"post_id\": \"10975\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 17:19:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 17:19:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-little-town-that-could-leamington-canada\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10974\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5365\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Little-Town-That-Could-Leamington-Canada.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1107\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462993200,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}

Keep in mind that this is not a one-size-fits-all formula; you will still have to do some of your own research, and analyze your own profiles to see what is working for you, and what is not.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Post-Pin-Tweet-1.png\" width=\"604\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Post-Pin-Tweet-Best-Time-Outreach-2.jpg\" width=\"936\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Post-Pin-Tweet-Best-Time-Outreach-3.jpg\" width=\"773\"/></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-10 17:19:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-10 17:19:54.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Kr3WDzH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/infographic-the-best-time-to-outreach-on-facebook-twitter-and-linkedin/\", \"post_id\": \"10980\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-10 17:19:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-10 17:19:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"infographic-the-best-time-to-outreach-on-facebook-twitter-and-linkedin\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10976\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5366\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Infographic-The-Best-Time-to-Outreach-on-Facebook-Twitter-and-LinkedIn.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1554\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1462993200,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5158,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"These Strategies Will Help You Become Powerfully Relevant to Your Prospects, Clients","link":"these-strategies-will-help-you-become-powerfully-relevant-to-your-prospects-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Connect. Become relevant. Resonate. Make an impact. Those are the steps you follow to build your most powerful relationships. </h3><p> <br/> In Part One of this three-part series on the Laws of Power Relationships, I described strategies for connecting. In this post, I share four Relationship Laws that will help you become more relevant to time-starved prospects and clients and get invited back for meeting after meeting.</p><p> All of these laws are presented in my new book, Power Relationships: 26 Irrefutable Laws for Building Extraordinary Relationships. To help you apply these laws to your own relationships, I have created a 90-page  <a href=\"http://andrewsobel.createsend1.com/t/r-l-pjhuhyk-ijdrudzi-ju/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Power Relationships Planning Guide </a>  that you can download for free if you buy a copy of the book.</p><h3> <strong>  The power of truly understanding the person on the other side of the desk  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Bob Dylan wrote a tuneful but doleful lament about a past lover called Positively Fourth St. At the end he sings, &ldquo;I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t we all want this from others? It&rsquo;s that deep understanding of who we are, what we&rsquo;ve been through, and all the pressures and constraints we&rsquo;re under.</p><p> The feeling of not being truly understood is widespread, and no less so among your prospects and clients. That&rsquo;s why Relationship Law Nine is so important: Walk in the other person&rsquo;s shoes.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the problem: It&rsquo;s very easy to get wrapped up in yourself and to be blind to what others have been through and how they&rsquo;re feeling. When we can only walk in our own shoes, we risk being full of ourselves. We repel others rather than attract them.</p><p> To walk in your client&rsquo;s shoes, think about the pressures they under. Imagine what they&rsquo;re feeling right now. Empathize with them. Become the person. What circumstances could be impacting how they&rsquo;re feeling? Did they just get chewed out by their boss? Are they feeling stuck in their career? Are they having difficulties with a teenage child?</p><p> Remember, when you meet with a prospect, you are asking, &ldquo;Can I build trust and rapport and identify a need that my solutions address?&rdquo; But the executive across the table is wondering things like &ldquo;I hear so many claims&ndash;can this company really do what they say they can do?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How am I going to get my boss and other business leaders on board with this idea?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Am I going to look weak in my organization if I do business with them?&rdquo;</p><p> President Abraham Lincoln, who was famous for his unusually skilled grasp of human nature and his deep empathy, once wrote: &ldquo;When I go to see a man, I spend one third of my time thinking about what I am going to say, and two-thirds of my time thinking about what he will say.&rdquo;</p><p> When you are able to walk in the other person&rsquo;s shoes, the empathy and understanding that naturally arises will make you seem engaging, trustworthy, and interested in their success.</p><h3> <strong>  Do you have loyalists or fair-weather acquaintances? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Driven by the power of social media and the desire to have a large &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; of followers, we have become obsessed with building ever-large networks of contacts. People boast of having thousands or even millions of &ldquo;friends&rdquo; through various platforms. A strong network is very important and it confers many benefits. But when push comes to shove and you really need help, you&rsquo;re going to draw on a relatively small circle of relationships with people who know you, like you, trust you, and will go out of their way to help you.</p><p> Most great, historical movements began with a small core. Jesus needed only 12 disciples&mdash;not thousands of fair-weather friends&mdash;and these were enough to spread his word and eventually create over two billion adherents. The anti-slavery movements in the 19th century and the civil rights movement in the 20th century were all initially propelled by a small, inner circle of loyalists. These &ldquo;critical few&rdquo; individuals were loyal to a cause but also, and invariably, to a person, to a leader&mdash;a leader who was also utterly and totally loyal to them.</p><p> Ask yourself: Who will go out of their way to endorse you and introduce you to their network? Who will drop what they are doing and help you when you are in need? Who will tell others that they&rsquo;ve never known someone as trustworthy and talented as you? For these things, you need a handful of great relationships&mdash;between ten and twenty.</p><p> Do you know a small group of people who will walk through a wall for you? Perhaps more importantly, are you willing to put yourself on the line for them? Have you given them your unwavering loyalty? Have you invested in making them successful?</p><p> Make sure you have loyalists, not just acquaintances. Follow Relationship Law Twenty-Three, which will push you to become deeply relevant to a handful of important individuals in your career and life: To succeed, you need a small group of people who trust you, believe in you, and are committed to you&mdash;not hundreds of superficial contacts.</p><h3> <strong>  The ultimate in relevance: Become part of your client&rsquo;s growth and profits </strong></h3><p> <br/> Think about this: If your plumber calls you up and suggests you have lunch to discuss the latest joint-soldering techniques, you probably would decline. And, as much as you like him, if another reputable plumber offered to do a major job for significantly less, you might very well be swayed to accept.</p><p> But what if your doctor called? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got your test results back, and you ought to come by so we can discuss them. I have some important suggestions for you about your diet and lifestyle.&rdquo; I think your response would be, &ldquo;How soon can you see me?&rdquo;</p><p> Relationship Law Twenty-Two frames this contrast for client-facing professionals: Become part of your clients&rsquo; growth and profits and they&rsquo;ll never get enough of you. The flip side of this Law is that if clients view you as an expense to be managed, they&rsquo;ll cut you at any time.</p><p> When there&rsquo;s a downturn, or when clients are under financial pressures, they focus on cutting discretionary expenses. But they won&rsquo;t cut an investment that&rsquo;s proven to help grow revenues or increase profits. And you should be such an investment.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re working with clients, you have to clearly show how your work is supporting their growth and profits. A client can replace a commodity &ldquo;expert for hire&rdquo; at any time&mdash;perhaps with a cheaper expert. But a provider who is seen as supporting a client&rsquo;s most essential programs is not easily replaceable. Their cost is framed against a much larger set of benefits.</p><p> This Law doesn&rsquo;t just apply to client relationships. For example, if your boss views you as directly helping her achieve her most important priorities for the year, then you&rsquo;ll be considered indispensible.</p><p> To be seen as part of growth and profits, you have to show how your products and services are helping your client achieve his or her highest-level goals. A good starting point is a very simple question: How are you going to be evaluated at the end of the year? Then, you can ask a second, related question: How do your individual goals support the organization&rsquo;s overall strategy and key priorities for this year?</p><h3> Treat your best prospects as if they were already clients</h3><p> <br/> The fourth law to help you become more relevant to your prospects is number Fifteen: Treat a prospect like a client, and there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll become one.</p><p> Think about it&ndash;here are the kinds of things you probably do for clients:</p><li> Meet on a regular basis to deepen rapport and trust</li><li> Bring them value-added ideas about how to improve their business.</li><li> Show them how other clients of yours are overcoming challenges similar to what they face.</li><li> Make introductions to other relevant people in your network.</li><li> Invite them to events that your firm puts on.</li><li> Organize a visit to see another client who has faced a similar challenge and used a similar solution.</li><li> Invite them to speak at a conference or symposium.</li><li> &hellip;and so on <br/>  </li><p> One of my clients wanted to do business with a major prospect which could be valuable, marquis client. They were told, point-blank, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to do business with you. We are already well-served.&rdquo; For one year they did all the things in the list, above. Finally, they got a call&ndash;with a major contract for their services. The executive told them, &ldquo;For over one year you&rsquo;ve treated us as if we were already your client. You&rsquo;ve given us better service than our existing suppliers. You&rsquo;ve earned this.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 15:28:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 15:28:46.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_6cRlZcI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/these-strategies-will-help-you-become-powerfully-relevant-to-your-prospects-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"10985\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 15:28:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 15:28:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"these-strategies-will-help-you-become-powerfully-relevant-to-your-prospects-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10984\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5371\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/These-Strategies-Will-Help-You-Become-Powerfully-Relevant-to-Your-Prospects-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"624\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463079660,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5159,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Reach Your Goals: Why You Should Educate Your Advisor on Your Strategy and Expectations","link":"reach-your-goals-why-you-should-educate-your-advisor-on-your-strategy-and-expectations","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Tripp Rockwell</p><p> Your Advisor&rsquo;s not telling you that your long-term financial goals may be out of sync with the level of risk you&rsquo;re willing to take in order to reach them. No risk, no reward, right? It&rsquo;s time to advise your advisor on how to advise you on financial advice.</p><p> According to a recent survey by asset manager Natixis, while about 73% of investors polled said that pursuing returns is more important, nearly 84% also said they would choose safety over risk.</p><p> So how can you balance increasing assets vs. tolerating risk? And how do you relate this to your advisor? For financial advisors, this balance presents a challenge as well. How your advisor is able to accurately assess this is by delving into your core natural risk propensity and tolerance, part of your financial personality.</p><p> The opportunity is to educate your advisor on realistic expectations and strategies to best reach your goals. And while he or she has the tools and training available to them in order to help you along, not everyone is onboard with matching your individual personality behaviors with your personal financial goals.</p><p> Where advisors often fall short is not identifying all of the risks associated with your particular situation: investment, financial, and personality risks. This is an important factor because under stress, you might not be as clearheaded or know all the ins and outs of a given situation in order to rationally process what&rsquo;s happening and make behaviorally smart decisions. You very well may be operating based on your core natural behavior.</p><p> As you&rsquo;re transitioning jobs, getting married, buying a house or preparing for retirement, you&rsquo;re under a lot of financial stress &ndash; worries regarding accumulating wealth may push you into new, riskier investment decisions. Then add market volatility, unforeseen personal events or escalating college tuitions or long-term health care costs, or the emotions associated with being in the &ldquo;withdrawal stage&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;accumulation phase&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;re pushed according to your core natural behavior. In many cases, this mix of stress and decisions based on your reaction to that stress is not beneficial for the long-term success of financial goals.</p><p> Your financial advisor needs to be in a position to manage not only your portfolio, but protect you from your natural self. This is an important step in the investor/advisor relationship and necessary to your financial success, because under stress, your risk behavior is less predictable without an objective tool. You may want to jump at every opportunity, or over-spend, or take no action at all. This is where knowing your behavioral insights and communication style, help your advisor help you and your significant other.</p><p> In many cases, a couples&rsquo; behavior will be directly opposite one another. So there is an added challenge for your advisor to know the behavior of each of you in order to address both in different ways.</p><p> So, how do you uncover these behavioral risks?</p><p> You need an objective, third party system so that your behavior, under stress, becomes more predictable and therefore can plan accordingly. Then, in combination with your experience and wisdom, discovering your financial natural behavior will allow you to become a behaviorally smart investor and provide valuable insights to your financial profile. It&rsquo;s an enlightening process to see if your advisor is right for you, and then in turn, to see if you&rsquo;re a match to them. And who knows? With these insights, you may find out a lot more about yourself and your partner, than you&rsquo;d previously known.</p><p> Be sure to discover all of your risks originating from your natural core behavior.

{"original_id":5160,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How My Special Needs Daughter Has Made Me a Better Entrepreneur","link":"how-my-special-needs-daughter-has-made-me-a-better-entrepreneur","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My wife and I launched PFI Advisors on September 25th, 2015.  One month and one day later, our 6-month old daughter, Layla, had her first seizure.  She was admitted into the hospital the next day, October 27th, and stayed there for 6 weeks.  It turns out that her brain never fully developed, which has led to seizures, spasms, feeding and digestion issues, vision issues, hearing issues, muscle-development issues, and of course, brain development issues.</p><p> By December, as we continued to uncover more problems with our baby, I sat my wife down and said, &ldquo;Maybe this isn&rsquo;t the best time to start a business and go several months without a paycheck (thank god we had already secured health insurance!).  If you need me to go find a &lsquo;real job,&rsquo; I can do that.&rdquo;  My wife, who is the true entrepreneur in the family, looked me right in the eye and said, &ldquo;We have three kids now.  Luke (2 &frac12; years old), Layla (8 months) and PFI Advisors (2 &frac12; months).  We will not allow Layla&rsquo;s condition to adversely affect either Luke&rsquo;s or PFI&rsquo;s growth and development.  Get back to the office and grow that company!&rdquo;</p><p> The next few months were filled with the typical activities of any newly-launched firm: building presentation decks, meeting with potential clients, asking centers of influence for introductions, and finding PR opportunities wherever possible.  As any entrepreneur will describe the early days of their company, it was an exhilarating time filled with much uncertainty.  Unfortunately, my wife and I had the added uncertainty of not knowing the future outcome of our daughter&rsquo;s quality of life.  I became an expert at multi-tasking: articles were written after midnight, with the glow of Layla&rsquo;s hospital monitors illuminating my keyboard; press interviews were conducted by phone in the hospital cafeteria; our third client engagement was finalized on the side of the road, stalling long enough before entering the &ldquo;dead zone&rdquo; underground in the hospital parking garage. </p><p> At first I thought I was at a huge disadvantage trying to juggle so much.  However, as we continued to grow the business, and I kept studying more and more startup businesses, I began to realize that every entrepreneur feels overwhelmed in the early stages and fights with the exact same issues I was having: how to get more hours out of the day; how to push through your self-doubts and fears; how to successfully wear multiple hats every day and still get everything accomplished.  I slowly came to appreciate the fact that my added burden was actually helping me with these common entrepreneurial hurdles.</p><h3> <strong>  Productivity </strong></h3><p> <br/> When we finally got Layla home in early December, she unfortunately didn&rsquo;t stay there for long.  Over the next several months, she spent more than 80 nights in the hospital, with most stays lasting over a week.  When I was in the office, I became a &ldquo;productivity ninja&rdquo; &ndash; whenever a task came across my desk, I would complete it immediately.  I never knew when the next phone call was coming to say, &ldquo;Layla just pulled her feeding tube out of her nose &ndash; heading to the ER!&rdquo; or &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t stop vomiting &ndash; heading to the ER!&rdquo; and I would be pulled away.  Not only was I afraid to &ldquo;put off until tomorrow what can be done today,&rdquo; but I didn&rsquo;t even have the luxury of putting things off until that afternoon!  Every entrepreneur needs to build the habit of completing their To Do tasks every day, and Layla was helping me develop that productivity &ldquo;muscle.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Travel </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you are traveling with an expense account, business trips can be a lot of fun.  Swanky hotels, room service at the end of the day, taking an afternoon off to see the local tourist sites, etc.  When you own the company, you realize very quickly how expensive business trips can be.  If you are paying airfare, hotel, rental car, etc., out of your own pocket -- a pocket without a steady paycheck --- you need to make every second of that business trip count.  You can&rsquo;t travel to see just one potential client &ndash; you need every minute of your day booked with productive meetings that can increase the value of your budding company.  With a sick daughter at home, I was more than just financially motivated to make every second away from home productive &ndash; I had to justify to myself and my family that my time away was more valuable than being home to administer medications, perform physical therapy, weigh and measure her special formula, and of course, be nearby in case of another dash to the hospital.  If I wasn&rsquo;t visiting a paying a client, I wouldn&rsquo;t allow myself to book a trip unless I could confirm a minimum of 5 meetings per day.</p><h3> <strong>  Motivation </strong></h3><p> <br/> Successful entrepreneurs find a way to remain determined and motivated in the face of setbacks and rejection.  They don&rsquo;t allow the limiting emotions of uncertainty and doubt hold them back.  Successful entrepreneurs find a way to remain focused and push through those fears.  While parts of Layla&rsquo;s condition could be distracting, having an ill daughter also provided me with laser-like focus on the business.  We didn&rsquo;t have the standard 3 years to become profitable that is often quoted in the press about startups.  Even with a great insurance policy, one of Layla&rsquo;s many seizure medications would cost us over $12,000 per year out-of-pocket.  This business had to be successful, not just from an ego perspective, but we needed to support our children.  Nothing motivates more than being forced into a &ldquo;win or wither&rdquo; situation.</p><h3> <strong>  Perspective </strong></h3><p> <br/> The famous Mike Tyson quote, &ldquo;Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth&rdquo; is cited over and over again by entrepreneurs trying to motivate themselves to not accept short-term failure as the end result, but just as one step in the journey to success.  You cannot allow yourself to fall into a pit of despair.  For me, having Layla to go home to every night puts it all in perspective.  In the past, if my day didn&rsquo;t go exactly according to plan, it would cripple me with anger and frustration, and ruin my entire evening.  Now, when I walk through the door and find our daughter hooked up to a feeding machine, not able to see or hear, sleeping peacefully on the couch with a big smile on her face, my petty &ldquo;problems&rdquo; disappear in a heartbeat.  I know that tomorrow is another day, and everything will be fine if I remain focused on the big picture and keep moving the company forward.</p><p> Would I give anything to have a healthy daughter?  You bet I would.  Could the timing have been better between starting a business and our daughter getting sick?  Of course it could have.  But life rarely, if ever, lays out the yellow brick road and shows us an easy, well-lit path to our dreams.  I have seen first-hand that the human spirit can endure more than we think imaginable.  Starting a company can feel impossible sometimes.  For many, it will be the most difficult thing you will do in your life.  Watching your child suffer day in and day out is the worst nightmare I can imagine for anyone.  But in some weird way, juggling both at the same time has miraculously lessened the pain of each, compared to attacking each struggle independently.  Maybe David Lee Roth was right all along: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to roll with the punches to get to what&rsquo;s real!&rdquo;</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 15:50:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 15:50:46.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_2WhRkGL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-my-special-needs-daughter-has-made-me-a-better-entrepreneur/\", \"post_id\": \"10989\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 15:50:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 15:50:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-my-special-needs-daughter-has-made-me-a-better-entrepreneur\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10988\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5373\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-My-Special-Needs-Daughter-Has-Made-Me-a-Better-Entrepreneur.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1129\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463079780,"author_id":333,"chart_url":""}

When a Gallup survey reports that only 30 percent of U.S. employees are engaged in their work what do you think that says about leadership engagement?</p><p> The question we would like to pose to you is simply this: are you checking in or checking out as a leader in the way you engage your people? Your answer matters because in it reside signals not just to your leadership style but to the health of your organization.</p><p> Here are a series of questions we would like to pose to you for your consideration; a check-up if you will as to your engagement levels with your people and the state of your leadership effectiveness.</p><h3> Do you know your employees on an individual basis?</h3><p> Like any smart leader in business you make it a priority to know your customer. Knowing your target audience is critical to your bottom line. If it is important to you to know your customer does it not stand to reason that you should know the people serving your customer?</p><p> When you don&rsquo;t take the time to get to know your employees on an individual basis, it clearly shows that you don&rsquo;t care. How hard will an employee work for a leader who does not care? You will not get anywhere near the productivity or quality you need from employees if you do not show that you care about their well-being.</p><p> <strong>  Check-In Tip: </strong> Get to know your employees on an individual basis. How are their families? What are their hobbies? How was their recent vacation?</p><h3> Do you know what is happening on the ground level?</h3><p> One of the dangers leaders can find themselves in is being too far removed from the front lines of the operation. We understand that the responsibilities you face as a leader in part take you away from the front lines so it must be a priority for you to return.</p><p> There is no way for you to know everything; when you distance yourself from what is happening on the ground level it&rsquo;s like putting blinders on. What issues might slip by you? What opportunities might you miss?</p><p> <strong>  Check-In Tip: </strong> Get out on the floor; make your presence the norm. Be observant and engaged with what is happening on the ground level.</p><h3> Do you have the right people in the right positions?</h3><p> Your effectiveness as an organization is realized not when you have a lot of people but when you have the right people in the right place. When people play to their strengths and are passionate about what they do then your organization will excel.</p><p> None of your employees want to be just a warm body, and most of your tasks require some form of specialized knowledge or skill. When you give little thought to where employees can make the greatest contribution to the organization, you are crippling your operations and minimizing the importance of individual contributions.</p><p> <strong>  Check-In Tip: </strong> Learn where your employees&rsquo; strengths lie. Then place them in positions where they will be engaged and challenged while making the greatest contribution to the organization.</p><h3> Can your employees count on you?</h3><p> The people in your organization need to know that you are a leader who is reliable and will have their backs. You foster trust and earn respect not merely by your words but in your day-to-day actions that demonstrate your commitment to their success.</p><p> If your employees don&rsquo;t feel they can count on you, we&rsquo;d be willing to bet that they won&rsquo;t go out of their way to be there for you either. If you send the message to your employees that it&rsquo;s every man for himself, be prepared to be left standing on your own.</p><p> <strong>  Check-In Tip: </strong> Show your employees that you have their backs; knowing that they can count on you is a key factor in gaining the trust and respect you need to be an effective leader.</p><p> So, are you checking in or are you checking out? As a leader, you are setting the example for employees to follow. If you are not connecting with your employees and engaging in operations at the ground level, your employees will follow suit. And, disengaged employees do not reflect well on any leader and do not benefit the organization as a whole.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 15:56:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 15:56:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_mRoAgZZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-checking-in-or-checking-out-as-a-leader-in-the-way-you-engage-your-people/\", \"post_id\": \"10990\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 15:56:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 15:56:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-checking-in-or-checking-out-as-a-leader-in-the-way-you-engage-your-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10988\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5374\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-My-Special-Needs-Daughter-Has-Made-Me-a-Better-Entrepreneur.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"562\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463076000,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5162,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A+ Ways to Use Your Time Wisely When It Comes to Wealth Management","link":"a-ways-to-use-your-time-wisely-when-it-comes-to-wealth-management","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives,&rdquo; said author Annie Dillard.</p><p> In fact, time is our most precious commodity. We regularly use words like &ldquo;spend,&rdquo; &ldquo;kill,&rdquo; and &ldquo;waste&rdquo; when we explain how we use the finite number of hours in our days. And the adage, &ldquo;time is money,&rdquo; certainly resonates when taking charge of financial affairs.</p><p> So, how can you use your time wisely when it comes to wealth management?</p><h3> 1. Be in the market for the long haul</h3><p> <br/> Market timing versus time in the market. In my opinion, being savvy about your financial future is not about trying to predict the best time to buy and sell stocks or bonds so that you can beat the market. Nor is it about determining the best time to start investing. Focus on the big picture, longevity, and creating an integrated financial plan that connects your life goals with your investments. Emphasize quality within your investment portfolio and plan to invest in the market for the long haul.</p><h3> 2. Keep your eye on the prize</h3><p> <br/> Are you about to send your child off to college, or are you evaluating when you want to retire? Procrastinating on planning and saving can limit your options. Use a strategic financial-planning framework to make it easier to prioritize and take action. For example, would you rather retire at age 57 with a pension of $4,600 per month, or wait until age 62 with a pension of $5,100 per month? There is no right or wrong answer. The right answer for you depends on your individual and family situation.</p><h3> 3. Understand the process of investing</h3><p> <br/> The biggest mistake people make is to postpone saving until they&rsquo;ve mastered the art of investing&mdash;and that can take a lifetime. Accept that you don&rsquo;t have to be an expert on all types of investments before you start saving for your future. Here are some strategies to help you harness your full potential:</p><li> If the idea of selecting good investments is overwhelming or confusing, just focus on the habit of saving. Activities we repeat on a regular basis become habits that we tend to perform almost unconsciously.</li><li> If you&rsquo;re enrolling in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, and you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable making investment choices immediately, consider a balanced fund (generally a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash) or a target-date retirement fund. In a target-date fund, your contributions are spread across different types of investments based on how many years you are from retirement, with the investment allocation becoming more conservative as you age. Review your 401(k) plan to evaluate your contribution rate and investment performance, and make adjustments on an annual basis.</li><li> If you don&rsquo;t have an employer-sponsored retirement plan, or if you&rsquo;re self-employed, you can accumulate wealth for retirement in an IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, or one of the many other types of tax-deferred retirement accounts. <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Be resilient</h3><p> <br/> The key to accomplishing this goal is to cultivate your investment knowledge and acumen while giving yourself permission to make some mistakes. And don&rsquo;t beat yourself up over past decisions! In my experience, I have seen too many people make long-term financial decisions in isolation. In his book Aging Well <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Aging-Well-Surprising-Guideposts-Development/dp/0316090077\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  , </a>  Harvard University psychologist George Vaillant describes resilient individuals as resembling &ldquo;a twig with a fresh, green living core.&rdquo; He explains that when twisted out of shape, such a twig bends, but it does not break; instead, it springs back and continues growing. Resilience is an important component of prudent wealth management.</p><h3> 5. Have a balanced spending approach</h3><p> <br/> Being balanced isn&rsquo;t about depriving oneself, or simply delayed gratification. It&rsquo;s about balancing consumption today with anticipated consumption in the future. While planning for the future is prudent, we all have to live life a little now!. For me, my green tea latte habit might seem extravagant to others, but when I have to get up early to take my son to swim practice, it brings serenity to my day.</p><h3> 6. Identify your core values</h3><p> <br/> Helping clients identify what they want most from their lives is the first step in helping them achieve their financial goals. It sounds simple, but all too often it&rsquo;s a challenge to know what you want, let alone to adopt a financial planning strategy that strengthens your resilience and helps you achieve your goals.

In fact, a lot of good can result for businesses that maintain active social profiles and allow their employees to do the same.</p><p> On the fence about whether to allow your employees to use social networks at work? Here are five reasons why social media should never be banned at the office:</p><h3> 1. It gives employees a short mental break</h3><p> You can&rsquo;t reasonably expect your employees to show up to the office, head to their desks, and work nonstop for eight or nine hours.</p><p> From time to time, everyone needs a short break to recharge their batteries. Whereas officemates gathered around the water cooler to chat in years past, today&rsquo;s office mingling takes place digitally on social media.</p><h3> 2. It can inspire constructive ideas</h3><p> Let your employees browse social media periodically throughout the day and you never know what they&rsquo;ll stumble across.</p><p> A lot of what they find will probably be mindless entertaining chatter. But every now and again, your employees will almost certainly come into contact with content that gives them a great idea for your brand. The better your employees are at navigating the choppy waters of social media, the more frequently these constructive ideas will emerge.</p><h3> 3. It keeps employees up-to-date on breaking news</h3><p> News breaks on social media. Just take a look at this Mashable article from 2013 that chronicles, among other things, the fact that the news of Prince William&rsquo;s engagement to Kate Middleton first emerged on Twitter.</p><p> It&rsquo;s definitely in your best interest for your employees to be on top of the latest developments in the world &mdash; both the good and the bad. By banning social media from your office, you&rsquo;re making it that much harder for your team to stay current.</p><p> In some cases, breaking news (such as the prince&rsquo;s engagement) can provide great marketing fodder that can help your brand capitalize on trending topics. Just be careful not to try too hard. And definitely don&rsquo;t exploit tragedies.  </p><h3> 4. It provides another way to engage with customers</h3><p> Whether you&rsquo;re B2B or B2C, your customers live on social media. There&rsquo;s no sense in preventing your employees from engaging with them on the platforms they are most comfortable with.</p><p> Do more than simply allow your employees to be on social media. Encourage them to create company-specific profiles. They then can use social networks to promote your brand, answer customer questions, and keep tabs on competitors.</p><h3> 5. It will demotivate your employees</h3><p> According to our Employee Engagement Report, work culture is strongly correlated with employee happiness. If you allow your work culture to evolve to the point where social networks &mdash; which are literally used by billions of people &mdash; are &ldquo;banned&rdquo; from your office, odds are morale is going to take a hit for the worse.</p><p> Because employee happiness is a critical element of employee engagement, this is nothing to take lightly. Don&rsquo;t make employee engagement any harder than it needs to be. Let your staff use social media (within reason), and you won&rsquo;t have this problem.  </p><p> Social media used to get a bad rap. But now sites like Twitter and Facebook have been around for longer than a decade. They&rsquo;ve matured, and it&rsquo;s time for your social media policy to do the same.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 17:17:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 17:17:16.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_u9Ee0nZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/banned-your-employees-from-facebook-at-work-5-reasons-social-media-should-be-allowed/\", \"post_id\": \"10995\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 17:17:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 17:17:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"banned-your-employees-from-facebook-at-work-5-reasons-social-media-should-be-allowed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10994\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5377\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Banned-Your-Employees-from-Facebook-at-Work-5-Reasons-Social-Media-Should-Be-Allowed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"901\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463061600,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s February 2016 and you&rsquo;re a writer in a marketing meeting to discuss the next batch of articles for your advisor publication, due for distribution in April. You&rsquo;re kicking around topics and decide it would be great for one article to highlight the benefits of investing in corporate class funds.</p><p> Brilliant! Your company recently launched a mini-suite of corporate class funds and minimizing taxes is always a popular subject. Even though you want to position the piece as something advisors can share with their clients, you realize another benefit of the article is that some advisors don&rsquo;t fully get the concept of a mutual fund corporation, so you can help sway them as well. </p><p> Your marketing manager pulls together some insights and data from partners around the organization, and builds the creative brief. You do a bit of extra research to flesh out the piece, craft an outline and then write the article. Your masterpiece makes the rounds until it&rsquo;s finally signed off. Satisfied, you put this article to bed and wait for it to appear in the April publication.</p><h3> Here comes the lemon</h3><p> <br/> March 22nd rolls around and the Federal Budget declares that the tax-deferral feature, which is a significant benefit of corporate class funds and a big reason why people invest in them, is going to be eliminated. You panic but then calmly go online to understand the tax measure a bit better, to see if it&rsquo;s as punitive as it seems. Yup, everyone&rsquo;s talking about how this move will be a game-changer. Your article must go to print the following week. Back to panic mode.</p><h3> Start making that pie</h3><p> <br/> After consulting with your team, you proceed with the article, but you&rsquo;ll remove the tasty bits about tax deferral and expand your focus on the remaining benefits of mutual fund corporations, such as the ability to shift income throughout the corporation so one class doesn&rsquo;t take on an excessive tax burden.</p><p> You get more creative and collaborate with your design team to create a cool visual that illustrates the benefits of income reallocation. You&rsquo;re still short on copy, so you venture out of your comfort zone and approach the head of your tax and estate team to get a nice quote about how corporate class funds are still useful in tax planning. Hey, this piece isn&rsquo;t a disaster after all. Maybe it&rsquo;s lost some punch, but you&rsquo;ve managed to have a nice recovery from what seemed like a big mess, and you still get the article to print on time.</p><p> It&rsquo;s natural to be flustered or upset when assignments don&rsquo;t go the way you had expected, but keep at it and find new ways to make your work count. Sometimes your revised piece will end up even stronger than the original. Sweet!</p><p> P.S.

{"original_id":5165,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why The Truth Is All You Need","link":"why-the-truth-is-all-you-need","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. An FBI supervisor happened to see me in the hall just as he was trying to identify an agent who could handle a discreet inquiry into an allegation that another FBI employee was involved in a fraud scheme.</h3><p> <br/> Touchy matter&mdash;for many reasons, but primarily because no one wants to be a modern day Thomas Cromwell and wield the hatchet for upper management. I wasn&rsquo;t so much &ldquo;asked&rdquo; as &ldquo;selected&rdquo; to be the investigative agent. Next thing I knew I was holding a new case file in my hand.</p><p> It turned out that a friend of the FBI employee had made the allegation after a rift in their relationship. I would need the employee&rsquo;s full disclosure of facts if we were to save her job.</p><p> There is always an awkward moment when you notify an individual that they are being investigated for breaking rules, or in this case, laws. Should you call them and arrange a meeting? Or simply drop by their office and hope for privacy? I chose to call and asked the woman to come to my office&mdash;immediately&mdash;about a pending personnel issue.</p><p> In my office, she denied any wrongdoing. As I probed further into the matter, it looked more like dishonesty than a fraud scheme&mdash;not commendable but certainly not worthy of any type of criminal charge.</p><p> When I met with the employee again, she continued to deny any wrongdoing. I explained that since the case did not meet the threshold of a crime, she would not be fired. But what I needed at this point from her was complete candor. I needed her to tell the truth.</p><p> There are many reasons to ask good questions:</p><h3> <strong>  1. I know at what point they start being deceitful in their answers </strong></h3><p> <br/> The employee denied signing documents that pointed to dishonest intentions when I had those same documents in my possession.</p><h3> <strong>  2. I can watch body language </strong></h3><p> <br/> This allows me to get familiar with their mannerism so I will more easily recognize changes in them, which can indicate deceit. Her hands were folded in her lap until we came to the topic of the signatures and then covered her lips with a forefinger &ndash; a signal that she was about to lie.</p><h3> <strong>  3. I can listen for verbal clues </strong></h3><p> <br/> People use different sentence structure and voice levels when they&rsquo;re stressed or deceitful. Her manner of speech became more formal as we talked about the signed documents.</p><p> Instead of telling me the truth, the FBI employee continued to lie. I went the supervisor who made an immediate decision to fire her&mdash;not because she was falsely accused of being involved in a fraud scheme or because she broke the law, but because of her lack of candor.</p><p> If an FBI employee shows  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2012/06/04/5-leadership-behaviors-loyal-employees-trust/\" target=\"_blank\">  lack of candor </a> , it is reason for automatic dismissal. It may sound harsh at first; this woman was fired when she had basically done nothing illegal. But she had lied, and in doing so, she had proven herself untrustworthy. She did not have the mental toughness to admit she had made a mistake.</p><p> How many of the difficulties you are struggling with could have been avoided by simply telling the truth? I have found that it&rsquo;s easier to fall on my sword and admit my mistake rather than trying to patch it over with a lie. People seek the truth, partly because it&rsquo;s become a rare commodity in so many areas of our lives these days.</p><p> Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s hard to correct a lie after you&rsquo;ve denied the truth because after a while, you start to believe the lie.</p><p> Most relationships are not entirely reciprocal because, one party usually wields more power over the others. This is particularly true for those in leadership positions. My FBI experience taught me that trust and respect are two-way streets. It&rsquo;s impossible to build one without the other.</p><p> We all take liberties with the truth at times, especially when we try to hide our faults and conceal our errors. But here are 5 things to remember about truth:</p><li> <strong>  The truth can be hard at first, but it&rsquo;s easier in the long run. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The truth is the beginning of freedom. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The truth is its own explanation. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The truth is the cure for confusion. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The truth is within you. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> I don&rsquo;t know whatever became of the FBI employee, and I don&rsquo;t know if she ever learned the hard lesson that it only takes one small truth to set a life straight.</p><p> When has telling the truth got you out of tight spot?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 17:25:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 17:25:23.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_3SDIKVq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-the-truth-is-all-you-need/\", \"post_id\": \"10999\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 17:25:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 17:25:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-the-truth-is-all-you-need\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10998\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5379\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-The-Truth-Is-All-You-Need.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"424\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463054400,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

Actually, there&rsquo;s a  <a href=\"http://www.thehalvening.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  few </a>  of them.  But, the reality is that no one actually knows exactly when it will occur.</p><p> So, what is &ldquo;Bitcoin halving day&rdquo;?</p><h3> Bitcoin&rsquo;s goal is to create a finite supply</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s take a look at why there&rsquo;s a need for &ldquo;halving&rdquo; of the amount of Bitcoins being mined.  It&rsquo;s all about controlling the supply of Bitcoin.</p><p> In the United States, we have the luxury of simply printing as much money as we like.  This means that the supply of money in this country is increasing.  This factors into inflation, increased debt and the interest in putting new (and worthy) people onto our printed money.</p><p> With Bitcoin, it&rsquo;s different. Bitcoin is produced through mining and this mining utilizes a computer program (the  <a href=\"http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bitcoin generation algorithm </a> ), that controls the creation of new Bitcoins.</p><p> At some point in time, there will be a finite amount of Bitcoin created and all mining of new Bitcoin will cease. This will create a finite supply of Bitcoin. </p><p> With a  <a href=\"http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  finite supply </a> , the amount of demand for Bitcoin will be the central driver for the value of the currency.  At that point, the total amount of Bitcoin at \"completion\" will be 21 million Bitcoins and no new ones will be created.</p><p> For many people in the Bitcoin community, the ability to be moving closer to &ldquo;completion&rdquo; of the Bitcoin process is a major achievement and validation of the concept and its impact on society and the financial world.  After all, if Bitcoin was actually dead and of little value (as many skeptics think), the &ldquo;completion&rdquo; of the Bitcoin supply would be a non-issue and perhaps, it may not have even occurred if there was little interest in, or need for, Bitcoin.</p><p> No one actually knows when the last Bitcoin will be created, just as no one knows exactly when the &ldquo;halving&rdquo; of Bitcoins will occur (but the &lsquo;countdown&rsquo; websites are sort of neat). This all depends on the mining process.  However, according to those who track this stuff, the &ldquo;completion&rdquo; of Bitcoin is estimated to  <a href=\"http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Help:FAQ#How_long_will_it_take_to_generate_all_the_coins.3F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  occur in 2140 </a> . </p><h3> What is &ldquo;Bitcoin halving&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> When a Bitcoin miner creates a Bitcoin through their use of the algorithm, they are rewarded with a new  <a href=\"http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;block&rdquo; </a>  of the currency.  The developers and maintainers of the Bitcoin algorithm took into consideration the amount of mining power and capacity that may be available in the network to provide &ldquo;stability&rdquo; to the creation process and to prolong the creation process to &ldquo;completion&rdquo;.</p><p> Thus, the algorithm actually adjusts to keep the block creation process constant over periods of time as it heads towards the &ldquo; <a href=\"http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  completion </a> &rdquo; total of 21 million Bitcoin. </p><p> Built into the algorithm is the ability for this &ldquo;block creation&rdquo; process to be decreased 50% at four-year intervals (or every 210,000 blocks).  Currently, miners are rewarded with 25 BTC per block created.  This amount has been steady for the last four years, and 2016 is estimated to be the year when that reward will be decreased to 12.5 BTC per block. </p><p> That&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bitcoin halving&rdquo;.</p><h3> Will &ldquo;halving&rdquo; be good or bad for the value of Bitcoin?</h3><p> <br/> The fact that the supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half at some point in 2016 is getting  <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-happen-to-bitcoins-price-after-the-halving-in-mid-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  many people </a>  thinking that this decreased supply of Bitcoin will lead to an  <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-05-08/mother-all-short-squeezes-looms-bitcoin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  increase in the value </a>  and price of Bitcoin. </p><p> The first (and most recent) &ldquo;halving day&rdquo; took place in  <a href=\"http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Halving_day_2012\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2012 </a>  and it had no immediate  <a href=\"http://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/will-the-upcoming-mining-reward-halving-impact-bitcoin-s-price-1455126224\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  impact </a>  on the price of bitcoin (it was valued at $13.40 per BTC then). However, the price of Bitcoin is now around $450 and has gained more interest and usage by many since four years ago.</p><p> The estimates for the value of Bitcoin vary greatly, but the one thing that will be known for sure is that at some point in time, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins created. What we&rsquo;re doing with those Bitcoins and what they&rsquo;ll be worth in 2140 will probably be unknown by those of us reading this. </p><p> That is of course, if Bitcoin is still around then.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 17:29:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 17:29:14.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_JCYLjyR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/bitcoin-will-halving-be-good-or-bad-for-the-value/\", \"post_id\": \"11000\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 17:29:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 17:29:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"bitcoin-will-halving-be-good-or-bad-for-the-value\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"10998\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5380\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-The-Truth-Is-All-You-Need.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1528\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463050800,"author_id":205,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5167,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Use Social Media More Effectively to Generate Sales","link":"how-to-use-social-media-more-effectively-to-generate-sales","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Social media is a beast of a tool, but most just don&rsquo;t know how to use it effectively. Contrary to the many naysayers, social is an extremely useful tool to increase revenues. It&rsquo;s not just a hotbed of cluttered content. It&rsquo;s a place to connect and engage with your audience, and drive sales too.</p><p> As social media matures, companies are mastering conversions and increasing customer acquisition. But the lack of concrete ROI numbers leaves many businesses skeptical to its pervasive power and reach.</p><p> To help businesses better understand social&rsquo;s influence for gaining new customers, on December 2nd Fanatics Media CEO, Mark Fidelman, sat down with Jon Ferrara, Daniel Tautges, and Vala Afshar to help define the big picture of customer acquisition potential through social media.</p><p> As Mark put it, &ldquo;If you sell anything, this is an episode you don&rsquo;t want to miss out on.&rdquo; </p><p> Jon Ferrara is the Founder of GoldMine, one of the first ever contact management apps, and the current CEO of Nimble, one of the leading social CRM tools on the market for small businesses. This pioneer in the CRM industry has more than 20 years of experience in influencing customer relationship management and sales force automation technology and techniques.</p><p> Daniel Tautges is the President and CEO of Pinpoint Worldwide, a software business acceleration company, and Fanatics Media&rsquo;s own Chief Operating Officer. In addition to also Co-Founding Fanzeal, Daniel is an author with more than two decades of experience in global management of advanced technology industries and excels at building and managing world-wide markets.</p><p> Vala Afshar is the Chief Digital Evangelist for Salesforce, the former CMO of Extreme Networks, and author of &ldquo;The Pursuit of Social Business Excellence&rdquo;. Vala is also contributes to various publications including Huffington Post, INC Magazine, and other where he discusses technology, business, and leadership. With Slideshare presentations nearing the 2 million mar, Vala has some highly sought-after insights to share.</p><h3> Question #1: How Have Sales Evolved in the Last 12 Months?</h3><p> <br/> Jon shared, &ldquo;I think people have woken up to the fact that service is the new sales.&rdquo; and, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not entering every sales opportunity with the intent to help that person grow, you&rsquo;re failing as a salesperson.&rdquo; Firmly believing that there is a current renaissance happening in how relationships are managed, Jon stated that people are beginning to see the value of an individual&rsquo;s social network.</p><p> Vala stated that communities and customer engagement have become more important than ever before as a way for a company to deliver the brand&rsquo;s promise. He articulated that customers are more connected and informed through social media, which is the number one way people use the internet.</p><p> Daniel believed the most noticeable evolution has come through the customer; people are more educated on brands and products than at any point prior. He pointed out how authoritative and dynamic social media and content have become and stated, &ldquo;The reliance on digital media has gone supernova, and social, because that&rsquo;s the way they are informing customers now.&rdquo; Through these channel of communication he stated that the customer has come to know a business&rsquo;s products just as well as the brand itself.</p><h3> Question #2: What&rsquo;s New in Social Selling and What&rsquo;s on the Horizon?</h3><p> <br/> Jon declared, &ldquo;What I see that&rsquo;s new that I&rsquo;m not really liking is the automation. I think that people smell it when it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, when it&rsquo;s not human. And I think that the more digital we get, the more human we need to be.&rdquo; He echoed his disdain for emails that are not personalized or reflect that the sender has not thought through who he is and how they intend to help him grow. He proclaimed that in order to be successful connecting with someone through email, people need to reach out in an authentic and relevant way as well as follow up and follow through on all promises. He also stated that sales people need to become their own marketers in a sense and that if automation is used it absolutely must be tailored.</p><p> Mark added to the topic and asked, &ldquo;Is sales and marketing going to combine at some point?&rdquo;</p><p> Vala said yes. At a previous company, he found that inside sales teams were integrated with marketing; this ultimately boosted conversions and the quality of leads. He also noted that current technologies are pushing in the direction of this type of merger and it will enhance communications over time. Vala asserted, &ldquo;Revenue is more important that qualified leads&rdquo;</p><p> Jon stated that sales and marketing have been intertwined for a long time, however, companies still need marketing departments and that sales people should not become full-fledged marketers. Instead, the two groups should be working together more closely on the vision and message of the company and that sales people should be sharing curated content to help educate customers. He emphasized, &ldquo;I believe a company brand is built on the promises you make and the experiences that you deliver.&rdquo; These building blocks are delivered through the customer-facing members of an organization and the more human a company is, the more people will connect with it.</p><h3> Question #3: Why Hasn&rsquo;t Everyone Embraced Social Sales Yet?</h3><p> <br/> Daniel remarked, &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s still a paradigm between what you want your sales people doing and what do you want your marketing people doing and I want my marking people marketing and my sales people selling. When you start to converge those things, what ends up happening is it breaks.&rdquo;  To drive his point home, he reflected on how he made a call to a company with the purpose of having them walk him through the sales process as a customer and the business would ultimately be scored on a one hundred point checklist. Daniel stated the person he received was clearly either a marketer or an uneducated sales person as they had no idea on how to close.</p><p> Jon intervened, pointing out that today&rsquo;s educated customers do not want to speak with sales people, they want experts. Additionally, Jon stated that he himself does not want sales people talking to customers, he wants&ldquo;customer wow-people&rdquo;; individuals who understand the customer journey. He discussed how at GoldMine he would hire people who were remarkable at customer interactions, despite their current occupation, and teach them the technology.</p><p> Vala explained that one of the great aspects of individuals who are just now graduating college and coming into the field is that they are digital natives and don&rsquo;t need to be told how important social is. He expressed that it is crucial to leverage as many social channels as possible to gain a deeper understanding of the different buyer personas and processes as well as to interpret how and when to deliver the right content to the right people across the right channels. For businesses to make a lasting and meaningful impact, they have to be able to speak the customer&rsquo;s language and position themselves as a trusted advisor. &ldquo;Trust is the currency in the hyper-connected, knowledge sharing world that we live in, and social just enables that.&rdquo;</p><h3> Question #4: What are some of the Specific Activities that you or Your Customers are Doing to Drive Revenue?</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Part of making meaningful connections is understanding our customer&rsquo;s narratives.&rdquo; Vala advised to nurture the connections you have already established and to always seek to share useful information that will help others grow. He expressed this sentiment when he stated, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not helpful, you&rsquo;re not influential.&rdquo; He felt that every person you help can potentially increase your circle of influence and described just how useful various social channels have been for him personally. &ldquo;Wherever you are, make sure you are sharing interesting content that can help people grow, and if you follow that rule I think you&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;</p><p> Jon expressed his love of Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn while he advised to use all available channels that customers are on. It is a way to understand and connect with others. But these devices aren&rsquo;t solely for business, they should be utilized personally as well so that followers can connect with people on a human level. He expressed that every business person should have personal and professional landing pages for all of their digital properties, otherwise, they are missing out on a huge opportunity to stay top-of-mind.</p><p> Jon maintained that through identifying key influencers, building relationships, utilizing every means possible, and consistently sharing content relevant to your niche, it will help to maximize growth.</p><p> Mark asked Vala and Daniel if they agreed and if these activities can be traced back to customer acquisition.</p><p> Vala echoed yes, and share that Salesforce has spent $4 billion in marketing technologies to help measure influence across social networks. He stated, &ldquo;The science has absolutely evolved today where you can point to not only buying signals from various social networks but actually mapping those buying signals to existing opportunities, contacts, and accounts. No question.&rdquo;</p><p> Daniel called it an in-house problem, sharing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s promoted internally. I&rsquo;m not sure companies are actually promoting it.&rdquo; He compounded this by stating that if his sales people are on Twitter and meeting their quotas, all is well and good, however, if the numbers are not met he is willing to look at behaviors.</p><p> Jon disagreed with this mentality and again asserted that if sales people post curated content, they will begin to build their personal brands alongside building the company&rsquo;s brand. He added that Salesforce and LinkedIn are spending billions of dollars to educate people on the power of social media.</p><p> Vala proclaimed, &ldquo;Look, how much data points do you need? In august 1 out of 7 people on Earth in one day were on Facebook. You had a billion people active on a social network in a single day.&rdquo; Simply put, if you&rsquo;re not on social media, you won&rsquo;t be around long or at least achieve your full potential.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 17:32:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 17:32:23.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_a2ZjT98.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-use-social-media-more-effectively-to-generate-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"11002\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 17:32:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 17:32:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-use-social-media-more-effectively-to-generate-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11001\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5381\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Use-Social-Media-More-Effectively-to-Generate-Sales.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2280\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463079600,"author_id":484,"chart_url":""}

Countless case studies repeatedly show mom and pop stores go from barely getting by to exponential growth solely through web traffic.</p><p> Just imagine if you could do the same&hellip; </p><p> Imagine the power &ndash; the flexibility &ndash; that would come with being able to generate customers repeatedly solely through the internet.</p><p> Sounds great, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> Well fortunately, I&rsquo;ve got good news for you. As far-out as many of the success stories sound, they all have one thing in common: A strategically executed plan.</p><p> This post is going to show you how to create your own strategy plan.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re a fan of SEO, email marketing, blogging, or social media, this plan works to guide your every effort &ndash; and ensure you&rsquo;re not wasting time and resources.</p><p> So follow along as I share with you the 7 steps to crafting your own powerful online marketing strategy designed to reel in new business.</p><p> Feel free to take notes but just an FYI, at the end of this post I&rsquo;ve compiled all 7 steps into a downloadable PDF checklist.</p><p> And with all that covered, here&rsquo;s step 1&hellip;</p><h3> #1. Break Down Your Audience</h3><p> When it comes to one-on-one interactions with clients or prospects, it&rsquo;s easy to personalize your services to their needs.</p><p> As a website, however, you&rsquo;re now opening yourself up for the entire world to see. As such, the more generalized, vague, and broader your target message, the more likely you&rsquo;ll appeal to few, if any, visitors.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital to break down your web audience and pinpoint exactly who you want to appeal to.</p><p> Creating separate web sections or pages for specific audience types allows you to write to their specific, individual needs, wants, and desires. This, consequently, will likely raise your conversion and engagement rate online.</p><p> For example, if you run a plant nursery you&rsquo;ll likely have a variety of customers:</p><li> First time plant buyers (likely spurred on by a new house/garden)</li><li> Frequent plant buyers shopping around for a new store location or a specific product</li><li> Hobbyists / Professionals looking to buy more advanced products</li><p> Now if your website aims to address the needs of all three audiences on each and every page, that&rsquo;s a lot of unnecessary content that one segment will have to read to get to the stuff they actually care about.</p><p> As such, bounce rate and exits will probably catapult.</p><p> Creating separate web pages and content hubs for each of these segments will do much better for your key business objectives.</p><p> What&rsquo;s more, creating these segments arms your strategy and allows you to further personalize everything you do (emails, banner ads, etc).</p><p> I recommend checking out my post on Industry Insight to get a better feel for your audience and how to break it down into practical, effective audience segments.</p><p> This industry insight will help for content creation, keyword research, email marketing, and serve as a valuable tool for future success.</p><p> As I mention in the post, customer behavior has a tendency to repeat itself.</p><p> By using similar words, headlines, and content that&rsquo;s historically proven to work with your audience, you&rsquo;re much more likely to attract and convert customers online.</p><p> This, naturally, alleviates one of the most common mistakes business owners make with the words they use online.</p><p> It goes by the nickname &lsquo;corporate talk&rsquo;. I recommend the following&hellip;</p><h3> #2. Grab a Machete and Cut Off That Corporate Tongue</h3><p> &ldquo;We are the innovative leader in XYZ for 30+ years&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;It is our commitment to provide excellence and superior service to our every client.&rdquo;</p><p> Ever see a company website with words like the above? It&rsquo;s what copywriters call &ldquo;corporate talk&rdquo; &ndash;  and we hate it.</p><p> In an effort to sound professional and authoritative, corporate talk uses big fancy words to say absolutely nothing meaningful or specific.</p><p> Simply put, it&rsquo;s superficial drab with no substance &ndash; like a supermodel with beauty but no brains.</p><p> While many larger corporates find themselves using this type of copy, they&rsquo;re not the worst culprits. It&rsquo;s the small business owners acting like corporate, big businesses.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an illustration.</p><p> You visit a car repair shop and are introduced by  a humble dude named John with a stutter and a crooked smile. John warmly greets you and navigates you through his office to the garage. Here he pulls out a big box filled with several metallic car parts. He then holds one circular tube and demonstrates why this caused your car to break down and how he fixed it.</p><p> You can tell John truly cares about your car and did everything in his power to make it work as smoothly as possible.</p><p> And he&rsquo;s killing it offline &ndash; but not so much online.</p><p> Online, John wants to look like a pro. So he set his website up with a fancy logo, web design, and professional &ldquo;corporate talk&rdquo; to give the perception that he&rsquo;s just like the 21,039 square feet auto shops in town.</p><p> Nowhere does his site feature his image, his personality, or anything even remotely related to the unique experience you get at his shop.</p><p> You see the problem?</p><p> John, like many business owners, is too focused on giving customers an illusion of &ldquo;success&rdquo; rather than addressing the key needs, wants, and desires they&rsquo;re looking to solve.</p><p> Or as Larry Bossidy says, &ldquo;People tend to look at their businesses from the inside out- that is, they get so focused on making and selling their products that they lose awareness of the needs and buying behaviors of their customers&rdquo;</p><p> There&rsquo;s another even bigger problem to &ldquo;corporate talk&rdquo;.</p><p> In an attempt to seem professional and authoritative, you end up completely destroying the Unique Selling Proposition that customers likely recognize you by.</p><p> In the example above, John sidestepped his most prized sales appeal (his passion and desire to serve the customer) and instead used the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m professional and an authority&rdquo; angle &ndash; an angle that the big dogs in town are most definitely using. And there is absolutely no way John could compete on that USP (Unique selling proposition).</p><p> It&rsquo;s like a small grocery store trying to compete against Wal-Mart on price &ndash; it&rsquo;s a death wish.</p><p> To attract and convert customers online, start by highlighting the values and Unique Selling Proposition customers already know you best by.</p><p> So what happens when you inject a powerful USP that&rsquo;s catered to your audience&rsquo;s needs and your best selling points?</p><p> It&rsquo;s a fact that you can expect, on average, 1-5% of cold visitors to convert into customers.</p><p> Not much, right?</p><p> That means 95% of visitors will leave your site without having done anything!</p><p> And as small business starting out with little or no traffic, that can mean months of traffic before a first sale.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve got to be smart with that 95%&hellip;. you&rsquo;ve got to give them a hook.</p><h3> #3. Give Unmotivated Web Visitors a Hook</h3><p> Back when I first got into internet marketing in 2007, the popular mantra most marketers followed was simple: get more leads and sales.</p><p> Website converts at 5%, leaving 95% of visitors unsatisfied? No problem. Just spend some money and drive online ad traffic to your page.</p><p> By following this process and writing strong, result-oriented copy, I made around $20,000 from a simple one-page web page sales letter, 10 pages long.</p><p> Fast-forward to today and this process just doesn&rsquo;t cut it anymore &ndash; especially as a small business. Ad rates have soared, one-page sales letter websites have been penalized in Google, and consumers are getting more savvy on hype.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s critical that you give that 95% of unconverted visitors a hook.</p><p> They may not take out their wallet and buy from you, but they&rsquo;ll be much more likely to engage with free eBooks, blog posts, videos, freebies, and special offers. Give them enough value and they&rsquo;ll likely either give you their email address or follow you on social media.</p><p> When you get this type of relationship started, you can then ask for a sale any time you&rsquo;d like. What&rsquo;s more, this then allows you to continue communicating with your audience and build a strong brand relationship.</p><p> So how do you get web visitors to check out this content?</p><h3> #4. Harness Your Unhatched Potential</h3><p> With all the hype and promotions out there for Adwords, Banner Ads, and social media advertising, it&rsquo;s enticing to want to jump in and spend money driving traffic to your website.</p><p> Hold on just one sec!</p><p> If you&rsquo;re just getting started attracting customers online, spending money on online ads is one of the biggest mistakes you can make.</p><p> Question: how many current customers visit your site?</p><p> If the answer is not much, there&rsquo;s a problem here.</p><p> Customers are the people most likely to do anything on your site, from downloading a whitepaper, commenting on a blog post, to share an article.</p><p> If your current or past customers aren&rsquo;t doing anything on your site (and these are the people most passionate about your business), how do you expect strangers to do it?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p><p> Gurus online like to make it seem like it&rsquo;s easier to do work online to attract new customers. In my experience, creating the most ROI-positive results online comes from playing with the assets you already have. Email lists. Customers. Relationships with other vendors.</p><p> Start with your past and current business first.</p><p> Have a list of customer emails or addresses? If so, you could easily set up a message promoting your site content and immediately gain followers within weeks.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t collected customer contact information, start there.</p><p> A website is not some isolated island from your business.</p><p>  </p><p> ive customers and prospects an incentive to visit your site. For example, if you host monthly events, you could require registration online and require an email address.</p><p> Send an email to these registrants and they&rsquo;ll be 2-3 times as likely to engage in your content than strangers that met your business online.</p><p> This is money sitting in your backyard unexploited. So grab that shovel, pad up that email list, and work to do the following&hellip;</p><h3> #5. Build an Embedded Online Presence</h3><p> In a riveting research study, Brian Uzzi revealed how embeddedness directly shapes organizational and economic outcomes.</p><p> Summing up the study, it was found that organizations with close ties to clients, distributors and providers had better:</p><li> Time economy</li><li> Integrative agreements</li><li> Improved efficiency</li><li> An intricate adaption process.</li><p> Organizations without these close ties (aka they ran business deals more transactional and cold) lacked these benefits.</p><p> I need not explain to you the benefits of word and mouth marketing for small business success.</p><p> The fallacy is to think the internet is different. That you can just plug some funnels and strategies on your site and generate a whopping amount of sales, leads and engagement.</p><p> True online success takes the same relationship embeddedness.</p><p> Each purchase on your site, consequently, should be treated as more than just a transaction. It&rsquo;s a real interaction with a real person. As such, work to turn that interaction into a real relationship and you&rsquo;ll get far more from each dollar spent in digital media.</p><p> The more embedded you become in web visitors lives, the better.</p><p> Of course, building strong  relationships with visitors is easier said than done. So how do you execute the process of building an embedded relationship with online visitors?</p><p> That&rsquo;s where the road map guiding your path to growth and business success gets to business&hellip;</p><h3> #6. Ensure you have a road map for online work</h3><p> It&rsquo;s easy to execute digital marketing tactics (link building, social media posting, blog commenting) and feel like you&rsquo;re doing something&hellip; only to end up with few if any results.</p><p> The truth is there are really only a few core sets of activities that really make impact. These core activities, however, usually aren&rsquo;t the most fun.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve worked in sales, you know what I&rsquo;m getting at.</p><p> &ldquo;Cold call&hellip; Yes, I need to do that. But first let me format my excel doc so it&rsquo;s easier. It&rsquo;ll streamline the process &ndash; definitely!&rdquo;</p><p> With no direct road map to guide your efforts, this type of time-wasting will kill productivity and the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll reach success online.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital that you set up hard-set goals and objectives. If an activity doesn&rsquo;t directly lead to this goal, cut it.</p><p> Starting out, every minute matters. Spend wisely.</p><p> Strategy, however, can be akin to phone makers creating a phone that&rsquo;ll survive a drop from the Eiffel tower. No matter how much strategy and research went into that gadget, you won&rsquo;t know if it does its job until you drop it from that tower.</p><h3> #7. Make Sure You Have Measurement In Place</h3><p> Whatever means you&rsquo;re using to generate sales, you know the importance of measuring those efforts to see what&rsquo;s working and what isn&rsquo;t.</p><p> Your website should be held to those same standards.</p><p> Treat your website like a virtual salesman with real goals to reach. This will force you (or whoever&rsquo;s running your website) to show that whatever work being done is directly influencing leads, sales, or traffic.</p><p> If your virtual salesman fails to meet the goals, try something else.</p><p> Treating your website like a virtual salesman proactively keeps that from happening.</p><h3> Are You Ready to Face These 7 Beasts?</h3><p> So we&rsquo;ve just covered 7 beasts that, if you can conquer, will make turning web visitors into customers easy as pie.</p><p> To recap:</p><li> Break down your audience segments and use this to structure your web content and layout</li><li> Avoid &ldquo;corporate talk&rdquo;. Speak to your consumers needs, wants and desires (and ensure you&rsquo;re using the USP that resonates best with your current business strengths)</li><li> Give unconverted visitors a soft HOOK for building a relationship</li><li>  Get your current customers to use your site before spending any money on advertising. If your customers don&rsquo;t like your site, strangers probably won&rsquo;t either.</li><li> Work to build an embedded relationship with visitors &ndash; not a transaction-based one</li><li> Ensure you have a strategy in place that filters out time-wasting digital work</li><li> Treat your website like a virtual salesman and hold it up to some standards</li><p> Implementing these 7 tactics to your digital marketing is no child&rsquo;s play. But if you can face this demon head on and succeed, you can become one of the few small business owners that thrives online.</p><p> With that comes an automated channel for new sales, leads and business opportunities. And more important, it allows you to better communicate and nurture current customers already doing business with you.</p><p> It can literally transform your business and take you to a whole new level of performance.</p><p> My advice?</p><p> Get started and get started now. The sooner you plant your seeds for success, the stronger your roots will grow as the days roll on.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 17:36:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 17:36:23.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_L35N9sh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/website-visitors-not-turning-into-customers-7-strategies-to-make-it-happen/\", \"post_id\": \"11004\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 17:36:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 17:36:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"website-visitors-not-turning-into-customers-7-strategies-to-make-it-happen\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11003\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5382\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Website-Visitors-Not-Turning-into-Customers-7-Strategies-to-Make-It-Happen.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"466\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463068800,"author_id":20,"chart_url":""}

We hate the customer service rep that is just going through the motions without any sincere care for the customer. We try to avoid the employee with an attitude (a bad one) that doesn&rsquo;t understand that his or her job is to help ensure the customer wants to come back the next time he or she needs whatever it is the company sells. We all have stories of why we won&rsquo;t go back to a place of business.</p><h3> But what happens when a person has a good attitude, but just can&rsquo;t deliver the service we want and expect?</h3><p> <br/> Just the other day I was having lunch at a local restaurant. The server was very pleasant. She warmly greeted us and smiled as she took our order. She even joked with us. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken and a vinaigrette dressing. My friend ordered a similar salad. When she brought the salads, mine had a creamy blue cheese dressing. My friend&rsquo;s salad was a small side salad, not a regular size. We pointed this out to the server, and she wasn&rsquo;t sure how to react. She just said, &ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know how that happened,&rdquo; and took the salads away.</p><p> Both of our meals came out the wrong way, but our server still had an engaging smile and friendly personality. She eventually brought out a second round of salads. Mine was correct, but my buddy&rsquo;s was a completely different salad than what he had ordered. She said, once again, &ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know how that happened.&rdquo;</p><p> In the end, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9p-cb6lTWu4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  bad service </a> . I&rsquo;d call it incompetent service. And there is a difference.</p><p> Now, some of you might blame the kitchen staff for sending out the wrong food. Yes, we can assign some of the blame to them, but, the biggest assignment of blame goes to our server. Nice as she was, she didn&rsquo;t check to see that the order was correct when it came out. She should have noticed before she placed the food in front of us.</p><p> This is a classic case of incompetent service, which some might say is the same thing as bad service, but again I think there is a difference.</p><p> <strong>  Bad service doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you don&rsquo;t get what you want. </strong> It can be that the attitude of the person serving you might not meet your expectations. Using the salad story, if the salads came out right, yet the server had a bad attitude, no matter how good the food was and how flawless she was in her technical serving abilities, her attitude would ruin the experience.</p><p> <strong>  Incompetent service is about mistakes. </strong> The attitude can be great, but the execution doesn&rsquo;t meet expectations. The good news is that a good attitude can help overcome mistakes, unless the mistakes keep piling up.</p><p> Either way, bad service or incompetent service is not acceptable. It erodes  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-confidence/guarantee-your-products-and-service-to-create-customer-confidence/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  confidence </a>  and could cause a customer to not want to come back. <strong>  The remedy: A great attitude and flawless execution.

It allows me to make a real difference, work with driven, motivated professionals, and see them grow and expand their abilities in the process. I also love it because it is one of the most direct ways in which I can demonstrate the full impact of what I do to a new (or existing) client.</p><p> Clients are often surprised by the effect of sales coaching, both in terms of &ldquo;hard numbers,&rdquo; as well as the changes they see in the people being coached.</p><p> Before the start of virtually every engagement, I find there are five common myths about sales coaching I need to clear up. In spite of the increasing use of coaching as a method for improving individual and organizational performance, when it comes to sales coaching, I find these same things come up in conversations over and over again.</p><h3> <strong>  Debunking 5 Sales Coaching Myths </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. &ldquo;Sales coaching is just like every other type of coaching&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> In addition to training and consulting with clients on how to improve across-the-board sales performance, sales coaching is a big part of what I do.</p><p> My sales experience plays a major role when I do sales coaching. Unlike other forms of coaching&mdash;such as executive coaching&mdash;sales coaching is about producing both long-term behavioral change, as well as short-term measurable and quantifiable increases in sales.</p><p> In order to do that, the coach must have a track record, experience, and credibility in sales.</p><p> In our first few sessions, I help coaching clients set individuals goals and develop a connection from their sales efforts to the achievement of their personal objectives. After that, sales coaching is highly operational, focused on results and designed to improve individual performance. Nuts-and-bolts kind of stuff.</p><h3> 2. &ldquo;Sales coaching is expensive&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> My dad used to say, &ldquo;Son, one day you will learn that it takes money to make money.&rdquo; And when clients inquire about the investment required for one-on-one sales coaching, they sometimes feel that investment is &ldquo;on the high side&rdquo; (as one client diplomatically put it).</p><p> And it&rsquo;s an arguable point&mdash;until we start looking at the numbers. According to the ICF, the vast majority of companies (86%) indicate that their company has at least made their investment back. In fact, almost one-fifth (19%) indicate an ROI of at least 50 times the initial investment, while a further 28% see an ROI of 10 to 49 times the investment. The median company return is 700%, indicating that a company can typicallyexpect a return of 7 times the initial investment in coaching.*</p><p> Our own clients report between a 25% to 40% increase in sales activity, leads generated, average deal size, and close ratio&mdash;and successes such as:</p><li> A human resources firm increased the number of prospect meetings set by just over 500% a short time after starting coaching.</li><li> A major engineering firm increased the size of one of its strategic accounts from $250,000 to $3.5 million in a several-year period, and it grew its strategic accounts 110% overall. During the same period, the rest of its accounts (whose account managers did not participate in a coaching and training process) grew at only 4%.</li><li> A municipal contractor was being terminated from a multi-year contract because a new city director wanted to take a different path. Our client was ready to accept the loss without a fight. During our coaching discussion, we strategized how to save the contract. Our client then successfully engaged the new director and communicated the return on investment realized by his work. The RFP was rescinded, and the client retained a revenue stream that will yield over $2,500,000 in the coming years.3&ldquo;Sales coaching is a cure-all for everyone.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> 3. &ldquo;Sales coaching is a cure-all for everyone&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Sales coaching is a scalpel, not a hack saw, which means that it&rsquo;s best used with specific individuals, in specific situations, and with specific outcomes in mind.</p><p> Sales coaching will not help you overcome problems related to employee engagement. It will not help you correct the wrong rewards policy. It will not make up for having a faulty or sub-par product.</p><p> Sales coaching is not a magic bullet.</p><p> Sometimes prospects ask me to draft a proposal to &ldquo;coach 75 of my salespeople.&rdquo; And my response is always the same: &ldquo;Why would you want to coach 75 of your salespeople?&rdquo; In situations like this, I always recommend doing an assessment first (to lay a solid foundation for sales coaching), selecting a small &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; group (to produce results and build the business case on a small scale first), and making it a self-elected process (to make sure we&rsquo;re focusing on the individuals who are most likely to produce exceptional results for themselves and their firm).</p><p> Like most things in business (and life), 80% of the results from sales coaching are derived from 20% of the investment/people/issues/clients. Think scalpel, not hack saw.</p><h3> 4. &ldquo;Sales coaching is about asking great questions and listening&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> As a sales coach, I am hired by firms and individuals to accomplish one simple goal: to increase sales and revenue as much as possible in as short a timeframe as possible. That&rsquo;s it.</p><p> Which means that if&mdash;based on my experience, track record, results, and the research we do at RAIN Group&mdash;I see a better, faster, more effective way of doing things, I have an obligation to speak up and point my coachees in the right direction.</p><p> Because, truth is, if I let my clients &ldquo;discover their own true path,&rdquo; sales opportunities will disappear, clients will be lost, and the competition will have moved in.</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t listen. It doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t ask enlightening, exploratory questions designed to help my clients deepen their understanding and insight. It doesn&rsquo;t mean I am disrespectful or dogmatic.</p><p> It simply means that I will recommend, I will suggest, and I will (sometimes) insist if I know there is a better way.</p><h3> 5. &ldquo;Sales coaching is (pretty much) deal coaching&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> While it is certainly true that a lot of sales coaching revolves around&mdash;and involves&mdash;deal coaching, that&rsquo;s not the full story.</p><p> A sales coach will help coachees: Define goals and build an action plan to achieve them. Develop a deeper understanding of what intrinsically and extrinsically motivates them. Build their resilience in the face of resistance, and help them maintain courage when (inevitable) momentary setbacks occur. And grow their knowledge, skills, and insight in the process.</p><p> Sales coaching is a specific form of intervention suitable for specific situations, goals, organizations, and people. When all these elements align, I know of no more powerful, impactful and gainful way of increasing short-term revenue and sales.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-11 17:57:10.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-11 17:57:10.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_vGKNhL3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/debunking-5-sales-coaching-myths-that-need-clearing-up/\", \"post_id\": \"11007\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-11 17:57:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-11 17:57:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"debunking-5-sales-coaching-myths-that-need-clearing-up\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11006\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5384\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Debunking-5-Sales-Coaching-Myths-That-Need-Clearing-Up.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"656\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463072400,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5171,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways to Stop Overthinking and Become More Productive","link":"5-ways-to-stop-overthinking-and-become-more-productive","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Raise your hand if one of these sounds like you:</p><li> You type an email, edit and revise endlessly, debate for hours whether to click &ldquo;send,&rdquo; then end up storing it in your drafts folder for later.</li><li> You receive an exciting invitation but debate the pros and cons for so long that the opportunity passes.</li><li> You hear good news, and your mind immediately goes to the questions: What does this mean for your future? Your family? Your job? Every other possible contingency?</li><li> You leave a conversation unsettled, then for the next week think of dozens of things you could have said instead. <br/>  </li><h3> Thinking is good and, frankly, you can probably bring to mind a few people who would benefit from exercising a bit more thought. Overthinking, however, can undermine our self-confidence, diminish our decision-making ability and waste a lot of time.</h3><p> <br/> As a former overthinker, I know this all too well.</p><p> Fortunately, you can curb overthinking and free up precious mental space for more productive things. Experiment with these five ideas for starters:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Take action. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Whenever I make a decision, I immediately take an action in favor of it &ndash; to show I&rsquo;m serious, and to prevent the &ldquo;buyer&rsquo;s remorse&rdquo; brand of overthinking. As Katty Kay and Claire Shipman write in &ldquo;The Confidence Code,&rdquo; action separates the timid from the bold. Be bold.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Set a timer. </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can do this both for the action &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give myself 15 minutes to compose and send this email&rdquo; &mdash; and for overthinking itself &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let myself worry for the next 10 minutes, but then I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo; Sounds silly, but it works surprisingly well.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Dwell on success. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Conjure up a list, ideally on paper, of decisions you&rsquo;ve made in the past that turned out well. Then, if you need to dwell, do so there rather than on the negatives and worries.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Practice improv. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve ever attended improvisational theater, you know that those performers are masters at not overthinking. What can you learn from them and adopt into your own processes? My personal favorite? The &ldquo;Yes, and &hellip; &rdquo; principle. Google it or read an improv actor&rsquo;s memoir. There are several terrific ones in bookstores right now.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Imagine all possible outcomes. </strong></h3><p> <br/> What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen &ndash; and could you live with that? What&rsquo;s the best that could happen &ndash; and how much do you want that? What will this action or decision mean to you next week, next month, five years from now?</p><p> Earlier, I referred to myself as a former overthinker, and most days that&rsquo;s true.

The current strength of the dollar has certainly been great for US tourists, as well as US-based companies who source goods overseas. But it hasn&rsquo;t been such a windfall for international companies or their investors. As an advisor, that can present a tough challenge. Your clients need the international exposure, but the strong dollar limits the opportunity for return. The media isn&rsquo;t helping either, making your clients wary about non-US investments. With China&rsquo;s economic woes just the tip of the iceberg, it&rsquo;s no wonder international stocks been out of favor for years.</p><p> Despite the obstacles, international stocks are a vital part of a strong, diversified portfolio. But how do you persuade your clients to take the leap? And even if they do, what&rsquo;s the best way to go about adding non-US assets to a portfolio when you&rsquo;re working with smaller clients for whom mutual funds aren&rsquo;t the best option?</p><p> One approach that has been delivering positive results for more than a decade is to leverage the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; in smart beta&mdash;focusing on momentum and trend&mdash;while adding ADRs to the mix to include international stocks with lower transaction fees. The benefits are twofold. First, not only does smart beta offer your clients an alternative to passive index investing, but because it focuses on momentum and trends, it&rsquo;s a powerful approach that &ldquo;lets the winners run&rdquo; while weeding out stocks that are losing momentum or beginning their downward descent. This helps minimize the increased risk that many investors have learned to associate with non-US markets. Second, leveraging ADRs not only opens the door to foreign stocks by eliminating international transaction fees, but because they&rsquo;re denominated in US dollars, they actually increase in value as the strength of the dollar wanes.</p><p> But the dollar is strong&hellip;right? At the moment, yes. But just as it&rsquo;s wise to look at momentum and trends in stocks, taking a close look at how the dollar is trending is important as well. This past January, the dollar index hit its highest point in a decade. It&rsquo;s precisely why you got online and booked that trip to Italy. But the tide appears to be turning. Last week the dollar index fell to its weakest level since January 2015, and indicators are pointing to potential continued weakness. Historically, a falling US dollar tends to have a negative impact on domestic returns and a positive impact on non-US returns.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dollar.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to see that if this downward trend continues, now is an ideal time to invest in the &ldquo;winners&rdquo; overseas. It may not be ideal when you&rsquo;re paying your tab for dinner in Rome, but it may be just the environment you&rsquo;re looking for in your client&rsquo;s portfolio.</p><p> The great news is that this approach isn&rsquo;t limited to institutional and other larger investors. By utilizing ADRs, it opens the door to smaller retail accounts that would otherwise be restricted to mutual funds or domestic momentum portfolios. Plus, as long as the product is backed by a strong, disciplined momentum methodology, it can effectively cut out the losers&mdash;those international stocks that are trending downward&mdash; while building on the strength of the winners that are trending upward or continuing their strong momentum. Whether the dollar trends up or down in the coming months, this approach is a valuable alternative. It offers your clients international exposure without some of the increase in risk that can send their emotions reeling or, even worse, dissuade them completely from taking on international exposure.</p><p> <i>  To learn more about Smart Beta ETFs and the Dorsey Wright Relative Strength strategies, download the whitepaper </i> <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/Point_Figure?source=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <i>   Point &amp; Figure Relative Strength Signals  </i> </a> <i>  or contact </i> <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/GIG_ContactUs?source=OtherWebsite&amp;sd=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <i>   Dorsey Wright  </i> </a> <i>  .

{"original_id":5173,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Facts About Annuities Before You Invest a Single Dollar","link":"the-facts-about-annuities-before-you-invest-a-single-dollar","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on the market lately, you know that volatility has continued. The uncertainty has created a perfect opportunity for salespeople to come knocking with an answer to the fear of losing money.</p><p> Fixed annuities can be very attractive to investors. They&rsquo;re simple and pay 3% at most. That kind of annuity is a financial product designed to accept and grow the principal, and then provide scheduled payments to the individual for the rest of the person&rsquo;s life. Fixed annuities are designed to deliver reliable income without the risk of outliving your money. But this is not the type of annuity Kathy is referring to.</p><p> I received this email from Kathy last week:</p><p> \"I've been hearing about variable annuities that go up with the stock market, and when stock market drops it doesn't. It just stays the same. I think they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;indexed annuities.&rdquo; If this is the case why doesn't everyone have these? There has to be a catch. Can you explain so I can understand? Why are they pushing these so much? What do the sales people get for selling them?\"</p><p> Luckily, Kathy is wise enough to know that when something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Yet salespeople are very skilled at making a complex product sound very simple. In reality, these products are written with complexityto disguise the truth. Here&rsquo;s an example: A salesperson calls you offering an annuity that provides a &ldquo;guaranteed retirement income&rdquo; of 5% a year. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You invest $100K, and it&rsquo;s guaranteed to grow at 4 or 5%.&rdquo; But what the annuity really provides isn&rsquo;t nearly so simple.</p><p> If the market tanks 25% and you cash in the annuity, you would receive only $75K of your $100K. That&rsquo;s not much of a guarantee. On the flip side, if you agree to accept &ldquo;income&rdquo; for the rest of your life, you&rsquo;ll be allowed to withdraw up to 5% a year on the full &ldquo;value&rdquo; of your account, which is now $127,628. That means your original $100K investment will provide 5% a year in income, or $6,381 ($531.75 a month). At that rate, it will take about 16 years to recoup just your principal amount of $100,000. Assuming you took out the annuity at age 60, by the time you&rsquo;re 76 you will basically break even. You may have avoided some market risk, but considering that the market grows at an average rate of 6-7%, someone is making money off your investment&mdash;and it certainly isn&rsquo;t you.</p><p> But the annuity &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; 5% growth, right? Here&rsquo;s where the complexity (and the lack of clarity when speaking to most salespeople) comes in. Most annuities with guarantees are talking not about &ldquo;cash guarantees&rdquo; but &ldquo;income guarantees.&rdquo; And while you and I may assume &ldquo;income&rdquo; means what we&rsquo;ve earned on an investment, in this case it refers only to what you can withdraw, or your &ldquo;retirement income&rdquo; before they die. In many cases, investors won&rsquo;t even withdraw the full value of their principal investment. What&rsquo;s that mean? You may as well have put the $100K under your mattress&mdash;NOT a strategy I recommend!!</p><p> Here are some other downsides of variable annuities: </p><li> Annuities lack flexibility. My clients want access to what they need when they need it. If you need to withdraw more than 5% from an annuity, you jeopardize the &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; and pay other surrender penalties. In other words, you&rsquo;re stuck at 5%, regardless of your needs.</li><li> You will pay more for spousal benefits. Withan IRA or other traditional investment account, your beneficiary receives the remaining funds after you&rsquo;re gone. If you want your spouse to receive benefits from your annuity, you&rsquo;ll probably have to take a discount on the withdrawal amount while you&rsquo;re living. Otherwise, the insurance company would have to absorb the increased cost of insuring two life expectancies.</li><li> The devil is in the details. As with any investment, excess fees can limit growth and cut returns down the line. These include annual fees and administrative charges, surrender penalties, the scope of the downside risk, and more. As I told Kathy, &ldquo;If it sounds too good to be true &hellip;&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> So why are salespeople so anxious to sell you an annuity? It&rsquo;s not your retirement they&rsquo;re thinking about&mdash;it&rsquo;s theirs. (For more on this hot topic, see my blog, For your nest egg, &ldquo;free&rdquo; advice can be costly.) Sales people usually get a 6-8% commission up front on the amount you put in. So while there&rsquo;s a big incentive for them to make a sale, there simply is no such thing as a guaranteed 5% annual return annuity. (Any company that offered such a product would be out of business before you could collect on the promise!) If you&rsquo;re not 100% certain you understand a product&mdash;including what exactly is guaranteed and what you can realistically expect as a return on your investment&mdash;get answers to your questions from an objective third party before buying.  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-12 15:34:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-12 15:34:11.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_f0fPGK8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-facts-about-annuities-before-you-invest-a-single-dollar/\", \"post_id\": \"11014\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-12 15:34:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-12 15:34:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-facts-about-annuities-before-you-invest-a-single-dollar\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11013\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5387\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Facts-About-Annuities-Before-You-Invest-a-Single-Dollar.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1248\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463148000,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}

Those with leased cars can cancel the lease. &lsquo;Substantial compensation&rsquo; on top of the buyback or fix will also be awarded to consumers.&rdquo; (9)</p><p> **April 22, 2016: Volkswagen released information that they have more than doubled their reserves to handle this crisis to $18.2 billion (USD).</p><h3> Scope of the Scandal <br/>  </h3><p> Rather than select an external CEO to assume leadership of numerous tasks related to Dieselgate, the board selected an insider, Matthias M&uuml;eller. Regardless, the tasks are huge and complex. (8)</p><p> <strong>  Overarching </strong></p><p> &bull; Determining who&rsquo;s ultimately responsible &ndash; taking appropriate actions <br/> &bull; Demonstrating strong leadership &ndash; direct, clear, immersed</p><p> <strong>  Regulatory, Government, Legal </strong></p><p> &bull; Keeping prosecutors from filing criminal charges <br/> &bull; Meeting information demands of regulators globally <br/> &bull; Holding down penalties and legal damage</p><p> <strong>  Internal </strong></p><p> &bull; Creating a new top-management team <br/> &bull; Confronting internal culture damage</p><p> <strong>  Stakeholders </strong></p><p> &bull; Maintaining calm among restless, powerful labor interests <br/> &bull; Providing information to stabilize stock prices</p><p> <strong>  Brand, Consumers, Dealers </strong></p><p> &bull; Addressing damage to global sales and brand equity <br/> &bull; Deciding how to compensate owners of cars with the software <br/> &bull; Developing a new U.S. market strategy <br/> &bull; Retaining U.S. dealers who are beyond frustrated</p><p> Mr. M&uuml;eller clearly needs to prioritize and focus to attack this monumental list of crucial issues.</p><h3> Brand Implications <br/>  </h3><p> VW dug a deep hole where consumer confidence and brand equity are concerned. VW touted its &ldquo;Green&rdquo; virtues &ndash; with diesel as a selling point. They were bold enough to run a commercial during the Super Bowl showing their engineers sprouting angel wings! (7)</p><p> That arrogance increases difficulty in regaining trust from consumers and dealers. (5)</p><p> In Harris Poll&rsquo;s (1) most recent &ldquo;Corporate Reputation&rdquo; rankings for the 100 most visible companies in the U.S. Honda Motors ranked #17, the highest among automotive brand. Volkswagen Group dropped to the very bottom of the list &ndash; the only company to receive a &ldquo;very poor&rdquo; rating.</p><p> Still, many are counting VW as &lsquo;down, but not out&rsquo;, pointing to other brand disasters where over time the company was able to rebuild the brand. However, doing so will require understanding what will resonate with consumers and creating a brand strategy with consistent messaging that&rsquo;s spot-on. Regaining trust from consumers and dealers will not be a walk in the park. (5)</p><h3> Looking Forward <br/>  </h3><p> Consumers historically have forgiven brands depending on how they work to regain trust. But, prepare for the long haul. Banks are still recovering from the financial crisis.</p><p> 1. Make necessary changes to leadership, culture&hellip;the list is long. <br/> <br/> 2. Demonstrate remorse and emphasize a commitment to &lsquo;making things right&rsquo; &ndash; repeatedly. <br/> <br/> 3. Begin delivering on the brand promise &ndash; without fanfare. Ensure consistency in delivering what is promised.</p><h3> Action Items: <br/>  </h3><p> 1. While the grand scale of the intentional deception on VW&rsquo;s part may be way beyond anything that could happen in your company, ensure there are no situations where you and your leadership team aren&rsquo;t fully aware of actions taken, and no one on your leadership team is giving direction that doesn&rsquo;t meet overall company strategic objectives. <br/> <br/> 2. Review external brand messaging from your organization. Is it well targeted to your selected audience(s)? Direct, accurate, confident &ndash; without arrogance? <br/> <br/> 3. Review your internal &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo; plan. While a crisis of this sort isn&rsquo;t likely, it&rsquo;s critical to be ready for any crisis. The expectation of leadership and control from the very beginning is now the norm.</p><p> 4. Assess your company&rsquo;s relationships with third parties to ensure your organization&rsquo;s reputation is strong and consistent.</p>Sources:<br/>1.

Make Sure You Tick off This 12-Point Checklist","link":"writing-a-blog-post-make-sure-you-tick-off-this-12-point-checklist","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Anyone can write a blog post.</p><p> Writing a winning blog post &mdash; one that captures attention, draws readers in past the first few lines, keeps them engaged to the end, and sees them follow through on your call-to-action &mdash; that&rsquo;s a little more difficult.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve taken the guess work out of writing a winning blog post. Use this 12-point blog post checklist and win every time.</p><h3> 1) A headline that captures attention</h3><p> <br/> According to Brian Clarke from Copyblogger, 8 out of 10 people on average will read the headline copy of your post, but only 2 out of 10 will read the rest.</p><p> So if writing headlines is so important, what&rsquo;s the best way to write them? The quick answer: STEAL.</p><p> Really smart people have mapped out the path to consistently great headlines, and they call them &ldquo;headline formulas.&rdquo; These proven formulas can be found all over the internet, and they&rsquo;re begging you to steal them.</p><p> Here are a few to get you started:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/10-sure-fire-headline-formulas-that-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   10 Sure-Fire Headline Formulas That Work  </a> </u>  from CopyBlogger</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.crazyegg.com/2011/12/26/proven-headline-formulas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Steal These 15 Proven Headline Formulas For Your Next Landing Page Or Blog Post  </a> </u>  from CrazyEgg</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-blog-headlines#sm.000015yvns2279f93xuvfux5lmt30\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   13 Types of Blog Headlines That Will Get You More Traffic  </a> </u>  from HubSpot <br/>  </li><p> If these frameworks aren&rsquo;t enough,  <a href=\"http://blog.videofruit.com/questions/come-up-headlines-for-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  check out this tactic </a>  from Bryan Harris at Videofruit. It&rsquo;s a technique that allows you to piggyback off the most popular headlines from sites like BuzzFeed &amp; Huffington Post.</p><h3> 2) A short first paragraph that holds the reader&rsquo;s attention</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not enough to get your reader past the headline: you have to hook them into reading the good stuff.</p><p> Ask a question, share an interesting fact, set up the problem that your audience is facing and how you will solve it.</p><p> Your first paragraph is a gateway, so usher your reader through it.</p><p> Need to see this in action? Check out these posts for inspiration:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/celebrity-rebranding-jordin-sparks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How Celebrities Market Themselves: Inside Jordin Sparks&rsquo; Rebranding Campaign  </a> </u>  by HubSpot</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://copyhackers.com/2015/03/write-an-about-page/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Do These 7 Tragic Mistakes on Your &lsquo;About&rsquo; Page Chase Customers Away?  </a> </u> by Copy Hackers</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/creative-content-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A Simple Content Marketing Strategy for Creative Folks  </a> </u>  by CopyBlogger <br/>  </li><h3> 3) 3 sentences or less in each paragraph</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s face it &mdash; most of us don&rsquo;t have big attention spans.</p><p> Writing shorter paragraphs will help break up your content and make it easier to digest for your readers. Three sentences is a good ceiling.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/the-rise-of-mobile-infographic1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Trinity Digital Marketing </a>  reports that over 1.2 billion people access the web from their mobile devices.</p><p> Longer paragraphs, especially when viewed on a mobile device, make the post look bulkier. People won&rsquo;t want to read them.</p><p> Shorter, properly spaced paragraphs might have the exact same amount of words, but they look much easier to read.</p><h3> 4) 1-3 images throughout the post (but not too many stock images)</h3><p> <br/> Images break up your content, explain your point, and keep your readers engaged.</p><p> 1-3 images throughout your post will make a huge difference. But make sure you don&rsquo;t use too many stock images&mdash;it makes you look lazy, and it makes your blog look impersonal.</p><p> There are a number of tools and sites you can use to create your own, unique images:</p><li> <a href=\"https://buffer.com/pablo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pablo by Buffer </a>  is a great tool to create beautiful images for your posts in under 30 seconds.</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Canva </a>  goes one step further and gives you full design capabilities online without expensive software or any graphic design skills.</li><li> <a href=\"http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/stock-up\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Stock Up </a>  allows you to search 21 high-quality, free stock photo websites in one place. You&rsquo;re sure to find an image you want and save time in the process. <br/>  </li><p> The best part?  Tools like Canva and Pablo allow you to create images that include your logo. Custom, branded images in under 10 minutes&mdash; who wouldn&rsquo;t want that?</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t have time to mess with a &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; tool,  <a href=\"http://www.kapa99.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  check out Kapa99 </a> . They offer 2 custom design jobs a day for $200/mo. It&rsquo;s an insanely good deal, and their work is phenomenal.</p><h3> 5) Data-backed statistic that links to a credible resource</h3><p> <br/> Think of this as a credibility builder for your own blog.</p><p> If you share data-backed (not just made up) statistics and link them to a credible resource, people will trust what you say more. Look back at point #1 &mdash; we shared a statistic from Copyblogger, one of the leading resources for content development.</p><p> Take this link away, and the section loses authority.</p><h3> 6) A specific keyword that the post is focused on</h3><p> <br/> Search engines love keywords, so take advantage. Tailor your blog posts around specific keywords, and they&rsquo;ll get more visibility.</p><p> <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\" target=\"_blank\">  Use Google Keyword Planner </a>  to figure out the keywords that will work for your niche. You can also use this tool to see the competition for each keyword. By checking out the competition, you can target keywords that you have legitimate shot at ranking for.</p><h3> 7) Links to other relevant pages on your website</h3><p> <br/> Think of each post as a gateway to more content on your site.</p><p> Including links to other relevant pages on your website not only gives readers more of what they&rsquo;re looking for, it keeps them on your site and builds your reputation asthe place to get the information they need.</p><h3> 8) Links to reputable industry resources</h3><p> <br/> Keeping readers on your site is great, but don&rsquo;t forget to also point your readers to helpful resources on other sites.</p><p> You won&rsquo;t be an expert on every aspect of your industry. But by sharing links to others who offer resources you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll still establish yourself as a trusted blog to follow.</p><p> And for websites, trust is the principal builder of reputation.</p><h3> 9) &ldquo;Click to Tweet&rdquo; links throughout the post to encourage sharing</h3><p> <br/> Make it easy for your readers to share your content by including simple &ldquo;Click to Tweet&rdquo; links in the post.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s be honest&hellip;people are lazy (me included). I won&rsquo;t share someone&rsquo;s blog post unless:</p><p>      a) I think it&rsquo;s incredible</p><p>      AND</p><p>      b) it takes me less than 10 seconds to share it <br/>  </p><p> If you have a WordPress site, use the  <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/click-to-tweet-by-todaymade/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Click to Tweet plugin from Coschedule </a> . If you&rsquo;re not using WordPress, use the Basic Link feature from  <a href=\"http://clicktotweet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ClicktoTweet.com </a> .</p><h3> 10) Content Upgrades</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s hard to convince your readers to give you their email address, especially if the only thing you&rsquo;re offering them is &ldquo;weekly updates&rdquo; of your blog posts.</p><p> But when you offer them a downloadable resource (content upgrade), and that resource is directly related to the article they&rsquo;re reading&hellip;your chances of converting that reader into an email subscriber skyrocket.</p><p> When done right, content upgrades can  <a href=\"http://www.bloggingwizard.com/wordpress-plugins-deliver-content-upgrades/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  increase your conversions by more than 529% </a> .</p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.videofruit.com/lead-magnet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Here&rsquo;s a phenomenal article </a>  from Bryan Harris that shares 11 types of content upgrades you could offer to your readers.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s the content upgrade for this post?

It helps the reader know what to do with the content they just consumed.</p><h3> 12) Share your content via social media</h3><p> <br/> You could nail the first 11 points, but if you fail to distribute your content, your post will fall short of it&rsquo;s full potential.</p><p> <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/content-promotion\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Here&rsquo;s an article from Buffer </a>  that shares 11 effective content distribution strategies.

{"original_id":5177,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Do We Love Men and Financial Advisors That Do Not Love Us Back?","link":"why-do-we-love-men-and-financial-advisors-that-do-not-love-us-back","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Far too many women stay in bad relationships with men that do not deserve them. Plenty of women stay with investment professionals who do not deserve their business either. We let them treat us poorly, not returning emails and calls. We look for support and real understanding when there is none to be found. We place our happiness in the hands of someone who we know, deep down, does not care. </p><h3> It turns out that the same reasons we stay with the wrong guy are the same reasons we remain with the wrong financial advisor. </h3><p> <br/> Bad man and bad financial advisor decisions result from lack of self-worth. We women stay because we are not confident enough in ourselves to leave. Before you look away and judge me, please hear my story.</p><p> I am brilliant at loving men who do not love me back. Many years ago my father revealed all of my dating missteps at a very hard-to-forget family function. When my father had the microphone, he reminded the 50 guests and me that the Mohawk guy, blue haired guy, shaved head guy and 30 years-older than me guy were most likely not an ideal fit for his little girl. Even though Dad was sober, most of the guests were not, thank goodness. </p><p> Was this friends and family gathering one of the most embarrassing moments of my life? Definitely! Was it a good thing? Well, yes. Sometimes you have to be hit on the head to learn a lesson. This is true with relationships - both the love kind and financial advisor sort. </p><p> For many reasons, I did not feel worthy of being with an incredible man. I did not love myself and could not imagine that a nice guy would ever care for me either. I let myself settle for second best. Ok, to be honest, it was more like third best. I put up with all the bad behavior that you see on popular reality TV shows. Think The Bachelor show, and my guy is dating many women at the same time. Unfortunately, no one let me know about the others until the rose ceremony. Another show I relate to is The Kardashians. These narcissistic men have nothing on the great ones I found. No sex changes in my past, though. </p><p> When it came to my investment advisor, I also stayed because I did not feel confident enough to go. He tried to sell me products like life insurance that I did not need and high-commission investments. This advisor made me feel stupid when I asked questions. I felt like I needed to stay with him because deep down I feared that I would never get smart about finances.</p><p> Finally, having had enough of my dismal love and money life, I decided to take control by learning to love myself. I found this self-love nirvana by putting myself first which is a must when dating your mate and working with your advisor.  </p><p> I decided to sign up for the NYC Marathon, despite the fact that I cannot even run to the end of my block without huffing and puffing uncontrollably.</p><p> My first day out running was pathetic. I managed to &ldquo;run\" about fifteen minutes. I was out of breath, purple in the face and humiliated by speedy NYC walkers passing me because my jog was more of a fast labored walk. One less than supportive passerby yelled, &ldquo;Lady, you call that running? My Grandma is faster than you!&rdquo; Most likely his granny was quicker.</p><p> I kept on running despite the awful start to my transformation journey. I ran 5 to 6 days a week. I strapped on running shoes in 100-degree heat, rain storms and even on early mornings when I was still suffering a hangover from the night before. Eventually, I could run faster and farther. Slowly, the unbearable agony of running was replaced by a more tolerable, ongoing, duller pain. My body and mind became stronger than before. My taste in the opposite sex also changed from men that could never love anyone except themselves to ones that treated me as well as I treated my new self. </p><p> Next, I enrolled in night classes to get savvy about money, investing and savings. As the finance classwork progressed, I developed my money muscles, too. Soon I was budgeting all my dollars spent, maxing out my 401k and putting money aside into an emergency fund. Reaching the Everest of financial self-appreciation, I even asked my boss for a raise to make sure I was earning what the men in my office were pocketing. I realized I was not money stupid and looked for an advisor that would treat me the way I deserved to be treated.</p><p> This journey started over 17 years ago, and I have come a long way. I am married to the man of my dreams, a proud mom of great kids (most of the time) as well as the owner of a cute dog and a very misbehaved cat. I continue to love myself first and do things that may seem selfish to others. I take the time to work out hard six days a week, funnel 20% of my income into savings instead of indulging my kids with every toy they ask for, and secretly look forward to business trips so I can order room service and watch mindless television. </p><h3> I also became a financial advisor. Approaching nearly 15 years at the helm of my own wealth planning firm, I feel like I have finally proven that I am super money savvy. </h3><p> <br/> What about you? Are you settling with your mate? Do you have an imperfect financial advisory relationship? If you are settling with one, you are most likely also compromising with the other. It is all about your worth. My biggest wish for you is that you do not have to reach your love and money rock bottom moment like I did to wake up and demand a better life for yourself. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-12 16:48:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-12 16:48:23.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_6V1D2us.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-do-we-love-men-and-financial-advisors-that-do-not-love-us-back/\", \"post_id\": \"11021\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-12 16:48:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-12 16:48:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-do-we-love-men-and-financial-advisors-that-do-not-love-us-back\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11019\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5391\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Writing-a-Blog-Post-Make-Sure-You-Tick-off-This-12-Point-Checklist.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"788\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463130000,"author_id":449,"chart_url":""}

Whether you are an entrepreneur, student, or a corporate leader it is important to develop and promote the brand &ldquo;You&rdquo;.</p><p> Your identity from a branding perspective is what comes to mind when others think of you; how they&rsquo;d describe you. The solid brand YOU helps people understand you, what are your values and characteristics, your experience and skills that differentiate you. It is what makes you, YOU.</p><h3> Social media by default is personal brand &ldquo;You&rdquo; online <br/>  </h3><p> Each comment you make on the social media, every tweet you send, every picture you post and every conversation you hold, contributes to your personal brand. Remember you are creating digital footprint consciously or unconsciously in your daily actions. So be purposeful in what you share as this digital footprint you leave, becomes your personal brand.</p><h3> Personal brand is an essential part of entrepreneurship. <br/>  </h3><p> Managing a brand is thus essential. Market yourself in such a way that other professionals and investors think of you first when there is a new business opportunity or project.  Be proactive and cultivate your brand as this is essentially your reputation.</p><h3> As Micheal Simmons writes &ldquo;Authenticity is key in the digital age.&rdquo;  <br/>  </h3><p> Discover yourself first and express authentically who you are. Your brand is the real you. It is the very essence that you embody. It should convey your real story. To start with, focus within a niche. Engage with other people who are interested in the same things as you. Demonstrate your potential and stay relevant. Find ways to produce value to your audience. Create yourself from inside-out and stand out in the crowd. Let your personality shine through the various social media platforms.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t yet created your brand, it&rsquo;s time to use personal branding to position yourself from the rest of the crowd.  </p><p> \"A strong personal brand is a mix of reputation, trust, attention, and execution.\" &ndash; Chris Brogan.</p><p> Reinvent yourself, have a clear story and build a strong and consistent brand.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-12 16:49:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-12 16:49:03.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_i1xAl7F.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-creating-a-personal-brand-matters-and-how-to-do-it-best/\", \"post_id\": \"11023\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-12 16:49:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-12 16:49:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-creating-a-personal-brand-matters-and-how-to-do-it-best\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11022\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5392\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-Creating-a-Personal-Brand-Matters-and-How-to-Do-It-Best.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"820\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463166000,"author_id":472,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5179,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Correlating Money to Happiness: How to Best Maximize Your Budgeting and Spending","link":"correlating-money-to-happiness-how-to-best-maximize-your-budgeting-and-spending","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What do you spend your money on?</p><p> I, personally, spend my money on books, Netflix and technology. Unfortunately, the books I buy sit on my shelf collecting dust, my Netflix account has a wide array of recommended television shows I don&rsquo;t have the time to watch and the technology I buy has to be replaced every couple years because new, updated products come out.</p><p> We all spend money on different things. Obviously there are the constants in society: taxes, housing and healthcare, but what about the other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;? Jewelry sales increased for 25 months straight, and smartphones purchases have been growing for years.</p><p> So the question I pose to you is this: Why do we spend money on all of this miscellaneous &ldquo;stuff?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s because we think these objects will make us happy. The new iPhone will have a better camera, which will make our selfies better, and that will make us happy. The new BMW will have a better radio, which will make us happy. We associate materialistic goods with happiness, but science has proven that is not actually the case.</p><p> Research has found that spending money on experiences makes us happier than buying &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo; This is because when we anticipate a trip we&rsquo;ve planned we have the excitement that increases with each day leading up to it. When we want &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; we experience only impatience until we can actually buy and use it.</p><h3> <strong>  Experiences, Not &lsquo;Stuff&rsquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is why I spent 2015 spending my hard-earned money on experiences instead of &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo; Now, obviously I can&rsquo;t go a year without spending money on necessary things, like food and drinks, but I exercised my growing self-control when it came to things like clothing and books. By doing this, I realized two things:</p><p> -First, this &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; is not going to be a budget buster for most people. These materialistic goods add up to about $2,000, which isn&rsquo;t an obscene amount of money.</p><p> -Second, spending money on experiences for myself and for the people I care about makes me exponentially happier than spending it on material goods for myself. Not that spending money on ourselves will make us less happy; it just won&rsquo;t make us happier. For instance, spending money on a necklace for my mother&rsquo;s birthday was a much better purchase than spending money on a new shirt when I have plenty of shirts in my closet already.</p><p> Granted, I didn&rsquo;t fully succeed with resisting material goods all year. I ended buying new air filters for my HVAC system, a replacement battery for my headset and paper and ink for my printer. But there were expenses I thought I would need, but surprisingly didn&rsquo;t. Like shampoo. I managed to survive on one tub of shampoo all year, without being dirty.</p><h3> <strong>  Correlating Money to Happiness </strong></h3><p> <br/> Spending money on others and buying experiences are just two of the five key principles that lie in money correlating to happiness. The other three include: limiting access to our favorite things, which allows us to appreciate them more; focusing on time over money, therefore yielding wiser spending; and delaying our consumption of purchased goods, which leads to increased enjoyment when we do use it.</p><p> Now, when I say spend money on experiences, I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that I recommend spending $400 a night on a deluxe suite hotel room. I encourage you to instead do something you&rsquo;ve never done but have always dreamed of, like parasailing or visiting Windsor Castle in England. The experiences will outweigh the hotel room forever, and the memories you create will (at the risk of sounding clich&eacute;) be priceless.</p><p> I concede that this system isn&rsquo;t a perfect fit for everyone. However, if everyone took the opportunity, even if just for a month instead of a year, I strongly believe that they will come to see just how little the purchases that are at the center of their budget actually mean in the long run.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-12 17:04:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-12 17:04:32.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_WT3D5UI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/correlating-money-to-happiness-how-to-best-maximize-your-budgeting-and-spending/\", \"post_id\": \"11025\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-12 17:04:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-12 17:04:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"correlating-money-to-happiness-how-to-best-maximize-your-budgeting-and-spending\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11024\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5393\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Correlating-Money-to-Happiness-How-to-Best-Maximize-Your-Budgeting-and-Spending.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"833\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463151600,"author_id":123,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5180,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Essential Stories Your Kids Need to Know to Build Their Self-Esteem","link":"5-essential-stories-your-kids-need-to-know-to-build-their-self-esteem","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Several weeks ago, I had a call with a man who has become inundated with too much information. &ldquo;I have boxes and boxes of memories,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My mom saved everything when I was growing up&mdash;tests from grade school, yearbooks, certificates, art projects, soccer trophies&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got it all.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;My wife says I should just throw it all away, but what if I get rid of something that&rsquo;s really important?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;future generations need the most important parts of you. You don&rsquo;t want your kids to have to dig through eighteen boxes of memorabilia to try to figure out what matters.&rdquo; Sure, we could take pictures of all his stuff and archive it, which is what I recommended. But in order for this man to have a purposeful legacy, he needs to highlight the essential pieces of his life that will most help his children and grandchildren.</p><p> In his book, The Secrets of Happy Families, Bruce Feiler writes about the &ldquo;Do You Know Scale.&rdquo; The Do You Know Scale is a list of twenty questions asked of children in over four dozen families in a study conducted by Dr. Duke and Dr. Fivush at Emory University. What they found is that children who have an idea about their family&rsquo;s past have higher levels of self-esteem, an internal locust of control, better family functioning, lower anxiety, fewer behavioral problems and better resiliency.</p><p> It&rsquo;s extremely important to document your roots to give you an anchor. Where did you come from? What are key family stories throughout the years? What is your family lineage? What are significant events that shaped your heritage?</p><p> There are ways to document and archive this information that is engaging for your family. Ongoing family milestones&mdash;such as births, marriages, and graduations&mdash; should also be documented to give a sense of time and place to future generations.</p><p> Doing this correctly can be a little tricky because you can become bogged down with too much inconsequential information like the man who called me. Does anyone care that he earned a B+ on one of his many spelling tests in fourth grade? It&rsquo;s similar to saving a newspaper from last year. When you look back at the stock market fluctuations, who cares Apple was down 1.45%?</p><h3> <strong>  Essential Stories Your Kids Need To Know </strong></h3><p> <br/> So, what should you pass on? Photos and mementos are fantastic &ndash; especially if you&rsquo;ve found the best ones and compiled them into a book or some sort of slideshow and then given those images further meaning by explaining who is in the photos, when they were taken, etc. But what&rsquo;s really going to enhance the lives of your children are stories that give them a foundation of self value. The following are the top five stories your children need to know in order to build their self-esteem. Your goal should always be to create a positive continuing dialog with your children and these stories will get the conversation started.</p><h3> Story 1: Life Before Them.</h3><p> <br/> Your children need to know how their parents met, what it was like for you as a child growing up and early memories you have about your childhood, teen years, what school you went to, etc.</p><h3> Story 2: Their History</h3><p> <br/> Your children need to know about each side of their family tree&mdash;their grandparents, great grandparents and anything you can tell them about where they came from. Why did you pick their name? What significance does it have? What was it like in the hospital when they were born?</p><h3> Story 3: The Tough Times</h3><p> <br/> Explain to your children about difficult times members of your family have gotten through. For example, how their great grandfather made it through the depression and started a business. Tell them about your personal struggles and how you persevered. This will give them a sense that they can preserver as well.</p><h3> Story 4: The Happy Times</h3><p> <br/> Tell your children about what makes you happy&mdash;your greatest loves, your passions, people you&rsquo;ve loved and goals you&rsquo;ve striven for and accomplished.</p><h3> Story 5: Lessons to Live By</h3><p> <br/> If you could only give your children 2 to 3 main principles to guide their lives, what would those be in short, concise statements? Now, think of a story to illustrate each principle and tell the story to reinforce it.</p><h3> <strong>  Storytelling Guidelines </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Make It Fun</h3><p> <br/> If you encounter above-average resistance (i.e. extreme eye rolling, whining or anger), don&rsquo;t force your stories on your family. Wait until the time is right. Otherwise, you run the risk of your family associating your stories with drudgery.</p><h3> Allow for Feedback</h3><p> <br/> The idea of telling your stories is to create open communication. If your kids have questions or would like to make comments, be open and accepting. Never make them feel like they&rsquo;ve said a dumb thing or shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to respond.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Act Like a Dictator</h3><p> <br/> Your kids will have their own ideas and want to develop into their own people. The idea of telling these stories is not to force your kids to follow your principles to the letter, but to give them a solid foundation upon which to base their growth. One hopes that if they are taught right and grow up in a home with parents of high character, they will follow those footsteps, but they must be trusted to act independently as they grow and mature.</p><h3> Questions from the &ldquo;Do You Know Scale&rdquo; study: <br/>  </h3><p> 1. Do you know how your parents met? <br/> 2. Do you know where your mother grew up? <br/> 3. Do you know where your father grew up? <br/> 4. Do you know where some of your grandparents grew up? <br/> 5. Do you know where some of your grandparents met? <br/> 6. Do you know where your parents were married? <br/> 7. Do you know what went on when you were being born? <br/> 8. Do you know the source of your name? <br/> 9. Do you know some things about what happened when your brothers or sisters were being born? <br/> 10. Do you know which person in your family you look most like? <br/> 11. Do you know which person in the family you act most like? <br/> 12. Do you know some illnesses and injuries your parents experienced when they were younger? <br/> 13. Do you know some of the lessons that your parents learned from good or bad experiences? <br/> 14. Do you know some things that happened to your mom or dad when they were in school? <br/> 15. Do you know the national background of your family (such as English, German, Russian, etc)? <br/> 16. Do you know some of the jobs that your parents had when they were young? <br/> 17. Do you know some awards that your parents received when they were young? <br/> 18. Do you know the names of the schools that your mom went to? <br/> 19. Do you know the names of the schools that your dad went to? <br/> 20.

Here's How to Make Them Feel More Comfortable with You","link":"clients-feeling-uneasy-heres-how-to-make-them-feel-more-comfortable-with-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> During a Q&amp;A at a recent speaking engagement, an audience member asked for suggestions about new, engaging ways to do portfolio reviews with a client.</p><p> He&rsquo;d had a particular client for more than a year and said the client always got very nervous during their review meetings. The advisor explained he&rsquo;d tried a different approach at each of their meetings, but it only seemed to make his client more uncomfortable and the situation worse. He said he just didn&rsquo;t know what to provide next.</p><p> I answered, &ldquo;Try providing some certainty. Not about the markets, or interest rates, or global economies&mdash;they can all change on a dime the very next day&mdash;but in regards to your process.&rdquo;</p><p> Most people don&rsquo;t like change, and uncertain change in relation to their finances is particularly uncomfortable. On the other hand, when people know what to expect, they feel more comfortable because they have a sense of control and familiarity.</p><p> When your meeting process follows a standard routine, your clients know what&rsquo;s coming, and they know what&rsquo;s, in effect, normal. </p><p> It&rsquo;s like when a cabin crew rolls through the pre-flight instructions regarding emergency procedures. You might think bringing up information about what to do if things go wrong would make people nervous, but passengers know this is a routine part of the process and even subconsciously welcome the feeling of security that routine gives. If those instructions were skipped, even people who seem completely disinterested when the cabin crew do their job would quickly become concerned because the routine they were expecting had changed.</p><p> When you conduct client reviews, you need to take the same approach as those in charge of passenger safety: consistently follow the same routine. When clients are familiar with your process&mdash;not faced with surprises or left guessing what&rsquo;s next&mdash;the more comfortable they will be with you, the one responsible for getting them to their destination safely.</p><h3> Conducting client reviews with the same method and approach every time allows you to: <br/>  </h3><li> Communicate confidence in what you do and how you do it, taking away your nervousness, which will only feed into any anxiety clients may have.</li><li> Make it harder for clients to leave you. People don&rsquo;t rush away from other people or circumstances they&rsquo;re comfortable with. By following the same routine each time, they feel more comfortable because they know what to expect from you.</li><li> Ensure you cover important information and issues that need to be discussed. Details don&rsquo;t accidentally get forgotten or neglected because you didn&rsquo;t have time to get to them.</li><li> Focus on listening to your clients&rsquo; concerns and questions so you can respond fully, rather than spending your emotional energy on producing a creative meeting. <br/>  </li><p> People usually don&rsquo;t want excitement, adventure, and thrills when it comes to discussing their finances. Instead of trying to think of new ways to impress your clients, simply provide them great, thoughtful, and consistent service time after time.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a rut, it&rsquo;s a reliable routine!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-12 17:16:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-12 17:16:31.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_14cwM0q.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/clients-feeling-uneasy-heres-how-to-make-them-feel-more-comfortable-with-you/\", \"post_id\": \"11029\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-12 17:16:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-12 17:16:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"clients-feeling-uneasy-heres-how-to-make-them-feel-more-comfortable-with-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11028\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5395\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clients-Feeling-Uneasy-Heres-How-to-Make-Them-Feel-More-Comfortable-with-You.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1515\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463216400,"author_id":378,"chart_url":""}

Value for them is something that they experience when you do your job in a way that resonates with them.</h3><p> <br/> We spoke with a woman who runs her own successful business focused on Millennials and helping organizations that want to attract them. She&rsquo;s a busy single mom with two rambunctious kids but she understands the importance of saving.</p><p> She told us that her advisor is her friend. He spends time listening to the challenges of her business, her issues with daycare, raising capital for her business, saving with an uneven source of income and the frustration of running a house by herself. Many of the conversations she concedes do revolve around her life and what&rsquo;s happening, but they do have &ldquo;more formal&rdquo; meetings where he talks about her portfolio and how it&rsquo;s doing.</p><p> She went on to say that recently when she mentioned to him that her ex-husband has been diagnosed with cancer, it lead to a discussion of how the kids would be affected if something did happen to either or both of them.</p><p> The advisor didn&rsquo;t just leave it at that &ndash; and this is where the real &ldquo;above and beyond&rdquo; type of service comes in &ndash; the kind clients rave about.</p><p> After some investigation he came back with an idea for protecting the kids financially and personally, should something happen. She liked it so he proceeded to put in place some safeguards to bring her the peace of mind she was looking for. The fact that it involved insurance and working with her lawyer wasn&rsquo;t as important to her as the outcome she sought.</p><p> This advisor wasn&rsquo;t interested in showing off his &ldquo;smarts&rdquo;; he was interested in taking the time to be there for her and help out when and wherever he could. It is not only the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do.</p><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> It takes time and an interest in the client&rsquo;s life to nurture the type of relationship that makes a good advisor -- a great advisor.

{"original_id":5183,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Now That the 2016 Budget Is Out. What's a Financial Services Marketer to Do?","link":"now-that-the-2016-budget-is-out-whats-a-financial-services-marketer-to-do","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/danielle-stitt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Danielle Stitt </a></p><p> In short, respond to questions clients ask, not the questions you think they want to ask.</p><p> Major events, like a Federal Budget, offer a perfect opportunity for connecting with clients &ndash; by answering their questions and helping them solve their problems. This will help you develop your brand as an organisation that understands, and gives your senior team a chance to demonstrate thought leadership.</p><p> The first temptation is to go straight into content production mode. The smarter move is to spend some time researching and identifying what information needs your audience has and then work out how you can address them.</p><p> A good Budget wrap-up can be valuable, but by the same token, there are any number of good budget wrap-ups already written, so don&rsquo;t feel you need to re-invent the wheel. The big banks have articles and videos targeting different aspects of the Budget, as do the major accounting firms, and financial advice firm ksm group has produced an excellent overview. All of these reports describe the significant changes announced in the Budget, along with commentary and explanations from experts in the field.</p><p> The window for producing a simple wrap up is probably around a week. After that its marginal utility quickly diminishes.</p><p> In the next wave of content after the precis dissemination stage you will need to dive into the detail, specifically addressing the answer most readers are asking, &ldquo;What does it mean for me?&rdquo;</p><p> By offering help and advice about next steps, you are giving them what they want and increasing engagement with your content at the same time.  </p><h3> So how do you start?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Step One &ndash; Identify your area of expertise </strong></p><p> For most of us in financial services, we won&rsquo;t be answering clients&rsquo; questions about healthcare and education. At the same time, depending on your area of expertise, you may not be addressing every question about financial services either.</p><p> Decide where you can add most value and play to your strengths.</p><p> <strong>  Step Two &ndash; Identify what our clients want to know </strong></p><p> <br/> If you take a bit of time to identify what your clients are asking about, you will be able to write the content they actually want to read. We all know that there is no point writing the best content in the world, if it doesn&rsquo;t solve a problem, answer a question, or in some other way forge a link between you and your client.</p><h3> Listen &ndash; social listening identifies areas of interest as well as trending questions and topics</h3><p> <br/> Start by listening to what your target audience is actually saying on social media, as well as on other forums accessible online. For example, search &ldquo;Budget 2016&rdquo; on Facebook and look at the top sites (sometimes competitors&rsquo;, sometimes media&rsquo;s etc), and take note of what people are posting and commenting about.</p><p> Well-known commentators, like Ross Gittens, will often answer questions for listeners and the themes that emerge can identify areas of interest for your clients. For example, we produced a word cloud from the Q&amp;A session Ross Gittens held after the announcement of the Budget. It identifies the most commonly repeated words and therefore highlights what was top of mind in that session. You don&rsquo;t need to squint with one eye to see that &ldquo;budget&rdquo;, &ldquo;tax&rdquo; and &ldquo;super&rdquo; are big deals.</p><h3> Respond &ndash; develop content around the themes you&rsquo;ve identified</h3><p> <br/> Now you are ready to produce your content. Prioritise the themes you want to pursue and map them to your target audience&rsquo;s information journey. In other words, simple educational pieces work best at the initial discovery stage while how-to articles will help someone ready to implement change.</p><p> Think also about the format of your content. Is your audience looking for answers on social channels, so needs a quick infographic, or are they wanting the detail only a significant white paper can provide? And more importantly, how can you breakdown your content into multiple formats to ensure it is in the channel and format your different audiences need?</p><h3> Distribute &ndash; get your message out there</h3><p> <br/> We suggest hosting your hub content (which answers your clients&rsquo; questions) on your website in the first instance. Your website is like the library and should provide clients information when they go looking for it (or ideally when they find your website in search results).</p><p> The second step is to promote the message across all your channels &ndash; newsletters/ EDMs, through the brand&rsquo;s/ CEO&rsquo;s/ employees&rsquo; social networks, as part of participation in online communities, including groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as other online investment based communities, and also via Twitter. Shameless self-promotion here but we have a great playbook which explains everything about  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/content-distribution-financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content distribution in financial services </a> .</p><p> By taking the time to identify what&rsquo;s important and being useful, you will take a major step towards better engagement with the people who matter most to your business. Your clients.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-12 17:21:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-12 17:21:56.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_7YTLjJ4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/now-that-the-2016-budget-is-out-whats-a-financial-services-marketer-to-do/\", \"post_id\": \"11031\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-12 17:21:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-12 17:21:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"now-that-the-2016-budget-is-out-whats-a-financial-services-marketer-to-do\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11028\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5397\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clients-Feeling-Uneasy-Heres-How-to-Make-Them-Feel-More-Comfortable-with-You.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"470\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463144400,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5184,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Things to Bear in Mind When Planning to Broadcast Live Video Content","link":"4-things-to-bear-in-mind-when-planning-to-broadcast-live-video-content","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From entertainment to education, video is fast becoming the go-to marketing medium across the world, engaging multiple audiences across a variety of platforms. And the best place for sharing video content is of course YouTube&hellip;or is it?</p><p> With live streaming becoming the next big thing, video platforms such as Snapchat, Vimeo and Periscope have been competing for YouTube's video champion title; and earlier this year, Facebook entered the ring with its latest offering: Facebook Live.</p><p> Facebook users have been able to upload videos to their timelines for some time now; but these videos were from the day, week or even year before. They couldn't capture what was happening at that very moment.</p><p> With Facebook Live Video, however, users can share live, up-to-the-minute videos of what they're up to. And while many people will use this feature to live-stream their child or dog doing something cute, it has a lot of potential for B2Bs too.</p><p> Imagine you're at a trade show or hosting an event. With Facebook Live, you can showcase new products, share footage of inspirational guest speakers, or conduct live interviews with influential members of your field - all before anyone else. Sounds good, right?</p><p> Here are a few things to bear in mind when you're planning to broadcast live video content, as outlined by Business2Community:</p><h3> Choose your content carefully</h3><p> <br/> Not everything is going to work well as a live video, so don't shoot something just for the sake of it. There should be a purpose to the content and some background context as well - don't just wander around filming everything you see!</p><h3> Promote your broadcast</h3><p> <br/> It's no good broadcasting a live video if no-one knows that you're doing it.

It&rsquo;s a lateral move, but I think it presents a ton of potential opportunities if I play my cards right. Unfortunately, the job is in an area I don&rsquo;t have much experience in, I&rsquo;ll have a new boss and I&rsquo;ll be working with people I&rsquo;ve never met. What can I do to make sure I take advantage of the situation and get off to fast and positive start?</strong>First off, congratulations on your new job. I&rsquo;m a big believer that change presents the best opportunities for advancement. I talk about this subject at length in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601633203/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=brendanreid-20&amp;linkId=a4481711d91a4358cff45ce52c66e791\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Stealing the Corner Office</a>. Just by embracing this new career challenge you&rsquo;re already setting yourself up for long term success. And as much as I applaud your ambition, I also know a move like this carries with it a reasonable dose of stress and uncertainty. At least, it would for me. Whenever I face these types of new opportunities I&rsquo;m usually about 80% confident and excited and about 20% nervous and foreboding. The little voice in my head that speaks on behalf of the 20% asks questions like:<li> Will everyone be able to tell I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing?</li><li> What happens when I don&rsquo;t understand the new lingo everyone is using?</li><li> What will I do when I screw this all up and have to go back and start over?</li><li> Will my new boss regret her decision after our first meeting?</li><li> Is there anything I can do to make sure I nail this?</li>I tend to feel this apprehension whenever I&rsquo;m starting something new and big. A new job, a big project, a major presentation. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t have confidence in myself, its more about the unknown, and about making sure I do all the right things to get off to a solid start. And, while on the one hand, I&rsquo;d like to punch that little voice right in the nose, on the other hand, he reminds me to stay focused and put in a little extra effort to give myself the best chance of success. That little voice keeps me sharp, and to one extent or another, I probably owe him for a lot of the successes I&rsquo;ve had over the years.Whenever I&rsquo;m starting something new and unfamiliar or something that carries a degree of risk but a potentially high reward, I like to follow a standard game plan to build early momentum. Here are three steps I always take to dramatically improve my probability of success when taking on a big new thing. It doesn&rsquo;t guarantee victory &ndash; nothing will &ndash; but it certainly improves your odds.<h3> <strong>  1. Reduce your focus to one first deliverable </strong></h3>The biggest mistake I see people make when taking on a new role or a big project, is to allow themselves to be overwhelmed by the complexity of it all. Inevitably there are a million things you should be doing. Research, interviews, assessment, planning, ongoing work, daily problems &ndash; there are an unlimited number of things to deal with when you take on a new role or project. The mistake is to try and handle them all &ndash; even to pay attention to them all. What too many managers do is slowly wade through everything and slowly emerge out the other side after 6 months or a year once they&rsquo;ve figured it all out. This is a big mistake in my opinion. Months of research. Countless interviews with stakeholders. Pilot projects, tiger teams, steering committees. These are traps. They are corporate constructs created ostensibly to improve effectiveness but which in reality only serve to defer rapid progress.My recommendation when starting a new role or taking on a big project, is to focus on one thing only. A deliverable. It can be a plan. It can be a strategy. But its better if it&rsquo;s something that actually delivers value to the company. Fix one thing. Implement one thing. Get something done to build momentum and prove you can make things happen. Even if the thing you deliver is quite small, it&rsquo;s more important that you demonstrate an ability to execute something from start to finish than the size of whatever it is you deliver. Way too many managers take on a new role and find themselves still in the learning phase 6 months down the road. You&rsquo;ll hear them in meetings saying things like, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve only been here 6 months but &hellip;&rdquo; or they&rsquo;ll always talk about what they did at their last company with comments like, &ldquo;When I was at Apple we used to &hellip;&rdquo;. You should be trying to get out of that phase as quickly as possible.My advice for getting off to a quick start is to reduce your focus down to one specific deliverable within the first 90 days &ndash; 60 days is even better. And you should be willing to sacrifice other activities in order to deliver it. Don&rsquo;t spend your days researching or interviewing or auditing &hellip; just do something. Ignore the distractions that surround you and pick something to deliver. It&rsquo;s a critical first stake in the ground that tells your boss and others you&rsquo;re capable of delivering.<h3> <strong>  2. Build the &ldquo;artist&rsquo;s rendition&rdquo; of your desired end state </strong></h3>Another great way to get off to a fast start is to build the vision for what you want to achieve in a way that allows people to imagine what the future state will be when you&rsquo;ve had time to execute. It gives people some instant gratification even in a long term project scenario. This tactic always reminds me of the artist&rsquo;s rendition of a condo building that you see in the pre-construction phase of a development. You go into a showroom and you can see and touch exactly what your condo will look like before its even built. Model homes, brochures, drawings &ndash; all these things are designed to get you excited enough to invest &ndash; emotionally and financially &ndash; into something you won&rsquo;t actually get until well into the future.I use this strategy at work in much the same way. If I&rsquo;m taking on a new role or team or a project that will take many months or years to complete, I like to start by building out the artist&rsquo;s rendition of what the future will look like. It can take the shape of visual mock ups in the case of a big project like a web site or software application, it can be in the form of a metrics dashboard that shows what a new level of performance will be once you&rsquo;ve implemented a new process or it can be financial model that shows the impact of proposed strategy changes.My advice for getting off to a fast start and building momentum is to take the time to produce the artist&rsquo;s rendition of your long term goal. It&rsquo;s a great way to give your boss and other stakeholders something to get excited about today even when they won&rsquo;t actually get to enjoy it until much later.<h3> <strong>  3. Deliver a 3 phase plan to create alignment </strong></h3>Once you&rsquo;ve focused in on one thing to quickly demonstrate your ability to deliver, and you&rsquo;ve gotten everyone excited about the artist&rsquo;s rendition of your big idea or long term strategy, you now need to build a really compelling plan to execute it. This is where the three phase plan comes in handy. My general recommendation is to use a 30-60-90 day plan for this. It&rsquo;s a great way to align your boss and other key stakeholders to what you&rsquo;re going to deliver and more importantly, how you will collectively measure success. One of the great things about this type of plan is it doesn&rsquo;t require any specific domain or functional expertise to build. It&rsquo;s something you can deliver on whether or not you fully understand the nuances of the job yet. When I&rsquo;m feeling in over my head, I rely on this plan to demonstrate my value quickly while I try to figure everything out. I won&rsquo;t go into more detail on this here.Check out these blogs for more details and a free template:<li> <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/blog-1/2015/9/20/the-best-30-60-90-day-plan-and-how-to-use-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Best 30 60 90 Day Plan and How to Use It </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/blog-1/2016/2/8/7-little-known-uses-for-the-30-60-90-day-plan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Little Known Uses for the 30 60 90 Day Plan </a></li>In my experience, you should try to execute all three of these steps within the first 60 days at worst. I would shoot for the first 30 days if you can. If you&rsquo;ve only been in the new job or managing the new project for a month and you&rsquo;ve already delivered something tangible, given people a vision for the end state and aligned them to a three stage plan for success, you&rsquo;re off to a great start.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-12 17:27:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-12 17:27:57.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_fb0YuTc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-dramatically-improve-your-probability-of-success-when-taking-on-a-big-new-thing/\", \"post_id\": \"11035\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-12 17:27:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-12 17:27:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-dramatically-improve-your-probability-of-success-when-taking-on-a-big-new-thing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11034\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5399\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Dramatically-Improve-Your-Probability-of-Success-When-Taking-on-a-Big-New-Thing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"676\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463212800,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}

We either spend our time thinking about our past accomplishments or focus our attention on plotting our future moves. Although we may go through the motions of performing our daily tasks, our minds aren&rsquo;t centered in the present. The problem we face when we avoid throwing ourselves into our current situations is that we miss out on a great deal.</p><p> Are you ready to lead in the present?</p><p> Here are some strategies to make the present your priority:</p><h3> 1. Let go of the past</h3><p> <br/> Instead of beating ourselves up about the mistakes we have made in our past we need to replace that thinking with identifying what we learned from them. Maybe you made a presentation last month that wasn&rsquo;t received as well as you had hoped. You might have wished your choice of words were clearer or more descriptive. You didn&rsquo;t answer the questions asked of you in the way you had hoped. There is still confusion about your project and you are concerned you didn&rsquo;t influence the team to move in your direction. Rather than dwell on what went wrong with that past presentation:</p><li> Decide how you will now redo your project to be make it more understandable and relatable</li><li> Reach out to team members today for feedback and listen with an open mind</li><li> Use a fresh approach and a new design to reflect the changes</li><li> Be grateful you will have a second chance up at bat to woo the group <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Create an inspiring work environment</h3><p> <br/> To be successful in our present situations we need to cultivate a space where we feel motivated as well as free to be creative. Look around at your desk or work area and ask yourself if it is inviting. Do you have the necessary tools and information available? Are you feeling comfortable in your chair or working with the best equipment?</p><h3> 3. Develop strong relationships</h3><p> <br/> We know that we  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2016/04/24/four-reasons-leaders-depend-on-others/#sthash.hwshw2xO.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  depend on others </a>  to do our jobs well so forging  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2016/02/14/five-ways-to-add-heart-to-your-leadership/#sthash.8suVYNSt.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  meaningful connections  </a> with our co-workers and colleagues is key to leading in the present.</p><li> Invite someone to coffee or lunch today</li><li> Ask a team member about a challenge they are experiencing</li><li> Offer to help someone out on a project</li><li> Tell a buddy at work what a great job they did and how grateful you are to have them on your team <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Make a list of the positives of your job</h3><p> <br/> You say that you are happy with the status quo but what adds to that feeling? Step back and take a hard look at what is going well today. What brought a smile or a laugh to you this week at work? Are you able to use some new skill you mastered in your current project? How did it feel to finally have the opportunity to present in front of the boss and the team? Having a sense of adding value can help us lead more effectively in our present.</p> <h3> 5. Model leading in the present</h3><p> Once you embrace the importance of being in the present  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/06/08/four-ways-to-kick-into-leadership-hd/#sthash.4X106oNL.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  showing others  </a> how much they can miss out by not focusing on today can make a difference in their lives too.</p><li> Help team members celebrate today&rsquo;s victories</li><li> Point out how the mess up yesterday has no bearing on today if new strategies are employed now</li><li> Don&rsquo;t spend so much time planning for the future that the present passes everyone by</li><li> Be the leader that reminds people of the power of today <br/>  </li><p>  How do you lead in the present?

Good sales teams hit quota because they have the ability to close deals.  But great sales teams exceed quota because they engage, influence, and earn the buyer&rsquo;s trust. </h3><p> <br/> These questions hold the key to being great&hellip;</p><li> Why should every executive in your company be social selling?</li><li> What social media skills does your sales leadership need?</li><li> How do you know if your sales team needs  <a href=\"https://www.allaboutleveragellc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  social selling training </a> ? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Why should every executive in your company be social selling? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Social Selling starts at the top.  As a company executive, isn&rsquo;t is your duty and responsibility to build personalized relationships with your network of prospects, continue relationship development with your clients and centers-of-influence, and thought leadership to all interested parties? </p><p> As an executive, you are a resource for your specific subject-matter-expertise, whether that&rsquo;s internal or external.  You open dialogues every single day with your network.  It is your responsibility to do so.  You work hard at staying top of mind with your network so they can approach you when they are ready to purchase, or can refer you to someone that needs your assistance.</p><p> Social Media is not about sales.  Social Selling is not about sales either.  We are in a digitally enabled world where the social platforms we leverage allow us to engage in real-time conversations with interested parties all over the world or right in our back yards.  These social platforms also allow us to target specific people and companies, engage them in conversation, and provide resources to assist.  Social Selling is really about influencing.  Social Media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc., allow us to influence hundreds-thousands-millions of interested parties&hellip; or target specific locations, company sizes, even titles.  We have the ability to cast a wide fishing net or spear fish in a barrel.</p><p> As an executive you are a representative of your company&rsquo;s brand and culture.  Whether you are in sales or not, you are an executive.  It is imperative that you are where your prospects want to find you and that you are influencing their decisions through engagement.</p><h3> <strong>  What social media skills does your sales leadership need? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Communication through social media is a game changer.  Take a look at this infograph from  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/six-social-media-skills-every-leader-needs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  McKinsey&amp;Company </a> :</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/six-dimensions-of-social-media-literate-leadership.png\" width=\"633\"/> <br/>   <br/> As you can see, social media and social selling are equivalent to an 8,000 lb gorilla or the biggest onion you have ever peeled.  Each of the 6 segments can be analyzed even further and broken down to multiple layers, each new layer revealing yet another new layer beneath it, allowing your leadership to customize a social selling process that is targeted to build power networks, open more doors, and maximize client acquisition. </p><p> Most companies are currently leveraging social media and social selling best practices, but best practices will only get you so far.  If you want to develop and implement a successful social selling program within your organization, there needs to be a culture shift&hellip; perhaps even a leadership shift.  It starts from the top down and can trickle or snowball. Your sales leadership must be able to build momentum and continue to build on that momentum, both internally with your team, and externally with your prospects.</p><h3> <strong>  How do you know if your sales team needs social selling training? </strong></h3><p> <br/> It seems that the mentality in the sales environment is very focused on instant gratification.  Everything is &ldquo;Now! Now! Now!&rdquo;.  A culture shift and mentality shift is crucial to the success of implementing a successful social selling process.</p><p> Remember, social selling is about influencing the buyer &ndash; not closing the sale.  Your prospects want you to engage with them.  They want to be able to find youhowever they are most comfortable finding you&hellip; whether that is from a referral, or on LinkedIn, or Twitter, etc.  It&rsquo;s important to keep the spotlight facing out.  If you are waiting for your prospects to engage with you the way you want them to engage, you could be waiting for quite some time.  Turn the spotlight out. Focus on where they are.  Engage. Influence.</p><p> Are you running your LinkedIn numbers?  Is your team listening to the people that are interested in what you have to offer?  Are they engaging prospects in conversation on-line, building trust, and influencing their decision?  If you&rsquo;re answer is no or you&rsquo;re not sure, then I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that you need  <a href=\"https://www.allaboutleveragellc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  social selling training </a>  program for your team.</p><p> How do you run the numbers?  I think LinkedIn has become the most powerful research tool for sales people today.  LinkedIn provides in-depth information on companies, professionals, who&rsquo;s viewing your profile, who&rsquo;s engaging in your content, who knows who, etc.  Some are available with the free membership, but it&rsquo;s well worth a Premium membership for deeper insight and increased capabilities.  LinkedIn also provides the ability to seek out our specific decision makers through advanced and saved searches, searching within your 1st degree connections&rsquo; network, searching within groups, and Boolean logic.</p><p> The buying process has already changed to a digitally enabled, time-saving, targeted process.  Isn&rsquo;t time to shift your selling process influence/ top of mind/ engagement process to be there when your prospect is working through their buying process?  It is imperative that you exist where your prospects want to find you.  Your prospects want you to engage, inquire, recommend, and become a resource.  They want to trust you.  But they can&rsquo;t if they can&rsquo;t find you.</p><p> If there are not ready to commit right now, staying in front of them will help them decide on you when they are ready to commit.  There is no magic bullet.  You will gain from this what you put into it.  You need a process and it must start from the top down.  It&rsquo;s time to go from good to great.</p><p> Remember:</p><li> Be the first to give to your new business relationships</li><li> Always pay it forward</li><li> Network with purpose. <br/>  </li><p> Good luck and good networking!

{"original_id":5189,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Change Manager: Therapist, Babysitter, Cat Herder","link":"change-manager-therapist-babysitter-cat-herder","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The wealth management industry is undergoing a rapid change, with the most recent being the new DOL fiduciary rule positioned to transform the way the financial industry delivers investment advice.</h3><p> <br/> In a typical firm, people in charge of change management wear many hats ( <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/change-management-science-herding-cats/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  including cat herder </a> ). And it&rsquo;s not just the roles you might expect, such as project management and IT support. Other roles that change managers assume include therapist and babysitter, according to Dr. R. S. Jerome, speaking on change management at the recent Laserfiche Empower conference.</p><p> While many people hate change, even when it&rsquo;s an improvement, change is necessary to survival, Jerome said, quoting Charles Darwin: &ldquo;It is not the strongest nor the most intelligent of the species that survives&hellip;it is the most adaptable to change.&rdquo;</p><p> The first question everyone asks in a change management project is &ldquo;Why?,&rdquo; Jerome said. To help gain buy-in&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s from the executives who approve the project or the employees and others who participate in it&mdash;it&rsquo;s important for the answer to that question to be tied to a necessary business improvement, he said.</p><p> Moreover, in addition to making sure people understand the motivation to change, they need to understand why changes need to happen now, Jerome said. People explaining the change need to communicate the pressure or sense of urgency that is leading management to decide to make the change at this moment, he said.</p><p> Jerome also described the  <a href=\"http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/mainframe-world/managing-people-the-scarf-model-65668\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;SCARF&rdquo; model of motivating people </a> , which helps you plan interactions with other people to minimize threats and maximize rewards in each of five areas:</p><li> Status, which is about relative importance to others</li><li> Certainty, which concerns being able to predict the future</li><li> Autonomy, which provides people a sense of control over events</li><li> Relatedness, which is a sense of safety with others</li><li> Fairness, which is a perception of fair exchanges between people <br/>  </li><p> One of the most critical factors in implementing change is support from management, Jerome said. This can include resources, champions, role models, and guides. Communication in general is also critical to the success of a change management project, he added. In fact, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to communicate about a particular change too much. &ldquo;Share the plan,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Probably to the point of being obnoxious.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s also important to have a plan for how the change will be implemented, Jerome said. The plan provides a framework for gaining input and addressing concerns. Examples of items to include in such a plan might be:</p><li> Purpose of the project</li><li> Expected outcomes</li><li> Which people are expected to change</li><li> Specific answers to the questions they might have about the process</li><li> Staff or stakeholders who may be resistant to change</li><li> An easily understood reason for the change</li><li> Motivation for the people expected to change: What&rsquo;s in it for them?</li><li> Rewards and other positive reinforcement <br/>  </li><p> With the right plan in place, change management is&hellip;well, not exactly easy, but it becomes more like babysitting, Jerome said. That said, there&rsquo;s still plenty that can go wrong in a change management process, he warned to avoid the following:</p><li> Making the change an option rather than a requirement</li><li> Focusing only on the process</li><li> Conversely, focusing only on the results</li><li> Not involving those expected to change</li><li> No &ldquo;training the trainer&rdquo; or other internal  input</li><li> No change in reward systems</li><li> Uncommitted leadership</li><li> Wrong size&mdash;implementing something that&rsquo;s either too large or too limited for your organization</li><li> No follow-through to determine what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and what needs&mdash;yes, more change</li><h3> <br/> But no matter how careful you are, something will always go wrong, Jerome admitted.</h3><p> <br/> Overall, Jerome said, it&rsquo;s important to remember that change is a process, not a single activity. But while it&rsquo;s important to have a model to follow for change management to ensure that everyone has a chance to be involved in that process, it&rsquo;s a mistake to use some sort of cookie-cutter approach that isn&rsquo;t specific to your organization. Change is a process that is unique to your organizational culture, as well as to the division, unit, and even to the individual employees, Jerome said.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to think of yourself as a therapist when you&rsquo;re working on a change management project, Jerome said. Therapists can&rsquo;t say things like, &ldquo;Just get over it,&rdquo; he advised. Similarly, respecting the views and concerns of the people being affected by the change is critical to your project&rsquo;s success.</p><p> Maybe you could just whisper it to yourself.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-14 17:08:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-14 17:08:26.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_46EwmRI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/change-manager-therapist-babysitter-cat-herder/\", \"post_id\": \"11044\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-14 17:08:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-14 17:08:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"change-manager-therapist-babysitter-cat-herder\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11043\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5404\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Change-Manager-Therapist-Babysitter-Cat-Herder.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"978\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463425260,"author_id":480,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5190,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Plan a Completely Different Approach For \"Retirement\" — Purpose Instead of Busyness","link":"plan-a-completely-different-approach-for-retirement-purpose-instead-of-busyness","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Retirement. It&rsquo;s a concept that certainly means different things to different people. But is it time to change how we define it&mdash;completely?</h3><p> <br/> While I was away on my abolutely blissful vacation in Belize last week, I finally had time to dig intoMarc Freedman&rsquo;s book,  Encore: Finding Work that Matters in the Second Half of Life . It has me utterly inspired. It&rsquo;s no secret that I&rsquo;m passionate about retirement planning&mdash;and not simply from a financial perspective. I feel part of my personal mission is to help people of all ages discover how to be truly happy both pre- and post-&ldquo;retirement,&rdquo; however they choose to define it. But as I read the book, I found myself swimming in new ideas.</p><p> First, I realized that I am in an &ldquo;encore career,&rdquo; Freedman&rsquo;s term for a later-in-life career that has a greater purpose and serves a greater good. My path to becoming a financial advisor wasn&rsquo;t straightforward, but once I found my passion, I was able to apply the myriad skills I&rsquo;d learned in my prior career and in my life to help others. The result: I&rsquo;m fulfilled every day because my life has greater meaning and value.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not alone. In his book, Freedman shares his experiences watching others go through similar shifts. But it&rsquo;s not always easy, in part because of society&rsquo;s expectations of those of us in the second half of our lives. Think about it: Here is a person at the height of professional ability. A person who has accumulated a career&rsquo;s worth of knowledge and personal insight. And our culture suggests that now is the perfect time to bring that growth to a screeching halt and, in essence, dive into a second childhood. To reduce our activities to simple leisure as though we&rsquo;re no longer capable of achieving or providing any good in the world. So we substitute busy-ness for purpose. We focus on building a better golf game instead of building a better world. As a result, people who have been successful in their careers are often thrown sideways when facing a traditional retirement. It&rsquo;s no wonder!</p><h3> But what if we took a completely different approach to &ldquo;retirement&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> This is precisely what Freedman is trying to help foster. He founded  <a href=\"mailto:http://encore.org\">  Encore.org </a> , a non-profit organization with the mission of &ldquo;building a movement to tap the skills and experience of those in midlife and beyond to improve communities and the world.&rdquo; By engaging millions of people in later life as a vital source of talent to benefit society, he hopes to help create a better future for young people and future generations. If it sounds lofty, just take a look at some of the  <a href=\"/advisor/shopping-for-a-financial-adviser-why-you-must-investigate-their-history/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  personal stories </a>  on the site, and you&rsquo;ll soon see how very real it can be.</p><p> What Freedman found is that highly skilled individuals&mdash;attorneys, physicians, volunteers, business leaders, artists, teachers, and more&mdash;thrive by finding new ways to apply their expertise in new, meaningful ways. He even created the  <a href=\"mailto:http://purposeprize.encore.org\">  Purpose Prize </a>  to recognize and reward passionate change-makers in the second half of life who are tackling the world&rsquo;s most urgent problems though social entrepreneurship and innovation. The organization has awarded over $5 Million in prizes to people working in everything from early childhood education to eradicating homelessness.</p><p> As I read his ideas and stories, I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if our highly publicized &ldquo;retirementcrisis&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a crisis at all, but rather a major shift&mdash;and an incredible opportunity for change. What if every one of us was able to find an encore career that not only gave us greater personal purpose but also helped build a better world? How much change could we drive together? How much happier would our communities be when filled with older, wiser women and men doing good for others? How much stress would be diminished if these encore careers could support the financial needs of those who have been &ldquo;aged out&rdquo; of their earlier careers and are seeking something new?</p><p> Of course, as a financial advisor, I understand that this type of change takes money (see my blog on  creating a freedom fund  for more on that topic!). I was lucky when I transitioned into myencore career; I had a solid &ldquo;freedom fund&rdquo; on hand, so I was able to take the time to explore options, identify dreams, and discover my purpose. I was blessed to work with Stanlee Phelps, an amazing life and business coach who helped me find my path. Since becoming a financial advisor in 2003, my passion has never waned. After reading Freedman&rsquo;s book, I decided that now is the time to take it one step further. Before I made it home from Belize on Saturday, I signed up for a year-long course to become a Certified Financial Transitionist&trade; (CeFT&trade;), beginning in June. This training will give me even greater knowledge and skills to guide my clients through financial transitions, including managing the physiological, sociological, and psychological impacts of change.

{"original_id":5191,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Increasing Retirement Income Through the Power of Tax Deferral","link":"increasing-retirement-income-through-the-power-of-tax-deferral","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Matthew Grove and Professor Ira Weiss, Ph. D.</p><p> As the Baby Boomer generation ages, financial services companies have found their new reason for being. They have seized upon the image of a mass retirement wave in the U.S. to create an entire &ldquo;retirement income&rdquo; industry built on marketing income solutions to retiring boomers. They have been quite successful in this mission&mdash;if you pick up any financial periodical, you&rsquo;re likely to find a headline about retirement income.</p><p> Although there&rsquo;s no doubt that retirement income will play an important role in the years to come, the reality is that the median boomer is 51 years old&mdash; fourteen years away from the traditional retirement age. Because of this, the focus of Baby Boomers and the generations that follow would be better aimed at savings accumulation. After all, accumulation is truly the stepping stone to retirement income. The more assets one accumulates during working years, the more income one can generate during retirement.</p><h3> For many investors, tax deferral should play a significant role in the accumulation process.</h3><p> <br/> By deferring taxes, investors allow gains to compound at a higher rate, creating significantly higher accumulated values over time. These higher accumulated values translate into a more robust retirement income stream, allowing investors to generate more retirement income, over a longer period of time, with a greater possibility of leaving a legacy for their heirs.</p><p> Notwithstanding this fact, many advisors underestimate the potential impact of tax deferral on retirement savings. And, many are uncertain how to quantify the value of tax deferral. This uncertainty stems from the fact that it takes a certain number of years of accumulation for the benefit of tax deferral to be realized, and investors with short time horizons may be better off in a taxable account in some cases.</p><p> Our analysis suggests that typical mutual fund investors with a moderate risk profile are better off in a low-cost tax-deferred account, rather than a taxable account, if they accumulate for more than ten years before generating retirement income. Conservative investors are better off in a tax-deferred account after just four years of accumulation, and aggressive investors will do better after thirteen years. These results are fairly consistent across a range of assumptions about investor characteristics and behavior.</p><p> So, how can consumers and their advisors take advantage of tax deferral? For much of the middle class, 401(k)s and IRAs provide an excellent vehicle for tax-deferred growth. However, the relatively low contribution caps of these vehicles can hamper many higher-earning investors&rsquo; ability to save tax-deferred. As a result, many investors have accumulated significant retirement savings in taxable accounts, and would have better outcomes if these assets were shifted to a tax-deferred account.</p><h3> Variable annuities, which offer tax deferral with practically unlimited contribution limits, can help fill this savings gap.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  However, many advisors are suspicious of traditional variable annuities </strong> because their insurance costs are significant, averaging over 1.35% of assets annually. These extra costs undermine the basic premise of tax deferral&mdash;that assets will accumulate more quickly because returns are compounding at a higher rate&mdash;by reducing the compounding rate through the burden of higher investment costs. In fact, our analysis shows that retirement investors with a moderate risk profile would require 31 years of accumulation in a traditional variable annuity in order to do better than a taxable account&mdash;far higher than the ten years of accumulation required for a low-cost tax deferred account.</p><p> However, new developments in the market&mdash;most notably the recent introduction of flat insurance fee variable annuities (&ldquo;flat fee VAs&rdquo;), which cost a flat fee of $240 per year, regardless of the amount invested&mdash;reduce the costs of investing in a variable annuity to negligible levels. Today, using this new class of variable annuity, retirement investors have almost unlimited access to low-cost tax deferral and can therefore choose to locate their entire retirement portfolios in a low-cost tax-deferred account.</p><p> The conclusions we draw from our analysis are twofold. First, advisors should consider moving some taxable accounts earmarked for long-term accumulation into a flat fee VA, as their clients&rsquo; after-tax outcome may be better. Second, advisors should review their clients&rsquo; existing VAs to determine whether they meet client needs. If a client has a VA because they are looking for incremental growth via tax deferral, their current VA might not be accomplishing that goal. In such cases, advisors should consider making a tax-free 1035 exchange into a flat fee VA. Of course, the current annuity should be reviewed for any loss of benefits or surrender charges that may be incurred.</p><p> To read the full, in-depth report, please visit us at Jefferson National <a href=\"https://www.jeffnat.com/knowledge-bank/whitepapers/increasing-retirement-income-through-the-power-of-tax-deferral/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-14 18:35:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-14 18:35:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_JPrT50B.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/increasing-retirement-income-through-the-power-of-tax-deferral/\", \"post_id\": \"11048\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-14 18:35:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-14 18:35:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"increasing-retirement-income-through-the-power-of-tax-deferral\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11047\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5407\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Increasing-Retirement-Income-Through-the-Power-of-Tax-Deferral.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"729\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463418060,"author_id":298,"chart_url":""}

All these are good guesses &ndash; they are all closing questions and these are arguably the most important things to say, but the number one most important thing to say is&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  Nothing.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s right, remaining silent after asking a qualifying question or using a tie down or a trial close, or &ndash; and this is especially difficult for most sales reps &ndash; when the prospect gives an objection (because a prospect will often explain his or her reasoning), and so remaining silent at these moments actually is your most powerful tool. </p><p> The reason for this is that your prospect or customer has all the answers as to why they&rsquo;ll buy or not buy, as to what you need to say to steer them towards the close, and to what objections or obstacles you need to overcome &ndash; and how to overcome them.</p><p> The problem for 90%+ of sales people is that they want to talk instead of suffer through what they interpret as an uncomfortable silence.  But it is just this silence that will always encourage your prospect to reveal more, and the more they reveal the more insight and leverage you&rsquo;ll have to close the sale.</p><p> So how can you get good at not saying anything?  Simple: use your mute button.  For most reps, the mute button is something they seldom use (do you even know where yours is?), and if they do occasionally use it, it&rsquo;s to put a prospect on hold to get some information or look something up.</p><h3> <strong>  But for top sales producers, the mute button is the most powerful button on the phone. Here&rsquo;s how to use it: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> #1: First of all, locate it, start practicing using it &ndash; you know, get comfortable with the time delay (if any) between when you turn it on and turn it off. </h3><p> <br/> Reassure yourself that there is no &lsquo;clicking&rsquo; noise and that it is absolutely seamless. </p><h3> #2: Know when to use it. </h3><p> <br/> This is simple, actually.  Whenever you ask a question of a prospect, hit your mute button.  DO NOT unmute yourself until your prospect is done with his/her thought and done speaking. </p><p> In fact, put a two to three second delay between when you think they are done and when you unmute.  This is crucial&hellip;</p><p> Special Tip Here: Contrary to what you think, your prospect does not need to hear your &lsquo;um&rsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;uh&rsquo;s&rsquo; to evidence you&rsquo;re listening.  The more absolute quiet there is, the more comfortable they&rsquo;ll feel &ndash; and the more they will talk.</p><h3> #3: Get in the habit of encouraging them to talk even more by unmuting yourself (after they are done) and asking, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What do you mean exactly?&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> Then mute yourself again and let them answer.</p><h3> #4: Take notes while they talk. </h3><p> <br/> Write down any words or phrases they say and make it a point to feed these back to them later in the conversation.  This will show them you are actively listening, and they will be more receptive to common words and phrases they use often.</p><h3> #5: The mute button is good for prospecting calls as well! </h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t just use it during the close.  In fact, your tip is that whenever your prospect is talking, you need to be on mute. </p><p> The treasure of information you&rsquo;ll get by listening and not interrupting is beyond valuable.  Not only will you get the exact reasons and motives needed to close the sale (or objections to avoid or overcome), but you&rsquo;ll get something else just as valuable: You&rsquo;ll gain trust and confidence.</p><p> Everyone loves to be heard; loves to be listened to.  Most sales people are distrusted and disliked because they are pushy and make it seem as if it&rsquo;s all about them.  You can immediately reverse this by becoming a great listener. </p><p> Quick last story: Just the other day I was speaking with a new prospect and, employing the mute button, the call went for an hour and forty minutes.  The prospect probably talked for an hour and fifteen minutes of that time.</p><p> When the call finally ended, he told me how much he enjoyed the conversation and how much he was looking forward to the next call.  And all I did was ask pointed questions and then listened while on mute&hellip;</p><p> So there you have it: the most important thing to say in sales is&hellip;..nothing!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-14 18:58:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-14 18:58:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_8hdqZex.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-number-one-thing-to-say-in-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"11050\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-14 18:58:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-14 18:58:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-number-one-thing-to-say-in-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11049\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5408\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Number-One-Thing-to-Say-in-Sales.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"393\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463403600,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

That&rsquo;s because we take in what we hear and see from our parents and create a belief system around money and what is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo;</p><p> What we don&rsquo;t always get is that sometimes, our beliefs and our &ldquo;normal&rdquo; work completely against our values and best interests. But what you may not realize is that your mindset is absolutely changeable. </p><p> And the right mindset will change not only YOUR life, but can influence those around you.</p><p> So it was with great relish that I devoured &ldquo;The Code Of The Extraordinary Mind&rdquo; (Rodale 2016), that carries the idea of mindset to a whole new level.</p><p> Author Vishen Lakhiani (the founder of Mindvalley), states that our beliefs are constructed from our &ldquo;Culturescape&rdquo;&mdash;that our culture and living situation teach us that following &ldquo;the rules&rdquo; provides safety and acceptance.</p><p> But he argues that the only rules we SHOULD be accepting as truths are the absolutes: fire is hot, water is wet, we need air to breath.

I dream things that never were and say, why not?&rdquo; &ndash; George Bernard Shaw</p><p> This blog suggests we spend more time reviewing the processes of change versus excellence. Clearly companies like Kodak and Blockbuster are examples of sticking with a formula too long. In contrast, companies frequently change executives, sell and make investments, with little or no outcome. For example, NBA teams replaced six coaches in the middle of this season, and not one of them significantly improved results.</p><p> The debate of pursuing improved excellence versus change is affected by a number of issues. We need to understand how problems affected by goals versus tactics can require different solutions. Here are some examples where organizations simply need to understand their new environment and execute fundamental change:</p><li> <strong>  Demographics are a critical factor in most businesses. </strong> The world is simply getting older and more ethnically diverse. For example, minority births represent more than 50 percent of current U.S. births.</li><li> <strong>  Organizations that don&rsquo;t understand and use the digital transformation need to change, rather than just execute. </strong> New opportunities like the cloud, Google, internet, CRM systems, digital phones, apps, etc. are simply changing the processes, costs, and marketing of business. For example, Amazon and other online retailers are revolutionizing the need for traditional brick and mortar stores to react. Similarly, sharing sites like Uber and Airbnb are revolutionizing their industries.</li><li> <strong>  Businesses are subject to more radical change and need to build mechanisms into their processes. </strong> While we will face more uncertainty and instability, we need to focus on changing and simplifying processes to reduce the risks. Strategies like pivoting, and develop/test/measure/adapt, need to be built in our organizations. <br/>  </li><p> While change is critical in many environments, we frequently ignore opportunities to do things better.

However, my step-mother was not pleased with being called &ldquo;Mrs. John Clise&rdquo;. She stated she has her own identity separate from my dad. My sister meant no offense and was simply following envelope addressing protocol.</p><p> I understand my step-mother&rsquo;s outrage. The tradition of addressing women by their husband&rsquo;s name seems very old fashioned and sexist. Much has changed since  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Post\" target=\"_blank\">  Emily Post  </a> wrote her bestselling book &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Emily-Posts-Etiquette-Thumb-Indexed/dp/0066209579\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Etiquette </a> &rdquo; in 1922. I have been grappling with how to approach this.</p><p> When a married couple does not share the same last name the proper way to address an envelope is &ldquo;Ms. Jane Smith and Mr. Brad Jones&rdquo;. That seems perfectly modern and appropriate because each has their own identity. But how do you address a married couple that has the same last name? &ldquo;Mrs. Jane and Mr. Brad Jones&rdquo;? &ldquo;Mrs. and Mr. Jane and Brad Jones&rdquo;? &ldquo;Jane and Brad Jones&rdquo;? &ldquo;The Jones&rdquo;? &ldquo;Mrs. Jane Jones and Mr. Brad Jones&rdquo;?</p><h3> And that begs another question. Do women still want to be addressed as &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; or is &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; just fine, thank you very much?</h3><p> <br/> I posed the question to the World Wide Web and I saw many iterations, much disagreement and some heated comments. Many women were very uncomfortable with being addressed by their husband&rsquo;s first and last name. However, many women were OK with it.</p><p> Here is what I think. If the married couple is older &ndash; as in in their 60s or older &ndash; and you know they are traditional, I would go ahead and address the envelope as &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Brad Jones&rdquo;. Everyone else I would address thusly: For a formal occasion, &ldquo;Ms. and Mr. Jane and Brad Jones&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t seem as clunky to me and honor&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s identity. <strong>  For an informal occasion, simply, &ldquo;Jane and Brad Jones&rdquo;. </strong></p><p> What do you think? Would you be offended if you received an invitation addressed to &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Brad Jones&rdquo;? Married women, do you prefer being called &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo;?

{"original_id":5196,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The CEO: Personal Brand, Thought Leadership and Visibility Have Never Been More Important","link":"the-ceo-personal-brand-thought-leadership-and-visibility-have-never-been-more-important","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/jen-diehl/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Jen Diehl </a>  </p><p> The role of personal brands has never been more important in shaping the image of an organization and garnering visibility. <strong>  In today&rsquo;s landscape, &ldquo;celeb CEOs&rdquo; are taking charge of bolstering their company&rsquo;s credibility by optimizing thought leadership and using their own identity to keep the brand relevant. </strong></p><p> Take a look at entrepreneur and founder of Tesla Motors and Space X, Elon Musk. Aside from pushing Tesla as an emerging automobile designer and manufacturer, Musk embodies what it means to be a thought leader and disruptor in his field. Another example is Steve Jobs, former CEO and co-founder of Apple and one of the greatest visionaries in technology and creativity the world has ever seen. Even Donald Trump, a real estate tycoon and presidential hopeful, has masterfully branded himself as the embodiment of a successful American business man.</p><p> Despite operating in completely different business worlds, these three &ldquo;celeb CEOs&rdquo; share a few common characteristics. Specifically, they position themselves at the forefront of the issues facing their industries by speaking about them in the context of what their company is doing to innovate and meet the needs of their customers and society as a whole.</p><p> In the quest for CEO visibility, there are several considerations to think about when fine-tuning an executive&rsquo;s personal brand.</p><h3> Put in the time. </h3><p> <br/> CEOs should be willing to invest the same amount of time in media training and brand exposure as they would courting a business prospect. CEOs and other C-suite executives must tackle, or at least discuss, issues on the front line of their given industry. Becoming the face of their company and a thought leader for different audiences to turn to for insight is key. For example, while the chief executive of a registered investment advisory firm could weigh in on millennial investing trends, speaking to major developments in the financial services industry on how robo-advisers are disrupting the space and how their firm is evolving given industry shifts would make a stronger impact. When you inject your CEO into broader industry conversations, personal brands emerge with authenticity and credibility.</p><h3> Connect with your audience directly. </h3><p> <br/> Contributing regularly to their company blog helps CEOs maintain a connection with an audience that already has a vested interest in the company. The beauty of blogging is that you control the conversation. Generating content straight from the &ldquo;horse&rsquo;s mouth&rdquo; has a two-fold effect. On one hand, blogging provides CEOs with a platform to strengthen their profile and voice while advocating for issues and engaging in meaningful conversations. On the other hand, frequent posts validate an authenticity with their audience that desires direct access to the higher-ups. Frequent blogging and a social media presence strengthens the CEO&rsquo;s personal brand by showcasing their expertise directly in front of relevant audiences.</p><h3> Become your brand. </h3><p> <br/> Making a CEO&rsquo;s name synonymous with their company&rsquo;s brand and its mission demonstrates commitment and builds credibility. Take Sallie Krawcheck for example, CEO and co-founder of Ellevest, a  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20160511/FREE/160519982/sallie-krawchecks-women-focused-robo-ellevest-officially-launches\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  robo-adviser specifically </a>  tailored to women&rsquo;s investment needs. Throughout her financial career, which has included management positions at Bank of America and Citi Global Wealth Management, Krawcheck has dedicated herself to opening opportunities for women in finance. By immersing herself in the conversation regarding &ldquo;women and investing,&rdquo; she built an authentic personal brand aligned with the cause. Krawcheck&rsquo;s experiences and goals in her career allow her name to be synonymous with women and investing issues, therefore, boosting her authority as a key stakeholder in the overall conversation.</p><p> Using a CEO&rsquo;s personal brand to heighten the visibility of an organization plays a vital role in marketing success. By remaining true to advocacy interests, speaking to various audiences on larger industry issues and maintaining a &ldquo;voice&rdquo; via blogging and social media, executives will build their brands with industry peers and, most importantly, clients and consumers.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-15 15:16:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-15 15:16:36.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_TJrkiLB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-ceo-personal-brand-thought-leadership-and-visibility-have-never-been-more-important/\", \"post_id\": \"11057\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-15 15:16:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-15 15:16:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-ceo-personal-brand-thought-leadership-and-visibility-have-never-been-more-important\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11056\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5412\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-CEO-Personal-Brand-Thought-Leadership-and-Visibilty-Have-Never-Been-More-Important.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1078\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463396400,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

Perhaps also these results are uniquely Australian, and everywhere else in the world consumers are smarter or better informed.  I doubt that too.</p><h3> Financial advisers have a problem.  The problem is not dumb consumers either; the problem is the industry.</h3><p> <br/> Clearly there is an issue with the financial advice industry as a whole being able to express the basics of what it does for its customers in a way that makes sense to them.  There is an issue also with being able to deliver a clear and compelling value proposition.  I separated those two out, even though they are inextricably linked, because there are clearly 2 issues at work here:</p><li> General education of what financial advisers do</li><li> Value propositions of individual firms that express their point of difference to their particular target market segment <br/>  </li><p> I strongly believe that a well defined and articulated value proposition is the central ingredient in a professionals marketing strategy, however this research suggests that possibly a great value proposition just isn&rsquo;t enough.  Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t enough if the consumers do not understand the positioning and function of the adviser to begin with.  For instance; knowing that an adviser is an investment tax planning specialist, who can ensure you lose as little as possible &ndash; legally! &ndash; in tax simply won&rsquo;t resonate with the market if they don&rsquo;t understand how and where they could be paying too much tax, or what impact that may have on them personally.</p><p> We have to accept that if consumers are essentially ignorant in respect of understanding what advisers can do and help them with then a well crafted and pointed value proposition remains meaningless.  Beautiful branding and market positioning also are meaningless until the target market understand the broader offering and range of possibilities which are available to them.</p><p> One thing should be abundantly clear to advisers by now though: consumers simply won&rsquo;t use us until they know what it is we can do for them.

{"original_id":5198,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Deliver Investors a Growing Income Stream Through Dividend Growth Investing","link":"deliver-investors-a-growing-income-stream-through-dividend-growth-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  Denver Investments </u></p><p> Many investors want to participate in the wealth-building potential of the stock market, but seek a solution that will dampen downside volatility relative to the overall market.  With historically low fixed income yields, expectations of prolonged below-trend growth in developed countries, and the continued threat of inflation on the horizon, today's investors often hunt for solutions that can not only provide a source of current income, but also a potential source of income that will grow over time.  While most investors look at the historical dividend growth of a company as a predictor of the company's future dividend intentions, we take a forward-looking approach to identify future dividend growers.</p><h3> <strong>  Dividends as a Significant Part of Total Return  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Dividends have played a significant role in the returns investors have received over the past seven decades.  Dividends have accounted for 31% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index over this 75 year period.  When reviewing the return composition by decade, dividends have been a consistent and positive source of return while providing a cushion during periods of weak equity market performance.  Dividend income has been a source of return in flat markets while the reinvestment of dividends in markets where stock prices have been depressed can accelerate and magnify the recovery of investor portfolios when markets rise.</p><p> Beyond their contribution to total return, dividends also reflect a compnay's earnings and cash flow strength.  Companies that can grow their dividend need to have a business capable of strong and growing free cash flow and a shareholder-friendly management team that is disciplined in its use of cash.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SP-500-Index-Returns.png\" width=\"589\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Lower Volatility and Better Return for Risk   </strong></h3><p> <br/> Conventional finance theory states that the only way to earn a greater return is through accepting greater risk.  However, a growing body of research suggests that greater returns have been achieved by investing in lower-volatility stocks. Dividend-growing stocks have significantly outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks over time and have done so with less volatility.  In addition, dividend growers and initiators (those companies able to raise or begin to pay dividends) outperformed the broader group of dividend-paying stocks with less volatility, thus providing an even higher return per unit of risk (higher Sharpe ratio). </p><p> While various empirical studies conclude dividend growth investing leads to lower volatility as dividend growers typically exhibit sustainable earnings and strong balance sheets, we believe the causal link is reversed: history shows companies that generate consistently high levels of cash flow offer the potential for dividend growth, superior relative returns and less risk.  Quality and consistency of a company's cash returns also correlate closely with the company's stock price volatility, a point that many dividned investors take for granted.  We refer to this subset of stocks as \"consistent cash flow (CF) generators.\"</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/risk-return.png\" width=\"571\"/></p><p> While the Sharpe ratio uses standard deviation to represent risk, the Treynor ratio uses beta as a measure of market or systematic risk.  The Treynor ratio is useful in determining how a particular investment contributes to an already diversified portfolio.  The table below illustrates that the lower the beta, all else equal, the more beneficial a new asset will be to the risk/return prospects of one's total portfolio.</p><p> Furthermore, it shows consistent cash flow is the best addition to an existing stock protfolio.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/treynor-ratio.png\" width=\"596\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Dividend Growers Can Provide an Inflation Hedge   </strong></h3><p> <br/> High-quality, dividend-growing companies can provide a hedge against inflation as income received from dividends has historically grown in line or often at higher rates than inflation.  Such companies often possess pricing power and may be able to pass cost inflation on to the end consumer by increasing prices, which allows the company to maintain or increase profitability and increase dividend payments even in periods of rising inflation.</p><p> As a result, dividend growers have been more of an inflation hedge than non-dividend-paying stocks.  As seen in Exhibit 4, since 1972, dividend growers have outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks in all types of inflationary environments.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/growth-stocks.png\" width=\"589\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Dividend Income Has Outgrown Interest Income  </strong></h3><p> <br/> While yields on bonds have tended to be higher than yields on equities at a specific point in time, inflation erodes the purchasing power of a fixed income investment over time, while dividends from stocks have the potential to outgrow inflation. We can see in Exhibit 5 that the dividend income from $100,000 investment in stocks in 1985 (as represented by the S&amp;P 500 Index) grew to $21,370.  Meanwhile, interest income from $100,000 invested in bonds (as represented by the Barclay U.S. Aggregate Bond Index) only grew to $2,591.  The yield on initial investment (left scale) for the stock investment is also significantly higher at period end at 21% versus 2% for the bond investment.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dividends-from-stocks.png\" width=\"583\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Yield and Diversification Opportunities from Global Dividend Investing   </strong></h3><p> <br/> While investors in the U.S. have become more comfortable investing overseas, others may be surprised by the number of high-quality foreign companies that benefit from globally diversified revenue streams.  In many cases, the strongest company with the greatest potential to grow its dividend in a particular sector may be found outside of the U.S. </p><p> Investing globally offers the opportunity for yield and diversification.  Foreign companies follow a tradition of returning more capital to shareholders, evidenced by the fact that dividend yields have consistently hovered approximately 100 basis points above those of their U.S. counterparts.  This provides portfolio managers with greater flexibility when constructing a portfolio.  There are also diversification benefits to investing globally.  This can lead to more consistency and help protect a portfolio against secular slowdowns.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dividend-yield-us.png\" width=\"597\"/></p><p> For more information please contact <a href=\"http://denvest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Denver Investments </a> .</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-15 17:16:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-15 17:16:52.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_01N7nXc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/deliver-investors-a-growing-income-stream-through-dividend-growth-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"11067\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-15 17:16:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-15 17:16:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"deliver-investors-a-growing-income-stream-through-dividend-growth-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11060\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5414\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Deliver-Investors-a-Growing-Income-Stream-Through-Dividend-Growth-Investing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"992\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463389200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Marie Michelli was quick to say, <strong>  &ldquo;tell me who you run around with and I&rsquo;ll tell you what you are.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> The upshot of that saying is that the people with whom you associate will define you and that we are all held accountable through our reputation. As I&rsquo;ve come to learn, my mom&rsquo;s wisdom is typically as relevant to my personal life as it is to my business dealings&hellip;therein comes Barry Torman.</p><p> Barry, is a local businessman and a true friend who often inspires me to reach further and do more in support of important social and community issues when I would otherwise be inclined to leave those matters to others. Barry is the kind of person you would want on the &ldquo;board of directors of your life.&rdquo; His latest project is a classic example and (in addition to demonstrating activism) it offers two very important lessons for leaders who are attempting to integrate technology solutions to make their businesses more responsive and accountable to those they serve.</p><p> Let me first give you a brief overview of the project, Voters Care, in the hope you will take a deeper look and possibly support it. Then I&rsquo;ll offer the two significant lessons that the project provides all of us in business today.</p><p> Not long ago Barry invited me to breakfast to talk about what has now become a website (voterscare.org) and what he hopes will be an emerging bi-partisan movement to leverage mobile technology to solicit the input of the electorate and then to hold politicians accountable for their legislative record.</p><p> As Barry explained the concept to me, I intuitively embraced the wisdom and nobleness of the effort. However, I asked questions about the viability of Voters Care and inquired as to &ldquo;why&rdquo; he would spend time and money on it.</p><p> Seeking to keep it as a non-partisan, non-profit effort and wishing to gain nothing personally from the idea, Barry answered my &ldquo;why you&rdquo; question with, &ldquo;Somebody needs to nudge accountability forward. I&rsquo;ll put the idea out and if it resonates others can make the idea better and help make it a reality.&rdquo; As is often the case, when you are around the &ldquo;right&rdquo; people, their perspective and initiative is inspiring.</p><h3> Now on to the lessons we can take away from Barry&rsquo;s idea.</h3><p> <br/> Mobile technology is pervasive. People receive so much of their information at their fingertips. Rapid dissemination of information and solicitation of feedback is also easily accomplished on mobile devices and through the world wide web.</p><p> Businesses are held accountable on social media. As such, all of us should be looking for ways to leverage the power of mobile, social, and the internet to gain feedback from our consistence (our team members and customers). Additionally, we should encourage and engage public discussions of our performance. In essence Barry&rsquo;s idea, which he is applying to the political arena, suggests that solicitation of feedback from consumers (in his case political constituents) benefits the decision-making of those who serve them. Furthermore, transparency on performance, makes businesses (in his case politicians) more accountable and better able to meet the important needs of those who rely upon them. How effectively are you using technology to inquire of your customers and report your performance?</p><p> Oh by the way, who are you hanging around with&hellip;do they inspire you? Would they say the same about you?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-15 17:27:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-15 17:27:25.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_idvLOVn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/noble-associations-transparency-and-accountability-success/\", \"post_id\": \"11071\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-15 17:27:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-15 17:27:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"noble-associations-transparency-and-accountability-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11070\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5416\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Noble-Associations-Transparency-and-Accountability-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"810\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463392800,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

He added: As companies increasingly focus on customer experience in 2014, they will recognize that their organizations lack a deep understanding and appreciation for their customers. Granted, it is now 2016, but empathy is equally important, if not more so.  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2016/03/knowledge-without-understanding-is.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Understanding your customers </a> , their needs, what they are trying to achieve, and what they are going through is critical to delivering a great experience.</p><p> I'll give you an example of the differences and how the two can be used together. I've mentioned in a few  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2016/03/is-your-customer-experience-stuff-that.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  previous posts </a>  the insurance provider I've been dealing with now for the last six months. The adjuster that was assigned to me is just awful, so I finally got to the point where I didn't want him to come to my house again without his supervisor. I've been in this situation before with my team: I know that if a client calls in a supervisor, it's time to step up the customer love, acknowledge what happened, apologize, and figure out how to make things better, in a nutshell. Clients want both sympathy and empathy in those situations. So here goes.</p><p> The adjuster and the supervisor arrive. The supervisor - a woman and a mom - barely says, \"Hello,\" doesn't look me in the eye (and didn't really ever do this during the entire meeting), and doesn't start off with something that I would say, were I called into this situation: \"I'm sorry that we are not meeting your needs. How can I make this better?\" Or simply, \"I'm sorry. I'm here to help.\" Those words - and no reasonable facsimile - ever came out of her mouth in the several hours that they were here. That would have showed sympathy.</p><p> At some point during the visit, we walked into my kitchen, which is basically non-existent. It had been damaged by a water leak, and all cabinets, appliances, etc. had been torn out. I have no kitchen. And there I stood, listening to the adjuster and his supervisor tell me that my house is livable. (By the way, the rest of my downstairs is gone, too.) I asked them both if they have children, and they do. I asked  them both if they would live in a house, with their children, with no kitchen. They both said they would, and they had, one for four months, the other for six. I'll spare you what I said after that because the next 90 seconds were a blur of profanity and disbelief. (And having now done it for three months, eating out for every meal, every day, I can tell you, I don't believe them.) I took a deep breath. I was asking for empathy. I wanted them to walk in my shoes, to know what it would mean to live in a house in the state mine was in. And while they said they knew, there was no \"I feel your pain\" moment. It was more of a smug moment. (How do I know they were telling me the truth? They'd been awful to deal with about everything else for the prior three moths.)</p><p> What I got instead was apathy, which Merriam-Webster defines as the feeling of not having much emotion or interest. \"I don't care about you.\"</p><p> Your customer experience has reached the low of lows when it gets to that point.</p><h3> So, take the time to coach your frontline about all three, and make sure that the third one is the one they never use with your customers. </h3><p> <br/> When you show deep empathy toward others, their defensive energy goes down, and positive energy replaces it. That's when you can get more creative in solving problems. -Stephen Covey</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-15 17:37:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-15 17:37:49.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_diaW3PX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/empathy-sympathy-and-apathy-why-your-client-service-team-needs-to-understand-all-three/\", \"post_id\": \"11073\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-15 17:37:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-15 17:37:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"empathy-sympathy-and-apathy-why-your-client-service-team-needs-to-understand-all-three\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11072\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5417\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Empathy-Sympathy-and-Apathy-Why-Your-Client-Service-Team-Needs-to-Understand-All-Three.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1337\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463414400,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

Instead of leaving any  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  assets </a>  to his nephews (he had no children of his own), Nobel stipulated that his fortune should be used to award prizes to &ldquo;those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.&rdquo; As a result, approximately $265 million went towards the creation of the  <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nobel Foundation </a> .</p><p> In Nobel&rsquo;s will, he explains that the prizes are to be split into five equal parts in the following areas:</p><li> &ldquo;One part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics;</li><li> One part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement;</li><li> One part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine;</li><li> One part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction;</li><li> And one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Alfred Nobel&rsquo;s last Will and testament is a perfect example of how a Will can affect lives after death &mdash; the world is constantly affected by his last wishes. It also shows that as a testator, you have a choice about how you want your estate and assets disposed of after your passing.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-15 18:14:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-15 18:14:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_PP99ZFK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/alfred-nobel-the-world-is-constantly-affected-by-his-last-wishes/\", \"post_id\": \"11075\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-15 18:14:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-15 18:14:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"alfred-nobel-the-world-is-constantly-affected-by-his-last-wishes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11074\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5418\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alfred-Nobel-The-World-Is-Constantly-Affected-by-His-Last-Wishes.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1054\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463421600,"author_id":11,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5203,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Vetr is Using CrowdSourcing to Unlock the Secrets of Investing","link":"how-vetr-is-using-crowdsourcing-to-unlock-the-secrets-of-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvyExec\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ivy Exec </a></p><p> <strong>  Ivy Exec met with Patrick Williams, a New York based entrepreneur with many successful startups under his purview for a conversation about his new endeavor, Vetr. </strong></p><p> Investing in stocks can be a daunting and unnerving process for individuals looking to enter the market in order to expand their financial portfolio; a fact that is well documented. According to Bankrate, the financial publishing powerhouse, a big reason behind this trepidation is that most people do not understand basic financial constructs of investing. In fact, despite a recent resurgence of the U.S. stock market, more than half of Americans do not feel comfortable investing in stocks.</p><h3> Vetr, a New York based fintech company, was founded with the goal of educating the public about investing by adapting crowdsourcing to evaluate, identify, and vet existing stocks.</h3><p> <br/> As an online investment research platform, Vetr attributes the same process that has made everyday decisions such as selecting restaurants, movies, shelter, and even choosing doctors a more transparent and informative process.</p><p> The Vetr team is comprised of Wall Street insiders that are intrinsically connected to the financial industry, but found very little insights available to the modern day investor; a demographic that is more concerned with understanding the more simple tenets of personal investing than anything else.</p><p> The process to participate on Vetr is simple and streamlined. Users create an account on the company&rsquo;s website to predict a stock&rsquo;s price over a specific timeframe. The staff at Vetr collects all stock predictions from its users &ndash; and using a proprietary algorithm &ndash; rate the stock using a five star rating system.</p><p> Additionally, users can leverage many of Vetr&rsquo;s other features including peer commentaries on stocks, a customized feed of analysis and ratings, and the ability to create a customized watch list to track prices, price changes, your target prices and crowd target prices for each security.</p><p> <strong>  Ivy Exec: </strong> What Makes Vetr a Valuable Resource for Users?</p><p> <strong>  Patrick Williams: </strong> It&rsquo;s been well-documented, by both government and private research, that the ability of average people to predict the likelihood of future events when their insights are aggregated together outperforms the results of even the best professional analysts.</p><p> Our main objective is not to have users sign-in and trade stocks. We are more concerned with helping people become more productive and successful investors &ndash; introducing stock predictions to everyone and to be able to compare the crowd to the Wall Street analyst. We are essentially giving away financial information for free &ndash; most people that are offering this advice are charging 1% of a client&rsquo;s overall net-worth per year.</p><p> There are a lot of conversations on the Next Generation Investor, a demographic interested in impact investing &ndash; especially when they considering how it impacts the environment and society. You can see this type of investor exists by going on Vetr and seeing the comments, analysis, and the most viewed and rated stocks. It&rsquo;s a proof of concept. I think that if a Financial Advisor refers to Vetr in a meeting, they&rsquo;ll be clued in to this demographic and be the most informed on how investors, especially the next-gen investor, is seeking to be informed about stocks.</p><p> <strong>  IE: </strong> What are Your Company&rsquo;s Growth Plans?</p><p> <strong>  PW: </strong> Vetr is blazing trails in a relatively new area, so much of our efforts have been equal parts learning, product training and market education. We&rsquo;re innovating in a nascent market so we&rsquo;re spending a good deal of time with our customers learning about how they are using our product as well as teaching customers that this is indeed a new product category. Going forward, we will continue to focus on software and product innovation and an effort to expand our user base. We will continue to improve Vetr&rsquo;s capabilities through software upgrades and launching a mobile app over the coming year. This includes performance improvements to speed and precision of our services as well as the addition of more capabilities.</p><p> <strong>  IE: </strong> What Upcoming Company Products/Releases/Strategies are you Excited to Talk About?</p><p> <strong>  PW: </strong> We are planning to grow our customized competitions in the higher education space &ndash; Vetr University Challenges.</p><p> The Vetr University Challenges involves students selecting multiple stocks and rating these stocks on the company&rsquo;s platform. These selected stocks will be averaged and the calculation will inform the ranking and points of participants. Students earn points based on the percentile for the average return of the chosen stock as well as other action prompts provided by Vetr.</p><p> In planning for an expansion of these University Challenges, we are confident that we can get more universities involved and would like to eventually implement a traditional tier of regional, state, national and international competitions among universities. Through this competition, more young people will become educated on stocks and investing.</p><p> <strong>  IE: </strong> What is the Common Denominator or Qualities Inherently Found Within Staff That You Hire?</p><p> <strong>  PW: </strong> I&rsquo;d say the common denominator would be &ldquo;smarts&rdquo;, or how people think versus their experience or what they know. As for the specific qualities, we are always looking for individuals that are willing to dream big, that have a track record of getting things done, and know how to have fun while working with others. I think it&rsquo;s important that staff get along and that they&rsquo;re able to combine this idea of hard work with being social with colleagues. We want to surround ourselves with people who not only share our vision, but culture and values too. I think you know the type of people I&rsquo;m speaking about &mdash; team players that don&rsquo;t take themselves too seriously and know how to have fun.</p><p> <strong>  IE: </strong> What is the Most Important Quality That You Look for in Hiring a Leader?</p><p> <strong>  PW: </strong> I think anyone that is looking to lead a team within a company should focus on leading from the front &ndash; literally leading the charge. They should seek to fully understand the people on their team and those working underneath them. It&rsquo;s important that they see these individuals as colleagues as opposed to simply staff. This is the best way to energize your employees and better ensures that hey are happy in relation to their work.</p><p> <strong>  IE: </strong> What do You Consider to be Your Biggest Challenge Against the Growth of Your Company?</p><p> <strong>  PW: </strong> Attracting top talent to our company. We are always on the lookout for hiring incredibly talented people. The market opportunity is massive and we need the best people we can find to execute our plan and continue on our past success.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-15 18:27:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-15 18:27:35.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_TSpVne2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-vetr-is-using-crowdsourcing-to-unlock-the-secrets-of-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"11077\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-15 18:27:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-15 18:27:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-vetr-is-using-crowdsourcing-to-unlock-the-secrets-of-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11076\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5419\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-Vetr-is-Using-CrowdSourcing-to-Unlock-the-Secrets-of-Investing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"751\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463425200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5204,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Exploring Options in the Mid-Market Institutional Advisory Space","link":"exploring-options-in-the-mid-market-institutional-advisory-space","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Institutional advisors: do you know what you need in order to best serve clients&rsquo; needs and your own business goals?</p><p> Institutional advisors &ndash; those whose clients are charitable organizations, corporations, retirement plans, Taft Hartley plans, municipalities, government entities and the like &ndash; represent a relatively small percentage of the financial advisor population at large, but typically, they have very successful businesses and are highly coveted by the competition.</p><p> Generally speaking, these advisors run their businesses from one of two different places: a wirehouse firm or some form of independence (an independent broker dealer or RIA). The world-class resources, support, favored nation pricing, scale, guardrails and brand of a major firm can give institutional clients &ndash; and the advisors that serve them &ndash; a sense of comfort and stability. Alternatively, more and more of these institutionally-focused advisors are finding their way to the independent space&mdash;either establishing their own firm or joining forces with an already established one.</p><p> Truth be told, in today&rsquo;s day and age, platform is largely a commodity and so there isn&rsquo;t much that an advisor couldn&rsquo;t access in the way of product or service, whether he is independent or an employee of a bulge bracket firm. The decision around where to run one&rsquo;s business should come down to the following:</p><li> How do I want to live my business life?</li><li> Do I see myself as an entrepreneur or an employee?</li><li> Do I want turnkey or to build something my way?</li><li> What do I value more: freedom, flexibility and control, OR brand, scale and in-house access to everything that can support my business?</li><p> Some folks operate under the belief that even though they would love to become an entrepreneur and feel limited by their employee status, their institutional clients need the deep pockets of a big firm in order to stick with them. And while many hold to this belief, it just isn&rsquo;t true.</p><p> So what is the truth when it comes to the institutional space?</p><p> Ultimately, the changing landscape has brought an evolution and much to be explored in the way of new opportunities for an independent institutional practice. And of note:</p><li> Errors and Omissions Insurance (E&amp;O) is what protects an independent RIA against claims of wrongdoing. Shirl Penney, founder and CEO of Dynasty Financial Partners says, &ldquo;The largest malfeasance claim against a team was $10 million. $10 million of E&amp;O insurance costs approximately $45,000 per year; $20 million of coverage costs approximately $75,000 per year.&rdquo; And, if an advisor doesn&rsquo;t take discretion, he has significantly less exposure. The custodian would be responsible for things such as fraudulent wire transfer. The truth is that the greatest risk rests with the custodian.</li><li> Top institutional clients and billionaire family offices believe in a model where safe asset custody, product manufacturing and advice are separated. This model is exactly what being an RIA is all about. Plus, ultra-high net worth and institutional clients value an independent voice and transparency in fees.</li><li> Independence offers more flexibility, true open architecture access, and the ability to customize the client service model, as well as a broader world-view from a research perspective, and the ability to be multi-custodial with cutting edge technology to tie it all together.</li><p> At the end of the day, some people are just more comfortable as an employee, especially given a more onerous regulatory environment. They have no desire to manage the minutia of running a business, or to take on the attendant risk; the easy access to best-in-class resources and solutions is what they value most. There is no judgment in that statement at all. From where I sit, it&rsquo;s why Baskin Robbins makes 31 flavors of ice cream.</p><p> It&rsquo;s all about choice.  Don&rsquo;t stay put because you feel jailed by the belief that, &ldquo;My institutional clients would never get comfortable with me leaving a major firm and going independent.&rdquo; Clients are far more dedicated to honest, hard-working advisors who they recognize act as fiduciaries with their best interests at heart than they are to the brand name on their monthly statements. Consider, first and foremost, where you can serve them best and use that as your guidance going forward.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 15:14:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 15:14:22.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_sB5HgGH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/exploring-options-in-the-mid-market-institutional-advisory-space/\", \"post_id\": \"11079\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 15:14:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 15:14:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"exploring-options-in-the-mid-market-institutional-advisory-space\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11078\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5420\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Exploring-Options-in-the-Mid-Market-Institutional-Advisory-Space.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"638\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463511600,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

That one day we&rsquo;re one way &ndash; believing we&rsquo;re capable of certain things and incapable of others &ndash; and the next day we&rsquo;re changed? Transformed. Almost miraculously. I do think that transformation works like this. I&rsquo;ve seen it too many times.</p><p> I&rsquo;m thinking about one person in particular as I write this.  When John* showed up in OnStage Leadership he believed that he couldn&rsquo;t. Couldn&rsquo;t speak in public. Couldn&rsquo;t succeed. Couldn&rsquo;t. His fear was so overwhelming that he was convinced that he simply couldn&rsquo;t do these things.  Yet as I got to know John, I could see that he was one of the most courageous people I have ever met.  He had put himself in situations that scared him on purpose, forcing himself to learn and grow. He had left the familiarity of his small town in middle America to take a job in NYC, to figure things out and get to know himself. John is an extraordinarily brave person.  His problem wasn&rsquo;t his bravery.  His problem wasn&rsquo;t that he wasn&rsquo;t capable, or bright, or talented.  He is all these things.  His problem was that he couldn&rsquo;t see all that he is.</p><p> His problem wasn&rsquo;t that he wasn&rsquo;t capable, or bright, or talented. He is all these things.

But the truth is, there are more people out there suffering from not seeing their greatness than there are people from an inflated sense of themselves.  Most of the time when people are boasting and showing off it has nothing to do with them thinking they&rsquo;re &ldquo;all that&ldquo;, most of the time it&rsquo;s because inside they think so little of themselves that they need to prove to the world that they&rsquo;re okay.

What could be celebrated?</p><h3> Consider, as a leader, that the most important thing you could do is to help the people you lead see how truly extraordinary they are and can be. <br/>  </h3><p> All John needed was for someone to hold up the mirror. To show him, without judgement or agenda, who he really is. For when he got it &ndash; maybe for the first time in his life &ndash; a transformation took place. He stepped into his most powerful self, and it was breathtaking.  It&rsquo;s been two years since I had a chance to work with John, and he continues to perform at a level he never thought possible for himself. </p><p> We can all do that for someone.

{"original_id":5206,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Preserver, Accumulator, Follower, Independent: Which Investor Personality Are You?","link":"preserver-accumulator-follower-independent-which-investor-personality-are-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to many studies, our different personality traits and preferences, along with a range of emotional and mental behavioral biases, have a strong impact on the way we invest. </p><p> This is commonly referred to as behavioral finance. As part of a two-part series on Behavioral Finance, we will start by exploring the different personality types of most investors. When it comes to money and investing, there are many factors that contribute to the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; of important financial decisions.</p><h3> Investor Personality Types</h3><p> There are four different types of investors, according to the CFA Institute, each with their own distinct behavioral biases. Understanding your own investor personality type can go a long way toward helping you determine and meet your long term investment goals, as well as producing better returns.</p><p> Which of these profiles best describes you?</p><h3> 1. Preservers</h3><p> Preservers are investors who place a great deal of emphasis on financial security and on preserving wealth rather than taking risks to grow wealth. Preservers watch closely over their assets and are anxious about losses and short-term performance. Preservers also have trouble taking action for fear of making the wrong investments decisions.</p><p> Common Issues with Preservers: An investment strategy should take into account short-, mid- and long-term goals. By overemphasizing short-term returns, an investor risks making an emotional decision based on the short-term performance, which may end up being more detrimental to them in the long run.</p><h3> 2. Accumulators</h3><p> Accumulators are investors who are interested in accumulating wealth and are confident they can do so. Accumulators tend to want to steer the ship when it comes to making investment decisions. They are risk takers and typically believe that whatever path they choose is the correct one. Accumulators have frequently been successful in prior business endeavors and are confident that they will make successful investors as well.</p><p> Common issue with Accumulators: Overconfidence. We recently wrote a blog on the issue with stock picking and active management. Overconfidence is a natural human tendency. As investors, accumulators consistently overestimate their ability to predict future returns. History has shown that it is impossible to predict markets at large scale, yet accumulators continue to try and do so and expose themselves to extreme risk.</p><h3> 3. Followers</h3><p> Followers are investors who tend to follow the lead of their friends and colleagues, a general investing fad, or the status quo, rather than having their own ideas or making their own decisions about investing. Followers may lack interest and/or knowledge of the financial markets and their decision-making process may lack a long-term plan.</p><p> Common Issues with Followers: The herd mentality is a concept of investors piling into the same investments as others. This is often the basis of investment bubbles and subsequent crashes in the stock market. When you are a follower, you are typically following fund managers who have tools and recourses to act on new information in a fraction of a second. By the time the average investor &ldquo;follows&rdquo; them into a position, it is often too late. It is always important to understand your investment decisions and how they fit into your overall plan.</p><h3> 4. Independents</h3><p> Independents are investors who have original ideas about investing and like to be involved in the investment process. Unlike followers, they are very interested in the process of investing, and are engaged in the financial markets. Many Independents are analytical and critical thinkers and trust themselves to make confident and informed decisions, but risk the pitfalls of only following their own research.</p><p> Common Issues with Independents: Similar to overconfidence bias associated with accumulators, independents face similar issues with relying too heavily on their own train of thought. We as humans have ability to convince ourselves that we are correct or that we don&rsquo;t need guidance, even when that is not the case.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 15:35:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 15:35:32.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_tD5szcz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/preserver-accumulator-follower-independent-which-investor-personality-are-you/\", \"post_id\": \"11083\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 15:35:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 15:35:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"preserver-accumulator-follower-independent-which-investor-personality-are-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11082\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5422\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Preserver-Accumulator-Follower-Independent-Which-Investor-Personality-Are-You.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"4366\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463486400,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5207,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Can a Company Be Socially Responsible as Well as Profitable?","link":"can-a-company-be-socially-responsible-as-well-as-profitable","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Can you Serve Two Masters&rdquo; is the title to an article published by Mrs Moneypenny. </h3><p> <br/> She had attended a conference in Davos where the subject was about socially responsible capitalism&ndash;in other words, can a company be socially responsible as well as profitable? Under one corporate structure, is it possible to make the shareholders happy according to their standards as well as provide the means to care for humanity and the well-being of others? A debate between economic return vs. social return and can the two co-exist under one &ldquo;ruler-ship&rdquo;. </p><p> I have this love for words and language. And I become especially interested in a written piece when I notice that the words being used to express an idea or concept become displaced or confusing. For instance, in the debate between economic return and social return, two words in particular jumped out at me&hellip; &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment&rdquo;.  And in keeping with the subject at hand, another word for &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; is &ldquo;gift&rdquo;.</p><p> There was a member in the Davos audience that believed &ldquo;commercial companies should state their social responsibility goals and be held to account by shareholders if they did not achieve them.&rdquo;  And I ask, to what extent? To see if the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;gift&rdquo; undermined their economic return? Then in my opinion, the &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t really a gift. If this gift in some way &lsquo;took away from&rsquo; the bottom line,then the gift was an &ldquo;investment&rdquo; and the investment failed to meet expectations. What was the primary motivating factor for giving the money? A return on investment or to enhance the well-being of another?  If the desire is to create a healthier and happier world and we take action from that place, can we trust that the money would follow?</p><h3> So, which is it&hellip;a &ldquo;gift&rdquo; or an &ldquo;investment&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> In my mind, it can only be one or the other. A&ldquo;gift&rdquo; is that which you offer freely, without expectation of return and absent of fear of loss or resentment. An &ldquo;investment&rdquo; on the other hand, has the expectation of return/reward. Perhaps in response to the accountability of social responsibility goals, what could be measured is the value the &ldquo;contribution/gift&rdquo; made in the lives of the benefactors.  I am of the belief that to give and receive are the same&ndash;to give IS to receive, therefore the overall benefits cannot be quantified solely by dollars and economics. One must look at how these gifts enriched the lives and souls of those that received the contribution. When we take this perspective, the gifts and rewards become priceless and the &ldquo;giver&rdquo; becomes the &ldquo;gifted&rdquo;. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 15:36:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 15:36:57.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_G5fqOTj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/can-a-company-be-socially-responsible-as-well-as-profitable/\", \"post_id\": \"11084\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 15:36:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 15:36:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"can-a-company-be-socially-responsible-as-well-as-profitable\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11082\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5423\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Preserver-Accumulator-Follower-Independent-Which-Investor-Personality-Are-You.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"555\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463497200,"author_id":113,"chart_url":""}

Why It's Time to Stop","link":"do-you-underestimate-your-influence-why-its-time-to-stop","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Innovation is inspiring. We all love a good story about someone with a big idea, the passion to pursue it and the determination to see it through to the finish. Yet when we read or watch those stories, it can be all too easy to feel we don&rsquo;t have the chops to be innovative in our own careers. We underestimate our influence.</p><p> Many of us fear rejection. We don&rsquo;t want to rock the boat, and we&rsquo;re embarrassed about what people will think if we ask for help. The reasoning may seem valid in the moment, but in truth the potential loss is minuscule when compared to what you have to gain. On an individual level, this is about empowering yourself. You&rsquo;ve got more influence and persuasive power than you realize.</p><h3> Innovation Is Not a Linear Concept</h3><p> <br/> The first thing to remember is that most bosses and businesses value attempts at innovation, even if the idea in question turns out to be a dud. That&rsquo;s not to say your idea will be a dud, just that it&rsquo;s okay to be wrong, too. The best ideas don&rsquo;t come like a bolt of lightning. They take time to develop, and development means introducing your concept to the world (or at least to your supervisor).</p><p> The key is to present your ideas with passion. When the people around you see that you believe strongly in your idea, they&rsquo;re more likely to be receptive. Passion and persuasion go hand-in-hand.</p><h3> The Most Successful Companies Encourage Innovation</h3><p> <br/> So how is it that certain brands earn reputations as consistent innovators? It doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident.</p><p> Amazon does it by hiring with a mission to delight customers&mdash;and giving those employees the room to explore new avenues (but expecting data to back it up). Some people find that restrictive, but others see it as a springboard to innovation.</p><p> Google does it by considering and backing outlandish innovations that could change the world if they work (they call those ideas Moon Shots). CEO Larry Page doesn&rsquo;t believe in doing things in small, safe, incremental bits, and his belief in Moon Shots can be summed up in one sentence: Go Big or Go Home.</p><p> Apple does it by, among other things, putting a focus on diversity in hiring. Their belief is that a diverse employee pool will collaborate more effectively and spark more and better ideas. And they put their money where their mouth is&mdash;by reporting how they&rsquo;re doing in diversity hiring right on their website.</p><p> These are three vastly different companies, but each inspires innovation by creating effective relationships between employees and management in their own way. And that&rsquo;s the key&mdash;opening dialogue between employees and leadership, and fostering a culture that rewards collaboration and the offering of new ideas.</p><p> In the end, it still all comes back to relationships. Relationships between employees, peers and leadership should, ideally, create a culture that inspires innovation. However, as individuals, we still need to be willing to put our ideas out there, even if we&rsquo;re afraid they won&rsquo;t be well received. Don&rsquo;t under-estimate yourself. Believe in yourself&mdash;and bring your passion to the table. And remember, you are more influential than you think.</p><p> This originally appeared on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ted Rubin  </u> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 15:41:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 15:41:22.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_mo8PPUm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-underestimate-your-influence-why-its-time-to-stop/\", \"post_id\": \"11086\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 15:41:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 15:41:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-underestimate-your-influence-why-its-time-to-stop\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11085\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5424\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-You-Underestimate-Your-Influence-Why-Its-Time-to-Stop.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"756\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463500800,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

A dream vacation and thousands of years of history in every direction.</h3><p> <br/> And there&rsquo;s my son on the floor of our hotel room crying that he can no longer walk because his feet hurt.</p><p> After trying to calm him, my frustration hit a breaking point.</p><p> \"You need to man up!\" I yelled at him.</p><p> As if it came from someone else&rsquo;s mouth, my son and I both heard the words at the same time. And as if my own realization of what I had just said wasn&rsquo;t heartbreaking enough...</p><p> \"I hear it all the time, Mom!\" he sobbed, \"I just never expected to hear it from YOU!\"</p><p> My heart froze.</p><p> &ldquo;Man up.&rdquo; A phrase that suddenly felt as cruel and antiquated as digs like &ldquo;throwing like a girl&rdquo; or &ldquo;running like a girl.&rdquo;</p><p> To think that I, his own mother, hurt him with words that made him feel like any less of a person than whatever \"standards\" he is supposed to be living up to &ndash; it still makes my eyes well up.</p><p> Though my words were poorly chosen that day, my message was simply meant to say that sometimes you just need to push through.</p><p> I like to believe that the only expectations I have of my kids are that they grow up to be thoughtful enough to stand up for others, confident enough to stand up for themselves and self-sufficient enough to make good decisions and do the right thing.</p><p> Guiding them down that path often means that I am the first one to shine a spotlight on their mistakes or poor judgement and tell them how to correct them &ndash; very often while yelling.</p><p> Is that good parenting though? Or am I toeing some line of becoming the bully that today&rsquo;s society so vehemently despises?</p><p> This question has been plaguing me since last week when my son crumbled to tears because I yelled at him for taking so long to get ready for school. When the yelling stopped, I stormed up the stairs to get clothes &ndash; any clothes &ndash; for him to wear despite his begging to let him pick them out himself.</p><p> Admittedly, anger was a rough reaction to a simple issue - if this had been the first time it had happened. But this was an issue that we have had 100 or 500 times over.</p><h3> I had just had it.

Their friends are their friends.

Notice the description line in this message states, &ldquo;You can only view profiles of users within your network.&rdquo; Now you&rsquo;re thinking, then why can I send connection requests to people with whom I am not a 1st degree connection?</p><p> Let me explain. While your LinkedIn network extends further than your 1st degree connections, it doesn&rsquo;t span all members of LinkedIn.</p><h3> Who is in your network?</h3><p> You network consists of your 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree connections, plus your group members.</p><h3> Getting back to the basics.</h3><p> Your 1st degree connections are the professionals you are directly connected to as a result of accepting an invitation request, or them accepting your connection request.</p><p> Your 2nd degree connections are all of the professionals that are connected to your 1st degree connections, but not connected to you.</p><p> Your 3rd degree connections are all of the professionals that are connected to your second degree connections, but not your 1st degree connections.</p><p> Your Fellow Group Members are all of the professional you are in a group with, regardless of their connection level to you. This could be a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 100th degree connection, etc. This is yet another reason becoming members of LinkedIn groups is so crucial &ndash; it expands your network as well as your reach on many levels.</p><h3> How do you identify which each professional is and how do you connect with these professionals?</h3><p> Your 1st degree connections: you are already connected. You will see a &ldquo;1st&rdquo; next to their name.</p><p> Your 2nd degree connections: you are just 1 connection away from these professionals. You will see a &ldquo;2nd&rdquo; next to their name. Simply click &ldquo;connect&rdquo; to send a connection request. Don&rsquo;t forget to customize your connection request! IMO, the most boring sentence I can read on LinkedIn is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to add you to my professional network.&rdquo; Be original!</p><p> Your 3rd degree connections: you are 2 connections away from these professionals. You will see a 3rd next to their name. Connecting will depend ontheir settings. If you can see their full name displayed, then you can click connect to send a connection request. If you can only see their first name and last initial, you will have to send them an InMail to contact them. InMails are not connection requests.</p><p> Your Fellow Group Members: You will see the &ldquo;Group&rdquo; icon next to their name. Your common connection is the fact that you are in the same group. You can send them a message directly from their profile or you can message them right from the group.</p><p> Now that you know how far your network reaches, what will you do to expand your reach?</p><p> I hope you found this information helpful!

{"original_id":5211,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Case for Dividend Quality: A Multi-Faceted Approach","link":"the-case-for-dividend-quality-a-multi-faceted-approach","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It&rsquo;s to see my dividends coming in.&rdquo; &mdash; JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER</h3><p> <br/> Rockefeller&rsquo;s sentiment above remains true for many investors. For decades, dividend income has been a crucial component of a stock investor&rsquo;s total return, often trumping capital appreciation in volatile markets. In this recent environment of falling yields on bonds with interest rates at or near zero, dividends are especially valued. That is when income-seeking investors start to include dividends in their search for yield to meet their financial goals. Blindly focusing on yield, however, could be dangerous to an investment portfolio&rsquo;s health. A seemingly generous dividend yield may actually signify a weak share price tied to negative news not yet revealed in the quarterly dividend. Yields for a current year are often estimated using the previous year&rsquo;s dividend yield or by taking the latest quarterly yield, multiplying by four and dividing by the current share price. This explains why investors in dividend stocks must be confident the dividend being paid is sustainable. In other words, make sure the payout is well covered and the company can grow it over time.</p><h3> FLAWED DIVIDEND STRATEGIES MAY CLOUD INVESTOR JUDGEMENT</h3><p> <br/> Over the years, investors have applied various strategies to avoid overpaying for dividend yield. First, if a company has paid dividends over a long time period (often referred to as longevity), investors trust it will likely continue paying a dividend in the future.2 The alternative, focusing on a dividend&rsquo;s growth over time, views a reduction in the current distribution as a red flag that the dividend may be pared back further in the future.</p><p> There are flaws in both strategies:</p><li> Reacting to a reduced dividend after it occurs results in holding the dividend-paying security until the next rebalance, potentially after the stock price has absorbed the negative dividend news;</li><li> In order to evaluate a company, a long history of dividend payouts (often a decade or more) may be required, which means newer dividend payers are excluded from consideration; and</li><li> Recent changes in the macro environment that could affect the company&rsquo;s ability to maintain or grow its dividend may be downplayed. <br/>  </li><p> A third strategy is using the payout ratio &ndash; the dividend per share divided by earnings per share &ndash; to evaluate a dividend payer&rsquo;s financial health. While correct directionally, the payout ratio strategy also possesses several drawbacks. It looks only at the dividend in reference to &ldquo;the bottom line,&rdquo; so it may not tell the full story. For instance, it gives no guidance about a company&rsquo;s flexibility in managing its income nor does it consider any competitive advantages to protect the firm during periods of market distress. More importantly, it evaluates the distribution in terms of accounting income and not actual cash flow. Further, a singular focus on payout ratios may eliminate companies in mature industries that return most of their income to shareholders but are financially stable and well-positioned to maintain that dividend rate.</p><h3> A BETTER APPROACH &ndash; FOCUSING ON THE CORE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE DIVIDEND-PAYING COMPANY</h3><p> <br/> So, how can investors judge a &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; yield? Measuring a company&rsquo;s core financial health makes it possible to evaluate whether it may increase (or need to decrease) its future dividends. With this approach, the reliance on publicly available financial data means new dividend payers can be evaluated similarly to stocks that have paid dividends for decades. By using several lenses to evaluate financial health, an investor can gain a strong sense of how well-positioned a dividend-paying company is for success, and how protected future dividends are under current market and economic environments.</p><p> FlexShares&rsquo; multi-faceted Dividend Quality Score (DQS) examines companies using three lenses in its Dividend Quality Index methodology (see Figure 1):</p><li> Management efficiency is a quantitative evaluation of a firm&rsquo;s deployment of capital as well as its financing decisions. Research finds firms that aggressively pursue capital expenditures and additional financing lose flexibility in both advantageous and challenging portions of the market cycle.</li><li> Profitability scores a firm&rsquo;s relative competitive advantage across several different metrics. Firms with wider margins are better positioned to grow and maintain their dividends than firms with slimmer margins.</li><li> Cash flow assesses the liquidity levels of the company. A firm that cannot meet its debt obligations and day-to-day liquidity needs will struggle to maintain its dividend level. <br/>  </li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dividend-quality.png\" width=\"489\"/></p><p> The DQS score evaluates dividend-paying equities across all these lenses and ranks companies on a sector basis. (For international dividend payers, the DQS score evaluates firms on both a regional and sector basis.) This not only helps ensure an &ldquo;apples-to-apples&rdquo; comparison &ndash; profiling similar firms against each other &ndash; it also identifies quality companies in every sector (and country for international markets), supporting diversification even in the initial construction process. </p><h3> <strong>  MAXIMIZING QUALITY AND YIELD </strong></h3><p> <br/> FlexShares&rsquo; DQS process is designed to maximize quality and yield while putting several diversification controls into effect. The strategy strives to harness dividend quality and yield through its selection and weighting process. Non-dividend payers are eliminated from the universe of large cap equities, as are the lowest 20 percent of companies in the DQS ranking. </p><p> For more information please visit us  <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> .</p><p>  </p>1 Source: Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp<br/>2 Dividends represent past performance, and there is no guarantee they will continue to be paid.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 16:18:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 16:18:18.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_2kEesOV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-case-for-dividend-quality-a-multi-faceted-approach/\", \"post_id\": \"11094\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 16:18:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 16:18:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-case-for-dividend-quality-a-multi-faceted-approach\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11092\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5427\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Case-for-Dividend-Quality-A-Multi-Faceted-Approach.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1203\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463544000,"author_id":443,"chart_url":""}

Whether you are blindsided by a significant event that hits the news or the sales efforts of a competitor, you are only left to wonder what you could have done differently.</p><p> Weeks and in some cases years of effort can go for naught.</p><p> Although there are no silver bullet solutions, the best long-term strategy for avoiding unexpected prospecting surprises is treating your top prospects as if they are already clients.</p><p> This process helps you eliminate the common misperception that all advisors are the same.</p><p> As you show your future clients how they will be treated once they become actual clients of your practice, they realize you are a professional and not just a product pusher.</p><p> When your prospects can see how your current recommendation will evolve into multi-dimensional solutions, they recognize the advantages of developing a lasting relationship.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s dive in&hellip;</p><p> 5 Steps for Treating Your Top Prospects Like Clients</p><h3> 1. Decide which of your prospective clients truly have the potential to become ideal clients of your practice.</h3><p> All too often financial advisors allow prospects to slip into their databases before they are qualified.</p><p> This may mean spending weeks or months courting someone who does not meet financial or other important qualifications.</p><h3> 2. Make sure you understand both the long-term and short-term financial needs of your qualified future clients.</h3><p> When you treat every prospect the same, they will view you as someone who provides &ldquo;cookie cutter&rdquo; solutions.</p><p> Therefore, before you can treat a top prospect like an ideal client, you need to understand their financial goals. This will allow you to customize your ongoing communication and follow-up.</p><h3> 3. Record the personal interests of your top prospects.</h3><p> Just like your clients, your top prospects want to be thought of as more than their money.</p><p> Take a genuine interest in personal matters like family, hobbies and businesses.</p><p> Include these interests in your notes and contact management system as a means to stay connected on a personal level.</p><h3> 4. Create a communication calendar based on both financial and personal interests.</h3><p> Once you identify your top prospects and understand their interests, you need to build a communication calendar which allows you to maintain constant contact.</p><p> From scheduled letters, calls and appointments to impromptu handwritten notes, your prospect communication should mirror your ideal client communication.</p><p> In fact, to keep it simple, you may want to re-purpose your client communications to fit the needs of your prospects.</p><h3> 5. Be prepared to tell your top prospects your complete story (as often as possible).</h3><p> You need to be sure your top prospects understand your unique value proposition.</p><p> No matter how hard you may try to articulate the full scope of your services, over the course of time many of your prospects may form a narrow view of your practice.</p><p> This view is based on how they see you meeting their current needs.</p><p> But when you think about relationships with your ideal clients, they are multi-dimensional.</p><p> Repeatedly reinforcing your complete story will help your future clients picture your ability to work with them through changing times and with ongoing challenges.</p><p> The advisor I referenced in my opening example did a good job of identifying a future ideal client and knowing when the prospect would be in a position to take action.</p><p> But my further conversation with this advisor uncovered the fact that his contact with this prospect was limited to 2 &ldquo;touching base&rdquo; telephone calls per year.</p><p> Over a 3 to 4 year period of time, he made no attempt to get to know his &ldquo;humongous prospect&rdquo; more personally.</p><p> The prospect was given little opportunity to get to know how this new advisor would be different from her current advisor.</p><p> In the end, she took the easy way out. The advisor&rsquo;s patience and persistence was thwarted by poor positioning.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 16:29:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 16:29:22.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_ohInwIj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-steps-for-treating-your-top-prospects-like-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"11096\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 16:29:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 16:29:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-steps-for-treating-your-top-prospects-like-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11095\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5428\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5-Steps-for-Treating-Your-Top-Prospects-Like-Clients_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"870\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463475600,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}

The new Department of Labor rule requiring brokers to act in a fiduciary capacity when dealing with retirement plan assets has not made it any easier. The government's intent was to help consumers clearly distinguish when financial professionals can be relied upon to give unbiased financial advice or when they are acting in their own interests to sell a financial product. Unfortunately, the rule has only exacerbated the confusion. </p><p> When shopping for financial advisers, you need to investigate their education, niche, process, compensation structure, and experience to see whether they are a good fit for your needs. Equally important, it&rsquo;s up to you to do a background check and determine whose interest the adviser is looking out for. No one else will do it for you. Here are two important steps you can take to greatly increase your chances of getting someone who will truly be looking out for you.</p><p> First, ask any adviser you deal with to sign a statement affirming they will act in the capacity of a fiduciary to you, meaning you will be a client, not a customer. A copy of this form can be found at <a href=\"http://www.advisorperspectives.com/pdfs/FIDUCIARY_OATH-INDIVIDUAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.advisorperspectives.com </a> . Advisers unwilling to sign the form are not likely to be fiduciaries who will put your interests first.</p><p> Second, check the adviser&rsquo;s background. If advisers receive any type of fee, they are held to a fiduciary standard automatically by the SEC. Still, it's wise to check their background for any misconduct, which you can do at <a href=\"http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">  www.adviserinfo.sec.gov </a> . If advisers sell securities, mutual funds, private REITs, or limited partnerships and receive any type of commission, they will be regulated by FINRA. You can go to <a href=\"http://brokercheck.finra.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BrokerCheck.finra.org </a> to view their records for misconduct.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to check an adviser&rsquo;s background because being found guilty of misconduct doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t actively be selling financial products. In a March 7 article at kitces.com, financial planner and writer Michael Kitces points out that over 73% of FINRA-registered brokers who FINRA lists as having a misconduct \"are still employed a year later, despite the fact that such brokers are a whopping 5x more likely to engage in misconduct again in the future.\"</p><p> Kitces explains that while just 7.3% of all FINRA brokers have some type of misconduct on their records, only about half of them actually lose their jobs and about half of those find employment with another firm. Additionally, it seems some firms have more of a culture of employing brokers with misconduct.</p><p> The top five brokerage firms with the highest (15% or more) concentration of brokers with misconduct are Oppenhiemer &amp; Co, First Allied Securities, Wells Fargo Advisers Financial Network, UBS Financial Services, and Cetera Advisers. This is according to a working paper, \"The Market for Financial Adviser Misconduct,\" by Mark Egan, Gregor Matvos, and Amit Seru, business school professors at the University of Chicago and University of Minnesota. Geographic location also makes a big difference with the states of California, Florida, and New York having counties with much higher concentrations of brokers guilty of misconduct (15 &ndash; 30%) than states like Pennsylvania, Kansas, Iowa, Kentucky, and Vermont with the counties having the lowest concentration (2 &ndash; 3%).</p><p> Kitces reminds us that the \"single greatest predictor of whether a broker will engage in misconduct is whether he/she has engaged in any prior misconduct.\" For this reason, it's crucial to make FINRA's BrokerCheck part of your research before hiring a financial adviser. Before trusting any adviser to put your interests first, look out for your own interests by investigating the adviser's history.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 16:44:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 16:44:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_kc1rqUK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/shopping-for-a-financial-adviser-why-you-must-investigate-their-history/\", \"post_id\": \"11098\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 16:44:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 16:44:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"shopping-for-a-financial-adviser-why-you-must-investigate-their-history\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11097\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5429\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shopping-for-a-Financial-Adviser-Why-You-MUST-Investigate-Their-History.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"713\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463482800,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

They control a lot of money, make the family financial decisions, are more loyal, and refer you more business.  You know what the potential is for your practice.</h3><p> <br/> But what is the one thing that women really want from YOU, the financial advisor?</p><p> The same thing as men&hellip;TRUST.  Easier said than done.</p><p> A recent MetLife study at the nonprofit Womens Institute for a Secure Retirement found that 61% of women executives (earnings of at least $75,000 annually) cite trust and respect as the most important factor in choosing and keeping a financial advisor.</p><p> As a financial advisor, you envision yourself as a relationship expert, being able to easily identify personality traits with the well-crafted questions asked in your initial consultation.  While you may be highly intuitive, you will only be guessing about your conclusions by using this random &ldquo;hit or miss&rdquo; strategy.  Research shows you only naturally connect with roughly 40% of your clients.</p><p> Building trust is most effortless when your communication style is matched with a similar style of a potential client. If you are the opposite style, you can still build trust but it will take a lot of modification and you will find yourself being drained by the relationship.</p><p> So how do you build trust with women? 84% of wealthy women interviewed by Schwab said that in-person meetings are key for establishing trust.  The research also adds that, &ldquo;women want to be understood for their unique circumstances. You can&rsquo;t just walk in with the same package for male clients and change the font to pink and think the women are going to be fooled.&rdquo;</p><h3> Building trust starts with knowing YOU first.</h3><p> <br/> Your behavior is the foundation for you to tailor your strategies with women.  How trusting are you?  Do you need to be in control at all times?  Are you a natural listener or can you hardly wait to complete someone else&rsquo;s sentence?</p><p> Next, you need to understand the behavior of each individual woman. They (like men) are not all the same.  Some women will want to be in total control, get to the bottom line quickly and will want to engage in minimal personal small talk. Others will want to build a deep relationship, talk a lot, and care very little for the details of your business.</p><p> When you are equipped with behavioral information you can then create the marketing approach that best attracts the type of woman you want as a client. So take our industry&rsquo;s advice about marketing to women by educating, moving to a relationship based model and getting personal through stories. But be sure to create unique experiences based on who these women are.  Customization is the new normal.</p><p> Dare to go one step further to build the level of trust that will keep women as clients for life.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 17:18:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 17:18:42.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_2FWJ69B.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/so-how-do-you-build-trust-with-women/\", \"post_id\": \"11102\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 17:18:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 17:18:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"so-how-do-you-build-trust-with-women\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11101\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5431\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/So-How-Do-You-Build-Trust-With-Women.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"698\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463419020,"author_id":384,"chart_url":""}

It seems, the more hungry you are for the sale, the less effective your networking activities will prove to be. Many professionals join their local Chamber of Commerce or business-networking group, and are initially excited at the prospects. But the unfortunate reality is that these groups often don&rsquo;t live up to expectations; so we quit and look for another way to drive sales to our business. But wait! There are principles of networking that do work &ndash; and they may be the opposite of what you may believe about networking.</p><p> When writing the book,  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118156285/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118156285&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=redzonemarket-20&amp;linkId=Q2K4AHOR66KHQ2CI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Connectors </a> , I observed fairly quickly that the most successful businesspeople I interviewed were incredibly skilled at networking.

Instead, success tends to come from focusing on building advocate relationships &ndash; those that turn into referral connections. These connections serve as potential conduits to other potential clients. So the secret is that successful networking is founded in the desire to build a mutually beneficial relationship with someone who is a connector, and one that may never even buy your product or service.</p><p> Networking, in essence, is not exactly about who you meet in your networking activities &ndash; it&rsquo;s about who they know.

{"original_id":5217,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Saying No to More Non Ideal Clients Is Liberating!","link":"why-saying-no-to-more-non-ideal-clients-is-liberating","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Being a financial advisor for over 20 years, you know how hard it was to find new clients when you first started. You love helping people with their finances and solving their problems. Now you are at capacity or even worse, past capacity. You cannot find the time for yourself for exercise, personal interests or even friends. It seems it is family and work all the time, but mostly work. You enjoy what you do, but deep down you find it hard to say no to people who ask for your help. But, to grow, deep down you know you need to start saying no to clients and prospects.</p><h3> Saying yes is eating into your personal time</h3><p> <br/> Every time you say yes to a new client or prospect, who does not meet your ideal client criteria is costing you, not generating revenue. Think of the time it is taking away from ideal clients, and even your personal time, family and health. I know it is not easy. You spent years building a practice, only to turn people away. Every time you say yes, 10- 20 hours or more of your personal time is gone, and you can never get it back.</p><h3> Draw a line in the sand</h3><p> <br/> How can you draw a line in the sand and say no to non ideal clients and prospects? Let's start by identifying an ideal client or ideal household. First off, what is the revenue target you want to generate from a new client? What is the upfront revenue and ongoing revenue you would take on a new ideal client? When I do this exercise for advisors, the typical answer is around $4-5000. I find this fascinating, when we calculate the cost of acquiring a client is around $6000. In my workshops, I ask advisors how many hours does it take in the first year to acquire a new client. This includes prep, planning, meeting time, paperwork and follow up meetings and time. Add it all up and the typical answer is 20 hours, and at $300 per hour, the break even cost of your time acquiring a new ideal client is $6000. Now I know what you are thinking, when you read this. I am a financial advisor and I do not charge per hour. The point is that you need to understand the cost of doing business, not charge per hour that way, but have a clear way to measure it. Some clients you spend less time and make more.</p><h3> The 1800 exercise</h3><p> <br/> If you really want to know how much your time is worth, simply take 1800 ( Approximate number of hours a financial advisor works in a calendar year) and divide it by your annual revenue last year. This will tell you what an hour of time is worth. Now taking on a new ideal client, you can calculate ideal revenue you want to make, to take on a new ideal client. It may be that your practice is more focused on insurance, so more revenue up front than ongoing, such as a fee based investment practice. Write down your ideal client revenue year 1 $ __________ and your ideal client recurring revenue per year $___________ . I would also clarify two things when identifying ideal clients. First, look at ideal households, they may be part of a household, as children of wealthy parents do not need to be ideal clients and ideal revenue. They are part of an ideal household. Second, there is always some work you will do for little or no fee. For example, in helping low income seniors understand finances, or other situations that you feel are important. It just cannot be a major use of your time. There may be other circumstances, such as transactional clients, but it should account for less than 20 percent of your time and revenue.</p><h3> Saying no</h3><p> <br/> One simple solution to saying no is, \" our minimum cost or fee to take on a new ideal client is $5000 ( or your number) , are you comfortable with that? If the client says no, then it is not you saying no, it is them. If the client is hesitant, that should tell you that this may not be an ideal client in the future. You can also clarify your professionalism by saying\" in order to help you organize your complete financial life, we will need a list of all of your financial documents\" . Then give them the list. We found that people serious about their finances, will get all of the documents. The ones that have chosen two advisors and keep information confidential from you are not ideal clients, and you should say no to them. It is fine to have two or more advisors, but both advisors should know the total picture. Otherwise what is the financial plan and advice worth? Try telling two surgeons half the story. A second opinion is just that, an opinion.

{"original_id":5218,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Honesty and Transparency – Not Often Associated With the World of Business","link":"honesty-and-transparency-not-often-associated-with-the-world-of-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Honesty and transparency &ndash; two words that warm the cockles of my heart but that are not often associated with the world of business. I am writing this blog having just watched a Hollywood movie about the 2008 banking crisis &ndash; The Big Short, featuring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt is a tough watch &ndash; not because of the quality of the acting, but because of the almost completely unbelievable plot. Sadly, the global economic collapse on which the plot is based was not fiction. It was very real.</p><p> We live in a world where it is difficult to know exactly who we can trust. Since 2008, business related &lsquo;horror stories&rsquo; continue to shock consumers &ndash; from Tesco, to Mitsubishi. From Volkswagen to Npower &ndash; you would have thought that commercial enterprises would have learned something since the days of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. The reality is that there still appears to be a lot to learn.</p><p> There is one phenomenon that is undoubtedly having an effect on the way businesses behave. It is a veritable tidal wave that has been growing since the turn of the millennium. That phenomenon is you and I &ndash; the consumer. Eight years after the economy went into melt down, we are living in societies who crave and demand more openness and transparency. Before we do anything, we want to know the truth first &ndash; or to get as close to the truth as we can. Businesses are fighting this phenomenon, but they may be fighting a losing battle.</p><p> It is impossible to go online these days without seeing some form of &lsquo;customer driven measurement&rsquo;.  From Google reviews, to Trip Advisor, to Trust Pilot &ndash; whether it is a holiday, a smartphone or a designer dress &ndash; the consumer is able to see how others perceive the product or service they are considering &lsquo;investing&rsquo; in. Online forums, Facebook groups and Twitter accounts all add to a melting pot of consumer driven transparency. As a business it makes it significantly more difficult to do anything other than &lsquo;exactly what it says on the tin&rsquo; (so to speak). Deviate from what you are supposed to do and the consumer will not just find out &ndash; they will tell everyone else as well!</p><p> As someone who passionately believes in organisations making money by being consistently brilliant at fulfilling their purpose, ever increasing transparency is a fantastic evolution in the world of Customer Experience. Whilst there will always be some who are cynical of online reviews (as to the genuine nature of them), I think that any form of publicly available measurement can only continue to help put the customer at the heart of business decision making.</p><h3> In my opinion, the more we can see &lsquo;the truth&rsquo; about the businesses we interact with, the better.</h3><p> <br/> One fantastic example of this is in the food and beverage industry. Since 2010, any establishment in the UK serving food has been given a &lsquo;food hygiene rating&rsquo; by their local authority. Essentially, the rating determines how hygienic the establishment is &ndash; rather important if you are selling food. It is not mandatory to display the rating given &ndash; although any consumer can find the rating on the Food  <a href=\"http://ratings.food.gov.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Standards Agency website. </a></p><p> For me, this measurement system is of tremendous benefit to both the company and the customer. Whenever I look to eat in a restaurant I have not visited before, the first thing I always look for is the food hygiene rating. If it is not displayed, not only does that fact make me suspicious, but it will usually lead to me taking my business elsewhere. It is such a powerful way of me being able to make an informed decision based on fact.</p><p> I also love the way that the food hygiene rating system can change the way companies behave. Who would NOT want to have a five (very good) rating? Being able to display the fact that you have been awarded a rating of five drives a focus on doing the right thing &ndash; for your customer and your own people. I know of national restaurant chains who insist on a five rating being absolutely mandatory &ndash; so they should be. If a restaurant manager knows that his performance is not just going to be measured, but also stuck on the front door of the building for all potential customers to see, it does not half have a powerful effect on his actions.</p><p> This public display of &lsquo;standards&rsquo; is not an entirely new concept. Hotels have displayed a &lsquo;star&rsquo; rating for many years. The ratings allocated to any establishment have a fundamental impact on the customer buying decision. With the added weight of customer feedback being left every day on sites such as Trip Advisor, the travel industry is as exposed as any other to the power of measurement for all to see.</p><h3> Imagine a world where this kind of public measurement existed for ALL organisations &ndash; in all industries.</h3><p> <br/> What if your energy company had to display their local authority measured rating system on their website and communication material? What would happen if retailers had to display their ratings on the front door? What if your bank had to display its rating on its mobile app and all other touchpoints in the customer journey?</p><p> This may sound like the mutterings of a mad man, but crazier things have happened. I applaud the authorities for introducing the food hygiene ratings &ndash; I only wish they would make it mandatory to display them publicly across the whole of the UK. I think that the system is the benchmark for other industries to follow. It is not about bureaucracy &ndash; it is about transparency. At least if we all know the &lsquo;score&rsquo;, we can make an informed decision before parting with our hard earned cash. Now that is what I call the transparent Customer Experience!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-16 18:11:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-16 18:11:04.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_n0vRGKm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/honesty-and-transparency-not-often-associated-with-the-world-of-business/\", \"post_id\": \"11108\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-16 18:11:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-16 18:11:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"honesty-and-transparency-not-often-associated-with-the-world-of-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11107\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5434\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Honesty-and-Transparency-Not-Often-Associated-With-the-World-of-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"977\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463479200,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5219,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Asking \"Get to Know You\" Questions Before Investing?","link":"are-you-asking-get-to-know-you-questions-before-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In the world of online dating sites and phone apps, let&rsquo;s face it, appearance matters. First impressions are formed on a handful of photos and limited character count, but anyone who has spent time in the online dating scene knows that the pictures painted by potential suitors don&rsquo;t tell the whole story.</p><p> Choosing investments in your 401(k) or other company plan is a lot like online dating. You are provided with a list of names to choose from, a bit about their heritage (stocks or bonds, domestic or international) and some information about their past (performance).</p><p> Just like with dating, you don&rsquo;t want to rely on an online profile to make this important decision. Ask these &ldquo;get to know you&rdquo; questions about your investment options before making your selections:</p><h3> What&rsquo;s On The Inside?</h3><p> Mutual fund names tell you very little about how they are actually invested. View the prospectus to learn more about the make-up of the fund or ask your financial advisor to take a look for you. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the &ldquo;insides,&rdquo; you could be missing out on opportunities or doubling up on similar funds, providing little diversification.</p><h3> Will It Get Along With Others?</h3><p> Chemistry is important in a partner, but he or she also needs to fare well with other people in your life. The same goes for your investments. If you and your spouse both have retirement plans or investments outside of your company plans, it&rsquo;s important to make sure they all work well together. Perhaps your husband&rsquo;s plan offers the best small-cap fund and yours has a great large-cap fund. Rather than buying sub-par investments in both plans, allocate across plans to get access to only the best fund options.</p><h3> Should I See Other People?</h3><p> Although the goal for dating is to find &ldquo;the one,&rdquo; the goal for investments is to diversify risk through multiple partners. How many investments you choose, and what type, all depend on your target asset allocation. Where you choose to hold the investments will depend on account types and fund options available. <br/> Will I Feel Safe? Depending on your tolerance for risk, racecar driving may be a relationship deal breaker. Risk should also be considered when selecting investments. Don&rsquo;t just rely on the return figures provided online. The fund with the highest return may also be the one with more ups and downs than you can stomach. Ask your financial advisor to review risk measures like standard deviation and sharpe ratio to see if you will feel safe in the relationship.</p><h3> Making Sense</h3><p> Annuity:  A contractual investment, primarily with an insurance company.  The two primary benefits of purchasing an annuity are tax-deferred growth and/or guaranteed income, although they may include a number of optional benefits or &ldquo;riders&rdquo; that are available for an extra charge.  Given their relatively higher fees and long holding (surrender) periods required to maximize benefits, it&rsquo;s important to carefully consider the purchase of an annuity product in light of your current and future needs.         </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 15:06:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 15:06:01.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_WpSNZg2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-asking-get-to-know-you-questions-before-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"11110\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 15:06:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 15:06:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-asking-get-to-know-you-questions-before-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11109\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5435\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Are-You-Asking-Get-to-Know-You-Questions-Before-Investing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"526\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463587200,"author_id":479,"chart_url":""}

Try Embrace These 10 Skills","link":"stumbling-to-be-effective-at-work-and-life-try-embrace-these-10-skills","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It is mind boggling to me people still stumble when it comes to being effective in their work and life. I say this because the ten most valuable life skills are actually choices.</p><p> I couldn&rsquo;t care less what God-given talents you have (or lack). It makes no difference how skilled or educated you are. (It really doesn&rsquo;t and please don&rsquo;t make me go get my statistics about performance and billionaires.)</p><p> When it comes right down to it, most of what makes you successful in life are your choices. Your choices will always trump your circumstances. On we go...</p><h3> 1. Honesty <br/>  </h3><p> This takes no effort whatsoever. Just speak the truth. It&rsquo;s actually harder to lie, tougher to remember what you said, and makes you feel crappy. Ew.</p><h3> 2. Open-Mindedness <br/>  </h3><p> An open mind is a peaceful place. This is a bit tougher than honesty because you&rsquo;ve been fed so many lies in your life you&rsquo;re confused. Try this. Assume everything you think is wrong. You&rsquo;ll be right about half the time if you do that.</p><h3> 3. Sharing <br/>  </h3><p> How easy is this? I&rsquo;m talking ideas, knowledge, toys, or whatever. Be a giver and sharer and the universe will give it back to you in spades. I mean, if you must get it back.</p><h3> 4. Listening <br/>  </h3><p> Listening is a bit different than having an open mind. This one requires you to pay attention so you can hear what&rsquo;s said (or, better yet, felt). Being open-minded means you&rsquo;ll actually do the right thing with what you heard.</p><h3> 5. Smile <br/>  </h3><p> It will make you feel better and make the person you&rsquo;re smiling at feel better. If you&rsquo;re smiling in the mirror, you get a two-fer. Boom. The daily double.</p><h3> 6. Positive attitude <br/>  </h3><p> I think I already mentioned your choices would always trump your circumstances. Maintaining a positive attitude is simply one of those choices, isn&rsquo;t it? (By the way, I&rsquo;m Italian. You have no idea how hard it is for me not to end every sentence with a question. No?)</p><h3> 7. Sit up straight <br/>  </h3><p> Call this one maintaining a positive posture if you&rsquo;d like. This will make you welcoming to others. More importantly, sitting up straight takes a wee bit of energy. Consider this energy part of the motion that feeds emotion that turns into motivation. See how it did that wordplay thing there? (I&rsquo;m still Italian.)</p><h3> 8. Make the extra step <br/>  </h3><p> Just do it&mdash;for everything. If you don&rsquo;t know what the next step is, I have a novel idea for you. Just ask! &ldquo;Hey Mrs. Boss Lady, when I&rsquo;m finished with this task, what would be the next thing you&rsquo;d want me to do?&rdquo; Feel free to memorize that sentence.</p><h3> 9. Research <br/>  </h3><p> This only requires typing. So, choose to type www.google.com. Hit the enter key. The world&rsquo;s information is available and I just got you there in two clicks.</p><h3> 10. Integrity <br/>  </h3><p> I think I called integrity a trait in another article I wrote right after I played poker. Well, it can also be a skill, but it is definitely a choice. You can lump it with honesty if you want, so let&rsquo;s not quibble. I tend to think of honesty as what you say to my face and integrity as what you do behind my back.</p><p> P.S. I did zero minutes of research for this article and I wrote and released it without editing it. It&rsquo;s the very first time I&rsquo;ve ever done that.

The research, such as that conducted by Sophia Bera, founder of Gen Y Planning, supports this notion. Sophia has collected data from her clients that indicates 90% of Millennial clients want an advisor who is within 10 years of their own age.Given this information, it seems that the eventual future of the financial industry lies entirely in the hands of Millennials.</p><h3> What the Industry Looks Like&hellip;</h3>Despite the seeming need for younger financial advisors, recent research from TD Ameritrade &amp; Investment News Research indicates that only 21% of financial advisors are under the age of 40.Additionally, this year roughly 22% of advisors anticipate hiring a NextGen advisor &ndash; though not all of these individuals may actually carry through with this hire.If you want to expand your client base into new demographics, it is important to take on advisors who are similar in age to those clients. This connection facilitates the development of rapport, as the advisor can not only understand the economical context of major life changes, but can also more easily relate to these life changes that the client is going through.As a result, the seeming deficit of Millennial hires is not in your best interest.<h3> How Can Millennials Help?</h3>Beyond the potential to attract new Millennial clients, NextGen employees are a critical agent in forming relationships with the children of your existing clients. Thanks to the relationship you have with their parents, you have an opening to connect with these individuals.At this point, assign your young talent to manage these relationships. Again, ability to relate to their concerns is key. Moreover, the NextGen talent will better understand the social media/technology trends that can be used to leverage other affluent Millennials.<h3> How are NextGens helping?</h3>The TD Ameritrade &amp; Investment News Research study indicates that firms that have already hired NextGens saw their assets increase by an average of 20% annually.<img alt=\"\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Howare-NextGens-helping.png\" width=\"600\"/>Comparing the firms without NextGens and with those with least one such advisor, on average, those &ldquo;NextGen&rdquo; firms have a 20% increase in Income per Owner.Thus, these firms are clearly positioned to grow at a faster rate in the long-term.So, here&rsquo;s the big question: Is yours?","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 15:40:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 15:40:22.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_pQGxbLX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-the-eventual-future-of-the-financial-industry-lies-entirely-in-the-hands-of-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"11117\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 15:40:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 15:40:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-the-eventual-future-of-the-financial-industry-lies-entirely-in-the-hands-of-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11115\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5438\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-the-Eventual-Future-of-the-Financial-Industry-Lies-Entirely-in-the-Hands-of-Millennials.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"544\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463630400,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5223,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Mobile Marketing Any Good in the B2B World?","link":"is-mobile-marketing-any-good-in-the-b2b-world","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Trumpia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sophorn Chhay </a>  | <a href=\"http://trumpia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Trumpia </a> It might&rsquo;ve taken a while, but mobile has finally reached the B2B realm. Cutting-edge strategies are here, and business gurus are handing the latest, greatest smartphone technology schemes to impact vendor relationships. Mobile marketing is versatile, and this year&rsquo;s pros are implementing highly flexible strategies to deeply impact fertile environments. Mobile penetration has reached record heights, and B2Cs are getting experimental. Below, we cover the ways your mobile marketing strategy can adapt to the B2B world, one point at a time:</p><h3> Strategy One: Using Financial Text Alerts</h3>It&rsquo;s taken a while for financial text alerts to kick off, but business providers are beginning to accept them for vender relations. SMS is the world&rsquo;s most immediate marketing channel. Within 15 minutes of sending a message,<a href=\"https://blog.trumpia.com/blog/mobile-text-alert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 97 percent of your recipients will have read it</a>. Marketing channels extending across several B2B providers needn&rsquo;t be lagged by email. They deserve quick, responsive services. Financial text alerts can keep statements in line while covering possible deals. Assuming your business is trusted, financial text alerts can be a solid B2B cornerstone.<h3> Strategy Two: Focusing on Mobile E-Commerce</h3>Once a holy grounds for B2C traffic, mobile e-commerce platforms will soon host B2B buyers as a majority. In fact,<a href=\"http://www.cmo.com/articles/2014/8/11/b2b_mobile_marketing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 56 percent of B2B customers</a>read reviews on mobile. 50 percent compare prices and features. By implementing a solid mobile e-commerce strategy, you can fortify overall B2B digital sales. Mobile remains one of the most flexible platforms for vendors, so don&rsquo;t give it up yet.<h3> Strategy Three: Noting Google&rsquo;s Algorithm Shift</h3>Google&rsquo;s algorithm shift will usher in a new age of quality mobile web content. This year,<a href=\"http://www.inboundo.co/business/cold-hard-marketing-stats-drive-next-marketing-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 78 percent of marketers</a>are aware of the shift. 38.2 percent of these marketers feel their mobile web presence rankings will be impacted. What&rsquo;s the gist? Heightened versatility will win. In fact, big-name providers are rolling out mobile-first platforms to supplement their adoption of new content plans. Really, a flexible mobile marketing plan is needed in the B2B world. There&rsquo;s no other way around it.<h3> Strategy Four: Automating Your SMS Send-Outs</h3>Unlike consumers, B2B venders are apt to take part in SMS platforms with reliable patterns. You&rsquo;ll know when a buyer is interested, and you&rsquo;ll know when they&rsquo;re not. For this reason, intuitive<a href=\"http://textpedite.com/blog/customer-rewards-program/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> providers like Textpedite</a>have worked on incredibly powerful automated SMS systems. By automatically capturing a vender&rsquo;s data upon keyword entry, you can gage their behavior. By gaging their behavior, you can better engage them. In the B2B world, you need to make sure your message is heard. Don&rsquo;t wait, and grow your B2B list before 2016 ends.<h3> Strategy Five: Implement a Mobile App</h3>83 percent of today&rsquo;s B2B marketers consider mobile apps to be an integral part of content marketing. The industry agrees, too, as entire marketing strategies have evolved to revolve around user-friendly features, content-friendly options and business-friendly deals. By launching a B2B mobile app, you can ensure maximum visibility while keeping your brand&rsquo;s feet on the ground. Much of B2B communication requires constant outreach and utility. Why make a potential vender browse for your offers on Facebook? Give them a reason to return to your app, and take advantage of its incredible cross-platform options.In the mobile marketing world, few tools are as versatile as a constant-use mobile app. It&rsquo;s the center hub of alerts, SMS launches, e-commerce portals and special deals. Mobile marketing is incredibly flexible, and it won&rsquo;t stop impacting the B2B world. Are you ready?<h3> What's Next?</h3>How do you ensure that your customer is getting the best mobile experience possible when interacting with your brand?

Unfortunately, like it so often happens in the recruiting process, we were sold a situation that was more wishful thinking than reality.</p><p> Charged with implementing a new innovation center, I had financial resources, but not a team, to spearhead our change initiative. Not ideal. Change was and is my favorite challenge yet, without an in-house team, I was nervous (to put it mildly).</p><p> When I heard him speak at a conference, I knew we needed him. Experienced, confident and creative, he shared his story of successful large-scale change. He was also regularly published by one of my favorite magazines that rhymes with Ast Umpany. After his speech, I got in line and waited my turn.</p><p> We talked, swapped cards and I texted my boss: I found the guy.</p><p> My boss was excited but reminded me that we needed to compete the work.</p><p> Since I spent the first 11 years of my career in Change Management and HR with Accenture, I reached out to them for a proposal and PWC too. Always a strong believer in small business expertise and solo practitioners, I included two small biz on the slate, including the speaker.</p><p> I followed &ldquo;my guy&rdquo; on Twitter, and we started talking more in-depth about the work so he could send me a strong proposal. Every time we spoke, he sold himself hard, but I was already on board. I just needed the proposal in hand and to submit it to purchasing for them to lead the competition process.</p><p> Unfortunately, the more we talked and the more closely I followed him on Twitter, the less I liked him.</p><p> When I finally got his proposal as a solo-practitioner advisor, the tens of thousands he put in there were hard to swallow. What and who was I buying? What happened to the sparkle from his speech?</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be my speaker guy. Avoid these pitfalls of coaches and consultants who want to build thriving practices but are consistently losing potential clients and falling short of their goals.</p><h3> 5 Big Reasons You&rsquo;re Losing Potential Clients <br/>  </h3><h3> #1: Everything&rsquo;s All About You <br/>  </h3><p> On Twitter, my guy&rsquo;s tweets all started something like this: &ldquo;Read my new article&rdquo; or &ldquo;My thoughts on&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smart and fabulous, and you should care what I have to say&hellip;&rdquo; (Okay, he didn&rsquo;t really write that last one.)</p><p> Social&rsquo;s NOT all about you.</p><p> Not one retweet. Not one interaction or conversation. Not one share that wasn&rsquo;t his article, his thoughts, all about him. It stopped looking smart and impressive and moved into big ego territory. This guy was a know-it-all. </p><p> The thing is, the more I read his tweets, they did reflect his attitude and personality. This guy&rsquo;s ego ran the show.</p><p> Social media has given coaches and consultants access not only to a &ldquo;free marketing channel&rdquo; and potential clients on a global scale but also to a whole new space for relationship building.</p><h3> #2: You Talk About Your One Big Win Over and Over and Over <br/>  </h3><p> His stories sparkled from the podium at my conference. Later I discovered that his story of success was his only story of success. In his writing, speaking, tweeting it was all the same gig. Oh, and he wasn&rsquo;t an outside consultant or coach, he was an employee leading a large initiative &ndash; a very different dynamic.</p><p> Yes, it was impressive but come on, who&rsquo;s going to hire you because you did something once?</p><p> One dimensional stories fall flat.</p><p> How did you take those experiences and apply them to new people and organizations? Now that&rsquo;s interesting to your potential clients.</p><h3> #3: Nickel-and-Dime is Your MO <br/>  </h3><p> He saw corporate, he saw deep pockets, he charged $40K+ for advisory hours. He would be my advisor. Two full days to knock out the plan and a few regularly set hours over six months. If I needed more time or struggled to implement between meetings, I could pay to touch base.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the thing, I&rsquo;m a coach and consultant too. I understand charging for our time but when you&rsquo;re asking your customer to pay outrageous dollars, take their calls. If things fall apart because you can&rsquo;t touch base for 30 minutes, their $40K investment in you goes to hell. Will not look good. Trust me.</p><p> Oh, if I wanted him to type something up or create&hellip; I&rsquo;d have to sell my kidney before getting the additional budget from my company.</p><p> Seek to add value to your client and your relationship, not only add value to your bank account.</p><h3> #4: You Dismiss Your Client&rsquo;s Experience <br/>  </h3><p> I worked in change management for a very long time. Still, I wanted to hire an advisor for two reasons: 1) I was stressed without a dedicated internal change team, 2) I wanted new thinking to merge with my knowledge and experience.</p><p> It turned out my guy didn&rsquo;t give a s*!t about my experience.</p><p> He didn&rsquo;t want to be my partner or even advisor; he wanted to be my&hellip; boss. He knew how to do his thing, and his thing was the best solution. Period. End of story.</p><h3> #5: Push Your Smart Solution with Trust Me and a Wink <br/>  </h3><p> He said he was listening to me when I discussed our business challenges but his responses were generic. It was all about his smart solution instead of demonstrating to me that he heard me and understood our needs.</p><p> It seemed he cared more about landing a client than solving our problem.</p><p> &ldquo;When we have our two-day offsite, I&rsquo;ll go into details about how to implement but it&rsquo;s going to do exactly what you need.&rdquo;</p><p> I understand keeping the ingredients to your secret sauce under wraps but for goodness sake, help me understand why it&rsquo;s a good fit. Demonstrate that you have a grasp of our situation and if you&rsquo;re going to push your solution, why it&rsquo;s the perfect solution to take away our pain.</p><p> His swagger meant that he didn&rsquo;t have to share. He was that good (or so he thought.)</p><p> All of this made it hard to chose the solo practitioner over the big consulting firm. Yes, they were two completely different levels of support and very different price points too. However, I was worried I&rsquo;d get lost as Accenture or PWC led the charge. I wanted a partner &ndash; he just wasn&rsquo;t the one.</p><p> Now that I am no longer working in corporate and have my own business, these lessons still come into play. Losing potential clients because I&rsquo;m self-centered and a poor listener is not acceptable. I&rsquo;m willing to be that it&rsquo;s not acceptable to you either.</p><h3> If you want to create a business that thrives, ask yourself:</h3><li> Am I treating my potential customers like a number or like a future partner?</li><li> Am I listening or doing all the speaking?</li><li> How can I help?</li><li> What do they need to be successful?</li><li> Am I the right person?</li><li> How far am I willing to go in service of my client&rsquo;s success?</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 16:16:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 16:16:41.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_NXQMPAw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-big-reasons-youre-losing-potential-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"11121\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 16:16:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 16:16:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-big-reasons-youre-losing-potential-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11120\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5440\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5-Big-Reasons-You\\u2019re-Losing-Potential-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"763\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463558400,"author_id":15,"chart_url":""}

What happens when your clients are happy, but you&rsquo;re questioning whether you&rsquo;re in the right place to best serve both your needs and theirs? How do you even contemplate replacing your current business card with a new one?</p><p> The changing regulatory environment, coupled by firm consolidation, has made the financial advisory business more complicated than ever, leaving many advisors frustrated and questioning whether they have a future at their current firm. Frustrations among advisors vary, with some rooted in the day-to-day while others go a bit deeper and pose a conflict to the advisor&rsquo;s core philosophy. And while that variance causes a range of discontent among advisors, their own responsible efforts with their clients mask their frustrations.</p><p> So, while you&rsquo;re helping your clients reach their dreams, is there a cost to sacrificing your own personal happiness and, could that inevitably impact your ability to serve clients and grow your business? </p><p> Living a life that is congruent with your values and beliefs creates a state of integrity and a sense of harmony. In fact, there&rsquo;s often a feeling of intrinsic trust that comes from someone who&rsquo;s acting in accordance with who they are and what they believe in. Trust, technical competence, experience and knowledge are the foundation for the advisor-client relationship and given financial services has morphed from an industry driven by product to one defined by advice, client satisfaction likely has more to do with the advisor than the firm he or she works for.</p><p> Then, what happens when an advisor feels that their firm&rsquo;s policies are not congruent with their core values and beliefs? Can that feeling of incongruence and discontent trickle down to the client and, what&rsquo;s the overall impact on the business?</p><p> In our experience, advisors are masterful when it comes to insulating their clients from their frustrations, and while many of the minor annoyances that plague them on a daily basis may not directly impact their clients, maintaining the status quo requires an enormous amount of energy and impacts overall productivity. If your values clash with those of your firm, the authenticity of the message that you&rsquo;re delivering to clients and prospects will likely be diminished.</p><p> Unfortunately, many people live a life that is not congruent with who they are and what they believe because they fear the consequences that may result from making a change. Staying the course is indeed the path of least resistance and will require adjusting one&rsquo;s expectations and attitude. You can accept the frustrations and continue to grow the business in spite of them. On the other hand, some advisors may opt to reclaim their place in the driver&rsquo;s seat and will find the courage to tell clients that while they have been happy, you have not been and it is your belief that they would be better served by you taking their business elsewhere.</p><p> Operating consistently from a trusted position with your clients often results in a relationship where that trust is returned. Rely on the trust that your clients have in you and &ndash; provided that you are acting from a place of truth, integrity and a sense of what&rsquo;s right &ndash; you&rsquo;re likely to chart a path that is accretive to both you and your clients; one in which everyone&rsquo;s happy in the end.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 16:30:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 16:30:55.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Us4Q7i4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-sacrificing-your-own-personal-happiness-to-help-clients-reach-their-dreams/\", \"post_id\": \"11123\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 16:30:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 16:30:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-sacrificing-your-own-personal-happiness-to-help-clients-reach-their-dreams\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11122\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5441\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Are-You-Sacrificing-Your-Own-Personal-Happiness-to-Help-Clients-Reach-Their-Dreams.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"779\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463565600,"author_id":133,"chart_url":""}

Will your lifestyle remain unchanged no matter which option you choose?</p><p> Or are you an owner who enjoys financial security only if you stay in your business? If you sell, will you sacrifice the lifestyle you enjoy today because your post-exit income stream will be dramatically less? The answer is critical.</p><p> If you are in the first camp, you could sell the business or you could decide not to.</p><p> If you are in the second camp, there is more money to be made in keeping the business than in selling it.</p><p> These questions are all resolved by answering one more:</p><p> Can you replace your current compensation with the investment income from sale proceeds and existing investments?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at how one owner made the determination.</p><p> Larry started his building materials distribution company 25 years ago. Today, his salary is $200,000 per year and the company has $500,000 to $750,000 of pre-tax earnings (EBITDA).</p><p> Like many Boomers, Larry is thinking about life without the business. He isn&rsquo;t burned out, but the entrepreneurial flame burns less intensely than it did in the early years.  He knows if he continues to devote less than full effort to running the company, the business will suffer and he will be no closer to making a decision. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he thinks, &ldquo;if I can live the way I want to, it is time to sell.&rdquo;</p><p> Larry&rsquo;s desire to live, after his exit, as he lives today strikes a chord with most owners. Few of us will exit willingly if it means sacrificing our current lifestyle.</p><p> Larry&rsquo;s first step was to meet with a financial planner. Like many owners Larry had assumed that it took his salary ($200,000) to maintain the lifestyle that he and his wife enjoyed. He was surprised to learn that he and his wife required 50 percent more, or $300,000 per year. The Dykes&rsquo; additional spending of $100,000 per year had been fueled by &ldquo;perks&rdquo; and S distributions.</p><p> Step two was to calculate whether the Dykes could maintain their current lifestyle if they: 1) sold their business and 2) added the net proceeds to their existing investments (which totaled $1,000,000).</p><p> A business broker estimated a likely sale price for Larry&rsquo;s business of $2,500,000 resulting in net proceeds of $1,800,000 (after taxes and selling costs). With $2,800,000 of investable assets, Larry&rsquo;s financial planner recommended using a 4 percent withdrawal rate, or about $110,000 a year. With that and Social Security payments, the Dykes could expect income of $150,000 per year&mdash;half of what they were used to. As for the extra $500,000-$750,000 of pre-tax earnings (EBITDA)? Those would go to the new owner.</p><p> Unless they halved their lifestyle, Larry realized he had two choices if they sold today: slash their lifestyle by half or maintain their lifestyle but eventually end up in a trailer park. They weren&rsquo;t willing to do either.</p><h3> Lesson #1 <br/>  </h3><p> Unless your business currently provides a satisfactory lifestyle AND produces significant excess cash flow&mdash;EBITDA&mdash;it is unlikely that a buyer will want it.  If it does attract a buyer, the proceeds from that sale will likely be far below what you need to replace your current income, let alone replace the excess cash flow that your company produces. You need to work with your financial planner and a valuation (or M&amp;A) advisor to determine this. Relying on your own financial and value assumptions will likely send you straight to that trailer park!</p><h3> Lesson #2 <br/>  </h3><p> Owners seeking to achieve financial security through the sale of their businesses are seldom successful unless they already enjoy financial security through business ownership.</p><h3> Lesson #3 <br/>  </h3><p> Only owners who can sell their companies for enough cash to maintain their lifestyles even have a choice to sell or stay. Larry and most owners with businesses worth less than $5,000,000 or so do not have that choice. If they choose to sell, they also choose a lower lifestyle than they currently enjoy.</p><p> Once you know, with certitude, which owner camp is yours, you can begin the process of creating and executing a strategy to create more business value and cash flow while simultaneously re-examining your role and day-to-day involvement in your company.</p><p> In future posts we will discuss the connection between strengthening a company and reducing your involvement. This is what &ldquo;successful owners who can sell their business for the money they need, but decide not to&rdquo; have achieved.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 16:44:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 16:44:54.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_vSAmhh6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/should-i-sell-my-business-three-lessons-to-be-learned/\", \"post_id\": \"11125\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 16:44:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 16:44:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"should-i-sell-my-business-three-lessons-to-be-learned\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11124\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5442\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Should-I-Sell-My-Business-Three-Lessons-to-be-Learned.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"549\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463562000,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Opposites definitely attract, and one spouse&rsquo;s idea of living is the other&rsquo;s idea of lavishing. A lifelong partnership requires trust and respect. That means you each need to recognize you bring different styles of managing money to the marriage, and both will need to bend to prevent money.</p><h3> Here are some tips to help immediately stabilize your situation: <br/>  </h3><li> Recognize money is the necessary tool that can power your lifestyle now, and in the future.</li><li> Write down your goals separately. Then together share and combine the vision. It&rsquo;s important that you do this in writing.</li><li> Talk through the strategies that will allow you to enjoy those goals.</li><li> Acknowledge some degree of independence is healthy. Set up separate bank or brokerage accounts so you have: your&rsquo;s, mine and our&rsquo;s accounts. Agree to funding an emergency savings cushion and define &lsquo;emergencies&rsquo;.</li><li> You&rsquo;re a team now. If your spouse is overusing credit cards, you&rsquo;ll need to stick to using a debit card and agree to restrict the amount of available credit.</li><li> Stay focused on investing for the future.

This way, you keep your eyes on the prize instead of holding grudges over past mistakes. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s not easy managing and investing your own money, and it&rsquo;s twice as challenging when you&rsquo;re trying to blend two completely different styles.

During one period, you work on your endurance. During another, you work on your sprinting, and of course, you have to build in downtime to recover! It's not the hard training that makes you faster; it's the hard training followed by rest and recovery!&rdquo;</p><p> And how does that concept translate to business? Well, &ldquo;hard training&rdquo; can mean taking on new clients or pushing toward quarterly goals. But in between are times &ldquo;where things are much calmer &mdash; where instead of focusing on growth, we're focused on training and development and creating new ways to deliver more value to our clients. A lot of new employees, those not use to the rhythms of the business, mistakenly believe that the busy times will never end. Rest does come, and after a brief recovery, most employees go through a period of adaptation where the next busy stretch doesn't feel nearly as overwhelming.&rdquo;</p><p> So treat challenges as a time to build company strength &mdash; not a race where you drain employees dry and then immediately move on to the next sprint. And make sure your employees know how to use the rhythms of the business to keep themselves &ldquo;in shape.&rdquo;</p><h3> Work Hard, Eat Hard, Play Hard</h3><p> Rich Kahn, Founder and CEO of eZanga.com, also makes good use of downtime. &ldquo;Our motto here is Work Hard, Eat Hard, Play Hard!&rdquo; he tells us. &ldquo;When it comes to having fun at work, we like to coordinate an outing every month to help our employees let loose and have fun at work. In fact, we're taking the office to go bowling next week. In the past, we've taken trips to Hershey Park and celebrated Christmas in July in Atlantic City.&rdquo;</p><p> And why does Kahn think this is important? &ldquo;You spend more time at work than at home with your family, and that's why we believe it's important to get our employees away from the cubicle and out into the world to have some fun!&rdquo;</p><p> The company also boost employee morale with daily catered lunches, birthdays and government holidays off, and a commitment to respecting employees&rsquo; personal time. The result? Well-rested (and well-fed) workers who have the energy to tackle the tough stuff.</p><h3> Giving Them a Vision</h3><p> Speaker and author Barry Maher explains, &ldquo;We all know our people can achieve more than they believe they can achieve. So show them that. Show them the vision you have for what they can become and what they can accomplish: a vision you may have helped to instill but one you've worked out with them so it encompasses their hopes and dreams. If they think you have a high opinion of them, it's amazing what they will do to maintain that opinion. And the more they respect you, the harder they will work to hang on to your regard.</p><p> &ldquo;And show them the vision you have for the business, a business they&rsquo;re a valuable part of. More important, show them how your vision for the business can help them get wherever they want to go.</p><p> &ldquo;You want to motivate people and keep them from burning out, show them how your vision the business can help their dreams come true. Nothing is more powerful.&rdquo;</p><p> Anyone can feel discouraged when it just feels like they&rsquo;re slogging through pointless hard work. But a goal to inspire them can make the difference between staying engaged and burning out.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 17:09:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 17:09:00.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_kYG6LUN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/strategies-to-keep-employees-afloat-when-stress-levels-rise/\", \"post_id\": \"11129\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 17:09:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 17:09:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"strategies-to-keep-employees-afloat-when-stress-levels-rise\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11128\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5444\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Strategies-to-Keep-Employees-Afloat-When-Stress-Levels-Rise.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463590800,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5229,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Remote Employees: 5 Ways to Overcome Overlooked Challenges","link":"remote-employees-5-ways-to-overcome-overlooked-challenges","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Not everyone you work with and supervise will always be in the same building, state, region or time zone as you.</p><p> We assume remote employees can and should be handled the same as local employees. When problems with communication and productivity occur, we are quick to blame the distance for the issue. Employees blame management for the lack of clarity and direction. Managers blame employees for poor results and low accountability.</p><p> Both are right &hellip; and both are wrong. </p><p> Managing employees remotely presents unique challenges that are often overlooked. The lack of social interaction, the reliance on written communication, the importance of trust and the need for regular results measurement are more prevalent in remote work where interaction is not as routine or easy and effort is not as easily observed. Both managers and employees are ill-equipped for how to cope with this. Frustrated, the employee lessens effort and considers leaving the organization while the manager considers ways to bring the work back to common ground where controlling message and outcomes is easier.</p><p> Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t always possible or practical. Both parties have to work thru the challenges to improve the relationship and the results.</p><p> And, as always, the manager has to lead these efforts.</p><p> Here are 5 ways to turn the tide on the challenges of managing remote employees:</p><h3> 1. Be clear</h3><p> Managers should always seek to create and maintain clarity on roles, duties and expectations of the people who report to them. With remote employees, this is even more important. Making sure your remote employees know what is expected of them and how they will be measured will go a long way in overcoming obstacles. There can be no confusion on these things if trust is going to be established and the seeds for a productive work relationship planted.</p><h3> 2. Talk often</h3><p> Create regular time for conversation with your remote employees. Put it on the schedule and stick to it. Treat appointments with your remote employees with the same level of importance as your C-suite and top vendor partners. As often as possible, visit them in person &mdash; and definitely use video to bridge the space gap. Voices over phone and words over email are far more easily misinterpreted than when you can see the other person. Contact should be frequent at first and slowly decrease over time &mdash; but never less than once a month.</p><h3> 3. Show interest</h3><p> The great thing about sharing physical space is getting to know the interests and idiosyncrasies of other people. You learn the shows people like and the music they listen to. You learn if they must have a cup of coffee before being able to form a coherent thought and if they are no good without their 3pm snack. You often won&rsquo;t learn these things about your remote employees unless you ask. SO ASK!! Learn about them. Show interest in and respect for the things they like.</p><h3> 4. Never forget</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t overlook your remote employees in your efforts toward training, development and promotion. Just because you don&rsquo;t see them everyday and cannot easily manage them doesn&rsquo;t mean it is okay to overlook them. Don&rsquo;t just leave your remote employees out there doing menial, administrative tasks that don&rsquo;t add real value or drive results. Put effort into developing them for more opportunity if they show interest.</p><h3> 5. Lighten up</h3><p> Take time to talk about things and in ways that aren&rsquo;t always serious and official. Use emojis, memes and gifs to have a little fun with your email responses when possible. Once you learn about their interests, share articles you find or check in with them after an OMG moment on their favorite show or let them know if you see a good deal on tickets to see their favorite band. Send them an unexpected knick knack or souvenir. Be personable without going overboard.</p><p> It is not easy to work away from your boss or from your employees. It takes a lot to cultivate and maintain those relationships. But it is possible with a little extra effort to make meaningful, lasting relationships with remote employees just like you have with the people just outside your door.</p><p> Try it. Let me know how it works for you!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 17:21:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 17:21:01.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_ql0vAJ0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/remote-employees-5-ways-to-overcome-overlooked-challenges/\", \"post_id\": \"11133\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 17:21:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 17:21:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"remote-employees-5-ways-to-overcome-overlooked-challenges\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11132\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5446\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Remote-Employees-5-Ways-to-Overcome-Overlooked-Challenges.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"666\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463594400,"author_id":427,"chart_url":""}

It was an intense experience to walk the halls where I once studied and explored and dreamed toward the future I imagined ahead of me.</p><h3> &ldquo;What does success look like?&rdquo; one of the bright-eyed ones asked.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;How did you get from sitting where we are, to where you are now? How did you go from student to eventual author, director, producer?&rdquo;</p><p> Her unspoken question also hung in the air, &ldquo;How did you accomplish this&hellip; as a woman?&rdquo;</p><p> Her unexpressed doubt hung there equally, &ldquo;And if you did, then could I possibly do so too?&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been chewing on that ever since. This idea that success is something to be measured and quantified against preconceived goals. Because that&rsquo;s how we all start out&hellip; If I make this much money, or achieve that title, or have this type of wedding, or drive that type of car&hellip; thenI will have achieved success. I will be somebody. But who will you be with those things? Whom do those things make you?</p><p> The eager young woman asking those questions wanted very much to admire me as &ldquo;a success&rdquo;. It was oozing from her, palpable. She needed me to be someone she could emulate, hoping perhaps that my formulas for choice and decision-making could become hers, and in the following of them she would achieve her own &ldquo;success&rdquo;.</p><p> I told the auditorium filled with students that success looks a lot less like a direct trajectory, and a lot more like a plate of spaghetti. Twists and turns and tunnels, and limp noodles tied into knots&hellip;</p><p> That&rsquo;s all true. Success is rarely achieved in a direct line. Anything valuable most often arrives hand in hand with an unenviable dose of heartache, failures, humiliations, and lessons badly learned. You must walk a few laps with Job, or many&hellip;</p><p> But as I&rsquo;ve pondered since, I wish I had answered her question differently.</p><p> I wish I had told her she had it upside down. Diving into what is success and what's not.</p><p> I wish I had said success has very little to do with things like becoming a director or producer.</p><p> Or being on TV.</p><p> Or working with uber cool clients.</p><p> Or publishing a book.</p><p> Or going back and speaking at your alma mater.</p><p> Those things are fun. They look good on a resume. They complete a digital portfolio nicely.</p><p> But they are not success.</p><p> Success is&hellip;</p><li> going to sleep with a clean conscience at night.</li><li> seeing your child choose the Jesus-thing, instead of the world-thing, and then come dashing over joyfully to share it with you.</li><li> confronting injustice and being an active part of resolution for the oppressed.</li><li> living in harmony with those you love most.</li><li> doing something kind to someone who has absolutely nothing to offer you in return.</li><li> knowing that even in the face of great pain or loss, you have clung to your core values without flinching.</li><li> finishing the day&rsquo;s to-do list and knowing it was accomplished with a measure of excellence, no matter how trivial the content.</li><li> being vulnerable enough to embrace honesty when you knew you were wrong, and allowing a friend to put you in your place without hating them for doing so.</li><li> deciding to do that really hard thing, because it&rsquo;s right, instead of the fun or easy or comfortable thing that is gonna nag your conscience. <br/>  </li><p> Success. has. absolutely. nothing. to. do. with. occupation. <br/> Or accomplishment. <br/> Or prestige. <br/> Or fame.</p><p> Success is a matter of the heart. </p><p> That is what I wish I had said.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 17:24:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 17:24:44.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_koD4RRt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-best-define-success-and-its-not-accomplishment-prestige-or-fame/\", \"post_id\": \"11135\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 17:24:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 17:24:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-best-define-success-and-its-not-accomplishment-prestige-or-fame\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11136\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5447\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Should-I-Sell-My-Business-Three-Lessons-to-be-Learned_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"843\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463598000,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}

What does that mean for you?</p><p> It means that sales hiring, where decisions have always been dubiously based on &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; and &ldquo;gut-feel,&rdquo; is stepping up to the big-data plate and looking for a home run.</p><p> Remember the movie Moneyball? Brad Pitt, general manager of the Oakland A's outsmarts the richer ball clubs using data science, effectively building the dream team based on analytics alone. It&rsquo;s time to Moneyball your sales team.</p><p> With more data than ever before, we are able to assess salespeople with shocking accuracy and evaluate traits we would have never been able to before. </p><p> Case in point: Work ethic. The ability to assess work ethic can change your team forever. This is how to do it.</p><h3> What Is Work Ethic Anyways?</h3><p> First, let&rsquo;s define work ethic. A somewhat soft term, &ldquo;work ethic&rdquo; is a personality domain associated with hard work and diligence. This domain is very closely related to and can be used in place of the personality trait, \"conscientiousness.\"</p><h3> What Is Conscientiousness Anyways?</h3><p> Conscientiousness is one of the Big Five personality traits. Conscientiousness is then divided into two subdomains: achievement drive and dependability.</p><p> Both of these subdomains are beneficial values to have when looking to hire. However, the research shows us that achievement drive tends to relate to work ethic more than dependability.</p><p> In summary:</p><p> Work Ethic = Conscientiousness. Conscientiousness = Achievement Drive + Dependability. (Primarily Achievement Drive).</p><h3> A Look at the Data</h3><p> Professors Vinchur and colleagues recently did some research and found that people's self-ratings of their Achievement Drive compare:</p><li> .25 with supervisor ratings of sales performance</li><li> .41 with objective sales outcomes (e.g., sales revenue)</li><p> Here are two tables examining how Big Five personality traits factor into sales hiring success.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Table-1.png\" width=\"426\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Table-2.png\" width=\"450\"/></p><p> Ji-A Min, Ideal&rsquo;s Head Data Scientist Explains, &ldquo;These statistics show that work ethic explains approximately 6% of the variance among salespeople as measured by supervisor ratings and approximately 17% of the variance in performance among salespeople as measured by objective sales outcomes.&rdquo;</p><h3> In Plain English</h3><p> Basically, these results show that both candidates and supervisors can determine a variance in sales performance by assessing achievement drive.</p><h3> Measuring Achievement Drive</h3><p> Achievement drive in a job candidate is best measured through a psychometric assessment.</p><p> Psychometric testing is the process of measuring a candidate's strengths and weaknesses based on their self-reported assessments answers. An assessment of this nature allows recruiters and employers to predict, based on objective data, which candidates will be most suitable for a certain role.</p><p> The data speaks for itself on measuring work ethic and demonstrates that if you want the best sales people for your role, you need to make sure you know what to measure and how to measure it properly. One without the other will not do.</p><p> By measuring these domains objectively, you can actually determine which candidate is statistically more likely to thrive in your organization.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-17 17:31:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-17 17:31:18.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_hVr6HaD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-figure-out-a-persons-work-ethic-before-you-hire-them/\", \"post_id\": \"11140\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-17 17:31:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-17 17:31:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-figure-out-a-persons-work-ethic-before-you-hire-them\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11137\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5448\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Figure-out-a-Persons-Work-Ethic-Before-You-Hire-Them.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"972\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463562000,"author_id":267,"chart_url":""}

Do your team members:</p><li> Share with each other what, from their experiences, works best in given situations?</li><li> Share with each other what solutions they have come up with?</li><li> Share their mistakes with others and what they learned from them?</li><li> Share their ideas/experiences on how to improve operations and/or your customer&rsquo;s experiences? <br/>  </li><p> Teams who communicate with each other regularly are better than those who don&rsquo;t.

Gladstone was the more educated and intellectual of the two; Disraeli more street-smart and intuitive.</p><p> When asked to compare the two, she said: &ldquo;After my dinner with Mr. Gladstone, I felt he was the cleverest man in all of England. After my dinner with Mr. Disraeli,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I felt as though I were the cleverest woman in all of England.&rdquo;</p><p> Listening is probably the most underrated and overrated skill in business. It&rsquo;s underrated because we don&rsquo;t always appreciate just how powerful and positive deep, empathetic listening can be in our relationships. It&rsquo;s overrated in the sense that many of us think we&rsquo;re good listeners, but we&rsquo;re not.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at 10 listening pitfalls&mdash;10 common mistakes people make that can have disastrous consequences. </p><h3> 1. Insincere listening</h3><p> This is when you pay lip service to the other person&rsquo;s ideas. You have to be genuinely interested in your client and what he or she is talking about.</p><h3> 2. Thinking ahead</h3><p> Our minds often race ahead to the next question or issue while the person we&rsquo;re with is still talking. The result? We don&rsquo;t really listen to what they are saying.</p><h3> 3. Believing you&rsquo;re the smartest person in the room.</h3><p> We tend to forget that it&rsquo;s not always about being right or having the perfect idea but rather helping a client make changes that will improve their business.</p><h3> 4. Being in love with your own ideas</h3><p> After spending weeks or months analyzing the problem, it&rsquo;s easy to become enamored with the conclusions you&rsquo;re trying to present&mdash;as opposed to creating a give-and-take with the client as you socialize and test your ideas.</p><h3> 5. Being overly-focused on your own agenda.</h3><p> It&rsquo;s about your client&rsquo;s agenda, not yours. Try going into your next meeting, and instead of saying, &ldquo;We have three points to cover with you,&rdquo; ask, &ldquo;From your perspective, what&rsquo;s the most valuable way to spend our time this morning? Which of these agenda items are most critical for you?&rdquo;</p><h3> 6. Listening without giving back</h3><p> Good listening is about mutual disclosure, not just sitting there and taking notes. The conversation has to be interspersed with your own thoughts, feelings, ideas, and experiences.</p><h3> 7. Not affirming</h3><p> Affirmation is a powerful reinforcement for the person speaking. If you just listen and never say anything, the speaker may feel stranded. Paraphrase and synthesize as you go along. Affirm that you&rsquo;ve understood your client.</p><h3> 8. Being distracted or rushed</h3><p> All of your body language has to reinforce that this is the most important conversation happening in the world today.</p><h3> 9. Indulging your biases</h3><p> We all have biases, and even prejudices, which inhibit our ability to listen. Some studies have shown, for example, that doctors give inferior care to certain minority groups. Why? Most likely because their unconscious biases prevent them from taking these patients as seriously as they should. Over the entrance to the ancient Greek temple of Delphi, where the oracle lived, was written, &ldquo;Know thyself.&rdquo; Well, to listen well you DO have to have strong self knowledge.</p><h3> 10.

{"original_id":5234,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Understanding Grief: How to Help Clients Who “Chase After Closure\"","link":"understanding-grief-how-to-help-clients-who-chase-after-closure","source_link":null,"content":"<p><strong>When your clients experience a loved one&rsquo;s death, they often seek &ldquo;closure.&rdquo; Yet no one really defines what closure means, whether it is possible, or how to get there.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By understanding a few things about the grief process, you can equip yourself to help them find peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many in our society, closure means leaving grief behind, a milestone they usually expect within a matter of weeks or months. Closure means being &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, getting back to your old self, no longer crying or being affected by the death. It means &ldquo;moving on with life&rdquo; and leaving the past behind, even to the extent of forgetting it or ignoring it. Yet for those who have experienced death, this kind of closure is not only impossible but indeed undesirable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closure, if one even chooses to use the term, is more of a process than a defined moment. The initial part of closure is accepting the reality. At first, survivors keep hoping or wishing that it weren&rsquo;t true. They expect their loved one to walk through the door. They wait for someone to tell them it was all a huge mistake. They just can&rsquo;t accept that this person has died, that they will never physically see their loved one again or hear the voice, feel the hug, or get that valued input on a tough decision. Usually it takes weeks or even months for the reality to finally sink in. In time, they come to know, in both their heads and their hearts, that their loved one has died and is not coming back. They still don&rsquo;t like it, but they accept it as true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As your clients accept this reality, they can more actively make forward-looking choices that help them heal. They slowly begin to envision a life different from what they had planned before, a life in which they no longer expect their loved one to be there. They still feel the pain and loss, but except for short periods of time, they are not crippled by it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most of your clients, especially if it was a significant person who died, this healing phase is long and slow, and it involves a lot of back-and-forthing. They may alternate between tears and joy, fears and confidence, despair and hope. Sometimes they feel like they are taking three steps forward and two steps back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to give clients permission for whatever they are experiencing. Everyone else is telling them to put it behind them and get on with life. Set yourself apart by encouraging them to tell the stories and build memories that they will never &ldquo;put behind them&rdquo;. Reassure them that healing does not mean forgetting; it means taking the life, love, and lessons into the future with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually your clients are able to let go of what can no longer be. Yet at the same time they realize they are taking the past, with all its pain and pleasure, into a new tomorrow. They become different and hopefully better, more compassionate, more appreciative, more tolerant people. They fully embrace life again, connecting, laughing, and loving with a full heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, there is no point of &ldquo;final closure.&rdquo; There is no point at which your clients can say, &ldquo;Ah, now I have finally completed my grief.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Yes, now I have healed.&rdquo; There is no point at which they stop missing their loved one or wondering what life would be like if they were still alive. There is no point at which they will never cry again, although as time goes on the tears are bittersweet and less common. Because we never forget, we carry our loved ones with us forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Closure&rdquo;? No, or at least not in the way people usually use that term. Acceptance &ndash; yes. Peace &ndash; yes. A future enriched with love, joy, and hope &ndash; absolutely. But putting a period behind the final sentence, closing the door and locking it behind you? No, life and love are much too complex for that. This part of your client&rsquo;s story does not end; instead it awaits the next chapter, which will undoubtedly build on all that came before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Stand with your clients as they grieve.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Let them know they do not have to forget or leave the past behind. Encourage them to create memories out of what can no longer be, and to live their lives as fully as possible enriched by those memories. Offer them the patience and understanding that few other advisors do. You will reap rewards both personally and professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/got-an-angry-client-on-the-line-heres-how-to-best-deal-with-them\">Got an Angry Client on the Line?

{"original_id":5235,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Change 7 Things People Hate About Your Website","link":"how-to-change-7-things-people-hate-about-your-website","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether it&rsquo;s being interrupted, talking during a movie, or wobbly tables &ndash; we all have pet peeves that drive us absolutely mad. Just as pet peeves exist in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, they are also evident in the digital world too.</p><p> As a Financial Advisor, you should be aware of some of the pet peeves your prospects and clients may have about your website. In this article, we will go over 7 things people hate about your Advisor website and how you can avoid them.</p><h3> 1. It takes forever to load</h3><p> Everyone is always on the go, including your clients. Can you recall a time when you got frustrated with a website because it took forever to load? Well, if your website is anything like that, your audience will feel just as frustrated as you did.</p><p> 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40% abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load.</p><p> If you want people to stick around your website, make sure that you&rsquo;re putting the time in to optimize it. For example, use images that are sized for the web rather than print. This will help decrease a page&rsquo;s overall load time.</p><h3> 2. It offers poor navigation</h3><p> When someone lands on your website, do they know what to do? Are you leading them through your website or letting them navigate through it all on their own?  Are you providing your visitor with direction and a number of different progression points? Easy to follow navigation is not only good for customer experience, but can help you convert those leads into clients.</p><p> According to Small Business Trends, 70% of small business B2B websites lack a call-to-action. A Call to Action (CTA) is a button or link that you place on your website to drive prospective customers to become leads. If the goal of your website is to create sales and get more business, then it is important that your website has effective CTAs.</p><p> Some quick and easy tips to improve your Financial Advisor websites navigation include:</p><li> Clear headlines</li><li> Jargonless copy</li><li> Concise CTAs</li><h3> 3. It&rsquo;s littered with cheesy stock photography</h3><p> You may already know that using images is great for SEO and grabbing (and keeping) your audience&rsquo;s attention. So when it comes to picking the right images, cheesy stock photography is not the way to go. Picture this: someone lands on your website and the first thing they see are images like these:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Great-Employees-1.jpg\" width=\"705\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Great-Employees-2.jpg\" width=\"705\"/></p><p> Are these pictures really believable or even realistic? Are these even your employees? Images are great for clarifying or enforcing an idea to your visitors. However, generic stock photography doesn&rsquo;t accomplish either of those things.</p><p> Try to use real pictures of real people at your company. If not, try to pick the best free, not-so-cheesy stock pictures. Using relevant and believable pictures on your Financial Advisor website will take your business a long way.</p><h3> 4. It contains a contact form but no contact information</h3><p> A &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; form may seem like a great way to generate an opt-in email list, but to a potential client, this provides very minimal or even no value because there is no incentive for them to give you their information.</p><p> About 44% of website visitors will leave a company&rsquo;s website if there&rsquo;s no contact information or phone number.</p><p> If a client or prospect has a one-time problem or request, they likely want help immediately. Having your contact information somewhere clear on the website, such as the footer or the contact page, is more useful to a client because it gives them a way to directly contact you. Whether it&rsquo;s your email, phone number, or office location (ideally, all three), let people know how to contact you and make that information easily available to your clients and prospects.</p><h3> 5. It has an unintelligible value proposition</h3><p> Who are you? What do you do? What makes you unique, different and better than other Financial Advisors? A solid value proposition is an essential tool to attract new clients, differentiate yourself from other Advisors, all while helping you to create a distinct and recognizable brand.</p><p> About 60% of investors found it hard to distinguish among Advisors because of their value proposition.</p><p> As a Financial Advisor, you want to create a unique and effective value proposition to help differentiate yourself in the industry and accelerate your business. Your value proposition concisely explains why a prospect needs you as their Advisor, and not your competition. (Read this blog post to learn more about writing a great value proposition).</p><h3> 6. It doesn&rsquo;t have a blog</h3><p> Inbound marketing is one of the most effective ways to grow your business, and comes at a lower cost. In 2015, content marketing generated 3 times as many leads as traditional outbound marketing, but cost 62% less. Blogging is one of the best ways to attract your target audience by creating and providing interesting and quality content, all while uninterruptedly marketing to them.</p><p> Businesses that blog receive 77% more traffic and 97% more links to their website than those that do not. </p><p> Blogging is a means of building credibility and thought leadership, and keeping your visitors coming back. Providing your prospects with useful information will build trust and add value to their experience on your Advisor website. When people search for information and answers &ndash; be a source they go to and trust. Your business will greatly benefit from this. As an added bonus, Google loves dynamic websites. Frequently writing blogs will help boost your overall search engine ranking, which in turn will increase your websites overall visibility and digital reach.</p><h3> 7. It&rsquo;s not responsive</h3><p> Have you ever visited a website using your mobile device and had to zoom in with your fingers because the text was too small on your screen? That&rsquo;s because the website you were checking wasn&rsquo;t mobile-responsive. With a higher percentage of people using their smartphones instead of their desktop when looking at information online, responsive design has never been more important.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 16:16:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 16:16:54.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_PA6QF6W.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-change-7-things-people-hate-about-your-website/\", \"post_id\": \"11150\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 16:16:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 16:16:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-change-7-things-people-hate-about-your-website\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11147\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5453\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-To-Change-7-Things-People-Hate-About-Your-Website.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1455\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463648400,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5236,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Pundits Advocating the 80/20 Approach to Managing Tasks Couldn't Be More Wrong","link":"why-pundits-advocating-the-80-20-approach-to-managing-tasks-couldnt-be-more-wrong","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Most time management pundits advocate using an 80/20 approach to managing tasks and time. Here is why &ndash; sometimes &ndash; they couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong.</h3><p> Earlier this week, I made a mistake. In my haste to get an e-mail out the door, I misspelled someone&rsquo;s name. Have you ever done that? Come on &ndash; you know you have. Or maybe you haven&rsquo;t misspelled it, but you called someone by the wrong name in a conversation. Or put Mr. instead of Mrs.</p><p> So I spent an hour carefully crafting a single e-mail to send out to a few people. Agonizing over which words to use, what particular messages I wanted to get across, what tone of voice would be most suitable.</p><p> And then I got one of their names wrong. Ouch. </p><p> The whole incident reminded me of an important lesson &ndash; sometimes, it pays to strive for  perfection.  See, what happened was very telling. In spite of the fact that I had agonized over the content of this particular e-mail, and something like 97% of it was spot on, I failed to get the final 3% right. Which made the other 97% absolutely, totally irrelevant. A big waste of time.</p><p> So here are five reasons why &ndash; sometimes &ndash; you really, really need to go the extra mile.</p><h3> It lets you stand out from the &ldquo;me too&rdquo; crowd.</h3><p> I am sure you heard the joke about the two guys and the bear. In case you haven&rsquo;t, here it is: two guys are walking in the woods and spot a bear. One guy starts running, the other one stops to put on running shoes. Guy one yells &ldquo;What are you doing ? You can&rsquo;t outrun a bear ?&rdquo; Guy two answers &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to. I just have to outrun you&rdquo;.</p><p> Moral of the story ? You don&rsquo;t have to be perfect either, you just have to be a little better than everyone else. By getting even a slight advantage over others, you will stand out in ways you never imagined.</p><h3> It valorizes all your hard work.</h3><p> As I illustrated in my example, failure to get a crucial part of your message (or project, paper, proposal) right can mean everything else has been in vain. Meaning all that time/money/energy you invested just went to waste.</p><p> Think of it like leverage in options trading &ndash; a small investment properly leveraged can yield HUGE positive returns.</p><h3> It gives you a sense of satisfaction/completion.</h3><p> Let&rsquo;s face it, most of us really want to do a good job. We want to be known for delivering quality work &ndash; even if no one is watching.</p><p> Steve Jobs once said &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you&rsquo;re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s there, so you&rsquo;re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.&rdquo;</p><p> Going the extra mile and getting that last bit just right is the equivalent to using a nice piece of wood on the back of the cupboard. Not only does it let you sleep well at night, but somehow, somewhere, someone down the line will notice.</p><h3> It actually delivers results.</h3><p> You don&rsquo;t get paid for working hard or putting in a lot of time or effort. The industrial revolution is over, and nobody gets paid for their time anymore. You get paid for delivering results. Focusing on getting the last 5% absolutely right dramatically increases your chances (by perhaps as much as 30% or more) of accomplishing what you set out to do.</p><h3> It accumulates over time.</h3><p> I love compounding. Making sure you go the extra mile where it matters means you&rsquo;ll quickly end up compounding results &ndash; whether it means making extra sales or getting promoted.</p><p> People tend to notice others who go the extra mile.

That&rsquo;s the number of Republican presidential candidates who ended their campaigns since last summer, leaving only businessman Donald J. Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee. Love him or hate him, it&rsquo;s time to come to terms with the reality that Trump&rsquo;s name will likely be appearing on the ballot in November. </p><p> As a money manager, I&rsquo;ve always said that it&rsquo;s the policies and not the party that matter. So it is with Trump. Many of his proposed policies certainly bode well for the market, including lowering taxes and scrapping needless regulations that slow business growth. Like his former rival for the GOP nomination, Ted Cruz, he has expressed support for a return to the gold standard and reportedly owns between $100,000 and $200,000 in gold bullion. In 2011, he even accepted a 32-ounce bar of gold as a deposit from a Trump Tower tenant.</p><p> However, as I told Kitco last week, I believe investors&rsquo; fears of a socialist Bernie Sanders presidency, not to mention negative interest rates, have driven a lot of gold&rsquo;s recent momentum, more so than the idea of a Trump presidency.</p><p> At the same time, Trump has taken positions that should concern investors. Besides exhibiting a volatile temperament and leadership style, he&rsquo;s been a harsh critic of free trade agreements and has made clear his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which aims to eliminate up to 18,000 tariffs among 12 participating countries. Andy Laperriere, head of policy research at Cornerstone Macro, believes Trump&rsquo;s trade agenda could even pose some risks to American multinationals, especially those dealing with Mexico and China, and the U.S. dollar.</p><p> Plus, there&rsquo;s the troubling comment he made last week on CNBC, proclaiming himself &ldquo;the king of debt,&rdquo;before adding: &ldquo;I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good. So therefore you can&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo;</p><h3> So What Are The Odds, Really?</h3><p> The cards are markedly stacked against Trump when it comes to winning in November. Most national polls show Hillary Clinton beating him in the general election, even though she is nearly as unfavorable to registered voters, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. Renaissance Macro Research calls Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;net negatives prohibitively high.&rdquo; And as I shared with you way back in August of last year,  Moody&rsquo;s Analytic s forecasts a win for the Democratic nominee, whether that&rsquo;s Clinton or someone else. Since 1980, Moody&rsquo;s sophisticated election model has accurately predicted the outcome of every single contest, and in 2012 it even nailed the Electoral College vote.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Pick-Your-Poison.png\" width=\"310\"/></p><p> Trump still has quite a lot of support in the financial industry. A Financial Advisor poll found that a little over 50 percent of respondents say Trump will win the White House, while nearly 37 percent say Clinton. Doubleline Capital founder Jeff Gundlach also believes Trump will be the victor, arguing that in the short term, this would be positive for the U.S. economy. The New York billionaire, Gundlach points out, has promised to build up the military and initiate an infrastructure program.  </p><p> Whomever voters end up electing in November, there will be winners and losers. Again, what&rsquo;s important to look at are the policies because they&rsquo;re precursors to change. We&rsquo;ll be watching the events as they unfold closely and adjusting our allocations accordingly.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 17:00:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 17:00:15.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_gGyvh63.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-are-the-odds-donald-trump-will-actually-become-president/\", \"post_id\": \"11157\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 17:00:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 17:00:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-are-the-odds-donald-trump-will-actually-become-president\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11155\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5456\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Are-the-Odds-Donald-Trump-Will-Actually-Become-President.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1790\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463655600,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

Our own research found that: </p><li> 40% of employees are less likely to think about a new job because of a positive work culture</li><li> Company events contribute to a 10% higher chance of retention</li><p> Company culture is also an important factor in employee productivity. The Department of Economics at the University of Warwick has found:</p><li> Happy workers are 12% more productive than the average worker</li><li> Unhappy workers are 10% less productive</li><p> These numbers illustrate the significance of worker satisfaction and should encourage struggling leaders to examine their company culture &mdash; an aspect of a business that is often lacking. </p><p> Here are the top 10 things to avoid doing if you want to keep the culture at your company cool, calm, and cohesive, thereby retaining your employees and productivity.</p><h3> 1. Pulling the money card</h3><p> Oftentimes, companies with a lot of capital will invest heavily in fancy perks while ignoring some of what really makes an employee stick around, such as a united vision for growth and meaningful work. Bosses may offer monetary incentives for extended work hours and greater commitments but ignore their employees&rsquo; personal needs. No one wants to be a sellout &mdash; your job is to make a work environment that employees will want to be a part of even if they could go and make more money elsewhere.</p><h3> 2. Yes, you&rsquo;re a boss. No, you shouldn&rsquo;t be bossy</h3><p> All employees need direction and guidance from their leaders, but the ultimate goal is to help them become self-sufficient and confident in their ability to innovate. If you rule your employees with an iron fist, requiring them to run everything by you with no breathing room, they will most likely leave for a job that offers more autonomy and opportunity to exercise their creative and independent spirits.</p><h3> 3. Putting yourself on the other side of the continental divide</h3><p> Do you expect your employees to act in accordance with company values, be willing to reevaluate their work, and participate in important training exercises? If such is the case, leadership should be doing all of that and more. You should be on your employees&rsquo; side, willing and able to do what you require of someone else. A leader should be the one most invested in company initiatives, even those that may seem basic or less significant.</p><h3> 4. Allowing stress to bubble over</h3><p> A short-tempered, high-strung boss can only lead to one thing: a stressed-out team. And when the team is not happy, the company culture turns dreary, productivity decreases, and employees leave for greener pastures. When an employee starts to vent to you, instead of letting the anxiety build, take the time necessary to listen and diffuse the situation.</p><h3> 5. One bad apple ruins the bunch</h3><p> In order for a company to have an actual &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; there needs to be commonalities between employees. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that they all need to look or act the same, or even have similar interests (diversity is extremely important to a productive workforce), but there must be a general sense that people get along and respect each other.</p><p> Even a single bad employee, one who perhaps gossips incessantly, slacks off, or worse (embezzlement and selling trade secrets are things that really do happen) can spoil the atmosphere for everyone. Take the time to hire the right people. Doing so will make sure that not only your customers are properly cared for, but that your entire team will be more comfortable and settled.</p><h3> 6. Treating employees like minions</h3><p> Your team is just as valuable to your business as your customers are, and they need to be treated as such. Relating to employees like a herd of cattle is hardly going to help them to capitalize on their strengths.</p><p> People should be recognized as individuals and appreciated for their accomplishments. An easy way to recognize your employees is through small gifts: treat them to a night at the movies, offer a gift certificate for a popular restaurant, or even simply mention those who have gone above and beyond their job description in the weekly team meeting. The more you help your staff grow towards their unique roles, the more loyalty they will feel towards your company or organization.</p><h3> 7. Hoarding your team&rsquo;s accomplishments</h3><p> Good leaders lead by example, setting their egos aside and humbly recognizing all of the people that contribute to a successful business. They know how to give credit where credit is due, sharing in the joy of accomplishments with their employees and acknowledging their important contributions.</p><p> Teams need willful and positive communication from their leaders, and they need to know they are on the right track and that they are valued. Without this type of communication, employees often feel confused about where they stand with leadership and are more likely to leave for a position that offers more clarity.</p><h3> 8. Creating an in-house war</h3><p> Yes, your company is competing with similar companies for business and clout, but that is where competition should come to a halt. As a leader, you should encourage each individual to act upon their strengths, not to simply outdo the guy in the office next door. Within a company, everyone should feel part of the team, one that encourages each of its members to do their best.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t confuse motivation with competition, however. It is a positive sign that your employees want to do their best, to be the best, but when it comes at the expense of the team, it has gone too far.</p><h3> 9. Assuming bosses know best</h3><p> Employees are often the ones most familiar with the dregs of your company&rsquo;s operation. Their perspective is almost always valuable and should be heard even when it is not. Learn to listen and to take others seriously. Who knows, maybe they have the secret to your next big break?</p><h3> 10. Tipping the work-life scale too far</h3><p> One of your employees has a sick baby? A nephew&rsquo;s graduation? A parent undergoing surgery? If your policy is &ldquo;be here or else,&rdquo; you may be in the game for some short-lived tenures. Of course, frequent and inexcusable absence or lateness is never OK, but lacking in compassion for your employees&rsquo; personal lives definitely doesn&rsquo;t elicit continued loyalty. Take interest in the individuals that make up your team and show them that they matter to you as people, not just workers.</p><p> Being a good leader is a balance between constantly analyzing your current behavior and deciding which new tactics will best serve your employees. Oftentimes, leaders focus on what they can do to improve company culture without first analyzing current behavior for any wrongdoings. By following these 10 tips of what not to do, you can avoid making any of the key mistakes that so often send employees looking for greener pastures.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 17:48:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 17:48:15.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_XmQYPS7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-things-to-keep-company-culture-cool-calm-and-cohesive/\", \"post_id\": \"11159\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 17:48:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 17:48:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-things-to-keep-company-culture-cool-calm-and-cohesive\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11158\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5457\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/10-Things-to-Keep-Company-Culture-Cool-Calm-Cohesive.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1176\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463677200,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5240,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Financial Advisors: Why Humans Are Not Wired for Disciplined Investing","link":"financial-advisors-why-humans-are-not-wired-for-disciplined-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to David Dubofsky, Ph.D., CFA, and Lyle Sussman, Ph.D. in their study, &ldquo;The Changing Role of the Financial Planner Part 1: From Financial Analytics to Coaching and Life Planning&rdquo;, approximately 25% of the financial advisor&rsquo;s contact with clients is devoted to non-financial issues. About 74% of planners estimate that the amount of time they are spending on these issues has increased over the last five years. </p><p> There is mounting evidence to show that financial advisors indeed have to radically change their approach to the way they relate to investors.</p><p> Money has always been a &lsquo;touchy&rsquo; &lsquo;emotional&rsquo; subject. Whether discussions resolve around &ndash; making it, losing it, sharing it, incorrectly quoting about it i.e. &ldquo;money is the root of all evil&rdquo; when the correct quote is, &ldquo;For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.&rdquo; Timothy 6:10 &ndash; the topic can become toxic.</p><p> Why then are we surprised (as I was) to find financial therapists popping up in our world? Or why do we think that financial advisors need to know all about our life and like a doctor? Is it unlike the mechanic that inquires about our driving habits as part of diagnosing a problem, or advising if those squeaky brakes need to be changed sooner than later? In that case, we&rsquo;ve surrounded ourselves with all sorts of professionals and experts, acting as doctors and therapists to help us along in meeting our daily needs and lifelong goals.</p><p> Well, it&rsquo;s actually quite simple really: the majority of us have no idea what triggers we inherently have that govern the way we manage our finances. We would be alarmed to know we have inherent biases. We would cringe at the thought of having allowed the bankruptcy our grandparents suffered to dictate the ugliness with which we now accumulate and &ldquo;store&rdquo; our wealth.</p><p> But take heart these triggers can be revealed, they can be managed and we can work with our financial advisors to develop plans to create wealth that line up with our life goals and values.</p><p> In his book  Behaviorally Smart Financial Planning: Behavioral Finance Made Practical for Advisors,  Hugh Massie makes the following comment, &ldquo;Observations and traditional risk profiles don&rsquo;t get below the surface where much about investor behavior is hidden. Financial advisors should know how to uncover what is happening as investors think through&rsquo; decisions.&rdquo;</p><p> The truth is financial advisors need to know how to uncover what lies below the surface of our decision making. They need to know what historical events impact our view of creating/managing wealth. So yes, they do have to approach the advisor/investor relationship a bit differently today. But here&rsquo;s the good news, they don&rsquo;t have to spend 8 years or so studying to become a doctor.</p><p> The right tools and training for uncovering our core natural behavior is the key. For example, DNA Behavior International has a significant discovery platform called Financial DNA that reliably discovers all dimensions of an investor&rsquo;s financial personality and inherent bias for making life and financial decisions. The discovery process is fast and accurate and places vital information in the hands of financial advisors before the first meeting with their investor clients.</p><p> Investors need an advisor who can guide and them towards making informed decisions, one who speaks to them in a style that&rsquo;s easily relatable while mitigating emotional, kneejerk responses. Emotion plays a significant role in so many parts of our lives that having an investor to coach us through the feelings and reactions, and keep decision making on the right track is necessary. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"463\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Humans-Are-Not-Wired.png\" width=\"554\"/></p><p> Financial advisors must understand their clients at a deeper level. It is essential to have a practical understanding of the psychology, emotions and biases that significantly influence investor&rsquo;s imperfect decision-making patterns. Furthermore, advisors should understand how to recognize and manage their own biases when working with investors.</p><p> Ultimately, it is fair to say that the role of the financial advisor has changed, and will continue to do so. But there is no doubt that with a reputable and appropriate process, advisors can be well informed in advance of a first investor meeting.</p><p> Conversations around money will always be complex. While we talk more freely about other intimate subjects, when money enters the conversation, emotion, distorted stories, ego, and even fear enter right along with it.</p><p> In conclusion, if we understand our financial behavior then we can balance our emotions and beliefs. We will act more wisely with our money. Conversely, if we lack understanding and are confused about why we make certain decisions, then the decisions will be poor, creating financial chaos and discontent. Advisors need to be fully equipped and prepared to unravel investor&rsquo;s complex issues around money. Investors need to be able to trust advisors in order to reveal information.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 17:54:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 17:54:44.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_tCJtSSO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-advisors-why-humans-are-not-wired-for-disciplined-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"11162\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 17:54:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 17:54:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-advisors-why-humans-are-not-wired-for-disciplined-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11160\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5458\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Financial-Advisors-Why-Humans-Are-Not-Wired-for-Disciplined-Investing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1028\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463806800,"author_id":88,"chart_url":""}

How to Be More Inclusive at Meetings","link":"are-you-listening-to-everyone-on-your-team-how-to-be-more-inclusive-at-meetings","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Depending on who you talk to, meetings are either the worst or best part of the day.</h3><p> While some enjoy the collaborative productiveness of meetings, others feel that meetings waste time, and that whatever&rsquo;s being discussed could better be addressed in other ways. Still, meetings remain a &ldquo;necessary evil&rdquo; in the business world&mdash;and particularly in cultures that embrace inclusiveness. Meetings offer the means to invite, and listen to, input from a broad range of stakeholders.</p><p> It&rsquo;s critical for leaders to be inclusive of employees who are part of their team&mdash;all employees. The workplace, and the marketplace, are far more diverse place than they have ever been. Gathering inputs from voices that reflect your market is, therefore, critical for business success.  </p><p> In Renee Cullinan&rsquo;s Harvard Business Review article  Run Meetings That Are Fair to Introverts, Women, and Remote Workers , she discusses how meetings that are productive for extroverts, men and/or on-site employees might not be inclusive of the many other groups of employees who are integral to your team&rsquo;s success.</p><p> Cullinan talks about the reasons that some groups tend to be ignored: introverts process information through thinking rather than speaking, thus not acting as quickly as extroverts; remote employees are &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind,&rdquo; meaning their feedback is not always taken into consideration; and men are seen as having more opinions or ideas to share than women, thus seen in the form of &ldquo;&lsquo;manterrupting&rsquo; (a man unnecessarily interrupting a woman) to &lsquo;mansplaining&rsquo; (a man interrupting a woman to explain something that she actually knows more about than he does) to &lsquo;bropropriating&rsquo; (a man taking credit for a woman&rsquo;s idea).&rdquo;</p><p> All of these assumptions or stereotypes, of course, circle back to unconscious biases. Cullinan notes that most leaders aren&rsquo;t intentionally being exclusive, but they&rsquo;re subconsciously acting on biases that they may or may not know that they have. If you look back on your own past meetings, you may realize that you&rsquo;ve inadvertently failed to include everyone&rsquo;s voices. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve focused primarily on the extroverts who speak first and most often; maybe you&rsquo;ve allowed a male employee talk over a female employee; or perhaps you haven&rsquo;t given as much weight to the input of a new, younger, employee.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for it 一 it happens to the best of us. But, don&rsquo;t let this behavior continue. An important first step toward inclusion is recognizing your own unconscious bias. The next is taking steps to address these biases by considering what you will do to make sure your meetings are productive for everyone&mdash;not just the more vocal employees participants.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let your unconscious biases drown out the voices of introverted or remote staff members. Be inclusive!   </p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 17:57:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 17:57:37.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_tOegP1H.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-listening-to-everyone-on-your-team-how-to-be-more-inclusive-at-meetings/\", \"post_id\": \"11164\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 17:57:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 17:57:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-listening-to-everyone-on-your-team-how-to-be-more-inclusive-at-meetings\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11163\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5459\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Are-You-Listening-to-everyone-on-Your-Team-How-to-Be-More-Inclusive-at-Meetings.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1078\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463684400,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s a website that provides automated financial advice with minimal human intervention. They basically use an algorithm and some basic input from the client to form a set of investment recommendations that your assets are invested into.  </p><p> Up until now, the high minimum amounts required for personal investment advice has left the middle class in the cold. Also, these services tend to price out at a rate which you have to be rich to pay. But now here comes McDonald&rsquo;s. A simple website, a math equation, a low fee - sounds good, right? How do I hand over the keys to the car?</p><p> Well, there is one factor that is being overlooked: human emotion. People are emotional about their money. What may seem like a good idea on paper can be seen in a different light when it has a real impact on your real life. </p><p> As an experienced financial advisor, I understand how human beings tend to behave when they see their money vanishing before their eyes.  Let me walk you through how a typical conversation goes every time I bring on a new client.</p><p> Me: So Beth, you&rsquo;ve got a long time horizon until your kids go to college, 20 years. Would you say you&rsquo;re an aggressive, moderate, or conservative investor?</p><p> Beth: Aggressive, for sure. I don&rsquo;t need this money for a while so I don&rsquo;t really care what happens to it. Put me in the most aggressive allocation you have.</p><p> Me: Are you certain about that?</p><p> Beth: Yes! </p><p> Me: Well, you&rsquo;ve got $100k to start with. Assuming 35% annual standard deviation, which is my most aggressive allocation, you would have had $650k during the market crash of 2008.  How does that sound?</p><p> Beth: Oh no, Sara, on second thought, I&rsquo;m afraid to take that much risk. Put my money into something more conservative. I can&rsquo;t put my three kids to college on that amount of money.  And, yes, I forgot that my mother is retiring this year so I&rsquo;ll need to give her $2k per month.  Can you factor that in?  Sorry Sara, I forgot to tell you that before. It just slipped my mind!</p><p> See what I mean?  This scenario illustrates how a simple conversation can bring us back in line with what potential outcomes will really mean for our lives.</p><p> In summary, although circumstances vary widely from one to another, I would say that roboadvisor platforms are a good way to get financial advice for those who have no emotion attached to their money, a long time horizon, and simple requirements.  </p><p> If you do have complicated trust and estate issues, a need for cash flow planning, or simply are not willing to hand over the keys to the car, better to opt for a human financial advisor. Although many require minimum portfolio values of $500k or greater, there are some out there that will take on a smaller one. They are a bit harder to find. </p><p> Indeed, McDonald&rsquo;s can be a great option, but before you put the pedal to the metal you may want to consult Zagat&rsquo;s and see what else is out there.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 18:23:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 18:23:13.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_RBXE1CK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-a-roboadvisor-is-like-getting-financial-advice-at-a-mcdonalds-drive-through/\", \"post_id\": \"11166\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 18:23:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 18:23:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-a-roboadvisor-is-like-getting-financial-advice-at-a-mcdonalds-drive-through\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11165\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5460\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-a-Roboadvisor-is-Like-Getting-Financial-Advice-at-a-McDonalds-Drive-Through.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"932\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463678100,"author_id":424,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5243,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Selling: Why The Secret Isn't That Secret","link":"social-selling-why-the-secret-isnt-that-secret","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I know it sounds redundant to say this, but I feel I have to.</p><p> Social selling is really just networking.</p><p> All of the strategies that work best in traditional, offline networking also work best in contemporary online social selling.</p><p> I feel I need to say this because lots of people seem to think they should be marketing, promoting, prospecting and selling in social networks. My approach is different. I think if you approach social networks first and foremost as a NETWORKER, then all the other marketing, promotion, prospecting and selling stuff will work out in your favour.</p><h3> Social networks are best approached as networking opportunities</h3><p> There are three things you need to focus on in order to be successful in your networking, whether it&rsquo;s online or offline:</p><li> Show up &ndash; You need to participate and you need to engage.</li><li> Show interest &ndash; Pay attention to people. Find out what they do and be interested in them. Don&rsquo;t focus on yourself.</li><li> Be helpful &ndash; Be a super connector, refer business when appropriate and generally be helpful.</li><p> Coincidentally (or not), online social networks are perfectly suited to these activities. It&rsquo;s easy to show up because there&rsquo;s no travel involved. It&rsquo;s easy to show interest because people in your network are sharing things every day. And it&rsquo;s easy to help because of the abundance of opportunities.</p><p> So, here&rsquo;s how I recommend you translate all three of these activities into effective online social networking:</p><h3> 1. Spend time in online networks every day <br/>  </h3><p> You have to show up and participate every day on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter or where ever your social networks hang out online. Of course, you can skip days if you are extremely busy or travelling or out of range with a connection, but most people can and should find a few minutes each day to stay in touch with their networks.</p><h3> 2. Pay attention to others in order to get them to pay attention to you <br/>  </h3><p> This is the simplest and most effective, yet too often overlooked, networking strategy. Consistently show interest in others and they will reciprocate. If you want people to pay attention to your content, then share their content and mention them. Read and &lsquo;like&rsquo; what people share and add your own thoughtful comments and you will be noticed. Focus more energy on promoting others online than you do yourself. As counterintuitive as that might sound, what you&rsquo;ll discover is that promoting others whose views you value is the best way to &ldquo;promote&rdquo; yourself in a networking setting.</p><h3> 3. Help people <br/>  </h3><p> This is not complicated. Think of all the ways you can help people. In fact, go ahead and ask people: &ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo; This may be the most powerful question you can ask. Then, try to help by connecting them with others, sharing their content, focusing the attention of your network connections on them. Helping is the new selling.</p><p> That&rsquo;s basically it. The foundation of good social networking is built on these three activities.</p><h3> Social networking works for anyone, but it&rsquo;s not for everyone</h3><p> This strategy is universal in that it can be used by anyone in any business. But it&rsquo;s not for everyone.</p><p> Some people are just not comfortable with this approach. They don&rsquo;t want to be out there, engaging with people in their network. They don&rsquo;t want to leverage their personal brand &ndash; they don&rsquo;t even want to think of themselves as a brand. They will often say they&rsquo;re too busy, but I know many very busy people that make time for social networking because they feel it&rsquo;s important.</p><p> Some people, I&rsquo;ve discovered, are natural social networkers. They love sharing and engaging with others. They recognize they have a valuable personal brand identity to leverage and that this identity is, in part, eternally validated by their networks. I don&rsquo;t mean this in a negative way, as if to suggest that social networkers are not independent, self-defined people. I mean it in the sense that a leader is externally validated as a leader by his or her followers. An influencer needs to actually influence people.</p><p> Social networks offer us a powerful set of tools for building and strengthening relationships between people. When you show up, pay attention and help people in your network, good things happen.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 18:42:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 18:42:38.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_VABbMIa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-selling-why-the-secret-isnt-that-secret/\", \"post_id\": \"11168\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 18:42:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 18:42:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-selling-why-the-secret-isnt-that-secret\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11167\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5461\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Social-Selling-Why-The-Secret-Isn\\u2019t-That-Secret.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1007\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463670000,"author_id":219,"chart_url":""}

That&rsquo;s why you need to be a brand. No seriously, I know I&rsquo;ve been repeating this like a broken record over the past years but it most certainly does.</p><p> There are three areas where the connection between customer&rsquo;s feelings and their shopping behaviour becomes most evident. Areas where the Rational Consumer is but Myth.</p><h3> TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</h3><p> Recent research shows that the way we relate to technology and its digital manifestation has drastically changed over the past few years. We started our pre-digital relationship to technology by perceiving it as an objective enabler for various goals with practical benefits. Now-a-days technology translates into an instant appraisal of how it can &ldquo;express and enhance who I am&rdquo; &ndash; an emotional goal touching on motivation and needs.</p><h3> CONSUMER GOODS</h3><p> Nowhere is the connection more surprising than in purchasing decisions when it comes to everyday goods. Dr. P.N. Murray and his team found that:</p><p> &ldquo;&hellip;consumers&rsquo; beliefs about a brand&rsquo;s personality are based primarily on their interpretation of its &ldquo;story&rdquo; &ndash; the narrative expressed in communication, packaging, and other marketing elements. The narrative communicates what the brand means to them &hellip; the emotional connection. It is this connection that makes consumers loyal to brands.&rdquo;</p><h3> LUXURY BRANDS</h3><p> We all know that luxury items are maybe the most emotional of purchases with no reason to buy a Tesla versus a Mercedes SLK beyond the fact that it intrinsically appeals to our aspirations and sense of self.</p><p> This new research also uncovered subconscious reasons behind each aspirational purchase decision</p><p> &ldquo;unconscious perceptions about a brand&rsquo;s authenticity and timelessness &ndash; what consumers describe as its &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; These perceptions evoke emotions &ndash; the sense of trust and security that is the essence of luxury for consumers.&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re in banking and quickly scrolled down to see if Financial Services was listed only to let out a sigh of relief not to see it I would suggest it&rsquo;s time you hold that breath and look up again because no matter how much we may not like to admit it, banking is part consumer goods, part luxury and it&rsquo;s all underpinned by technology and digital products so all of this, the irrationality of consumers, their need for an emotional connection is highly relevant to us.</p><p> So Mr (or, sadly far more unlikely, Mrs) Banker let me ask you this: do you know how your CBBE (Consumer Based Brand Equity) pyramid compares to that of Levi&rsquo;s, Amazon&rsquo;s or Google&rsquo;s? Does your bank have one? Shall we grab someone from the Customer Behaviour team and ask, maybe a Neuromarketing expert? Does your bank know what it is?</p><p> I&rsquo;d wager the answer is &ldquo;no, no, who?!? and no&rdquo; because we&rsquo;ve already established banks do not lift one finger to become a brand. In their defence there was no need &ndash; if they did not build delightful experiences and expressed their story and &ldquo;truth&rdquo; then what? What would the consumer do? Go to the next non-delightful-devoid-of-truth bank? The reality of it is that while there&rsquo;s ample safety in numbers and banks can continue to abuse its consumers by withholding delight some of them have where to go now. And the places they go to will fundamentally have built an identity and the type of strong brand that will make people join them and fall in love with them hence buy from them</p><p> While we struggle to understand why we should even put the consumer truly at the centre of what we build in retail, private banking and wealth made some &ndash;timid- steps in researching emotions and some studies have been surfacing. That&rsquo;s because they care, they want to make money.</p><p> That 1 point change in mortgage rates you debated for three months won&rsquo;t move the needle.

{"original_id":5245,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Active Managers: How to Become a Better Forecaster to Advance Your Performance Edge","link":"active-managers-how-to-become-a-better-forecaster-to-advance-your-performance-edge","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/Sammy_Suzuki\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sammy Suzuki </a>  </p><p> In a fiercely competitive world, active managers are constantly looking for ways to advance their performance edge. One good place to focus on is how to become better forecasters. </p><p> If just looking at averages, the active management industry has a spotty record. But some active investors manage to beat the market consistently, suggesting that they possess some degree of skill. If you can identify them or become one of them, the payoff is large. The question is, what separates skilled investors from unskilled ones?</p><p> Many people will answer that question by pointing to credentials or other markers: the manager seems especially smart, acts more authoritatively than others, shows more conviction or appears on TV more frequently.</p><p> The problem is that none of these factors is necessarily correlated with increased predictive capabilities. In fact, some of them have a mildly negative relationship to it. In a world engulfed in random noise, performance itself is a fairly unreliable measure of skill in the short run.</p><p> So what, then, are the traits common to the most skillful investors?</p><h3> A Teachable Moment</h3><p> We have some thoughts on the matter, largely drawn from the insightful research conducted by Philip Tetlock, professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction. The book is based on the findings from the Good Judgment Project, a multiyear study in which Tetlock and his colleagues asked thousands of crowdsourced participants to predict the likelihood of a slew of future political and economic events.</p><p> As the book&rsquo;s title suggests, &ldquo;superforecasters&rdquo; do, in fact, walk among us. Despite their lack of professional expertise, a small group of participants in the study significantly out-predicted both their fellow volunteers and teams of top professional researchers. And, over time, their advantage not only persisted, but grew. Most important, Tetlock found that good analytical judgment relies on a set of discrete approaches that can be taught and learned.</p><p> With that in mind, we offer a framework for investors looking to improve.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s About HOW You Think</h3><p> How forecasters think matters more than what they think, according to Tetlock&rsquo;s research. In fact, how a person approaches a research question is the single biggest element distinguishing a great forecaster from a mediocre one.</p><p> Predictive research is about focusing on the information that is most likely to raise the odds of being right: if you know x, your odds improve by y%. Superforecasters think in terms of probabilities; break complex questions down into smaller, more tractable components; separate the knowns from the unknowns and search for comparables to guide their view.</p><p> Professional investors and research analysts gather reams of data to build their forecasting models, a lot of which has little proven predictive value. Our research shows, for example, that there is little correlation between a country&rsquo;s GDP growth and how well its stock market performs.</p><p> Good investment forecasting is akin to meditating in the middle of Times Square. It requires learning how to isolate the few relevant &ldquo;signals&rdquo; from a cacophony of irrelevant market &ldquo;noise.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not something most of us are taught how to do in our formal education. In areas such as math, science or engineering, the relationship between general laws and what you observe is much tighter.</p><h3> Stay Actively Open Minded</h3><p> In reality, the range of possible outcomes of any event is wider than most people can imagine. Outcomes usually look obvious after the fact, but they frequently surprise when they happen. Tetlock&rsquo;s work suggests that a forecaster who considers many different theories and perspectives tends to be more accurate than a forecaster who subscribes to one grand idea or agenda. Being open minded also means accepting the (very real) possibility of overconfidence.</p><p> Superforecasters also have a healthy appetite for information, a willingness to revisit and update their predictions as new evidence warrants and the ability to synthesize material from sources with very different outlooks on the world.</p><h3> Maintain Humility</h3><p> It takes a certain kind of person to have both the humility to accept that they may be overconfident in their assumptions and predictive powers and the conviction necessary to manage an investment portfolio. It also takes a certain type of person to learn from their mistakes without overlearning. The best forecasters were less interested in whether they were right or wrong than in why they were right or wrong.</p><p> Using Tetlock&rsquo;s words, superforecasters also tend to be in perpetual beta mode. Like software developers working on an untested app, these people rigorously analyze their past performances to figure out how to avoid repeating mistakes or overinterpreting successes.</p><p> In the age of information overload, the active investor&rsquo;s edge increasingly lies in knowing what information matters and how to process that information. If you can identify skill&mdash;whether you are looking to hire a portfolio manager or you are a portfolio manager aspiring to improve&mdash;we believe that this superforecasting framework can give you a better shot at beating the market.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 18:51:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 18:51:37.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_uELHdLi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/active-managers-how-to-become-a-better-forecaster-to-advance-your-performance-edge/\", \"post_id\": \"11172\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 18:51:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 18:51:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"active-managers-how-to-become-a-better-forecaster-to-advance-your-performance-edge\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11171\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5463\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Active-Managers-How-to-Become-a-Better-Forecaster-to-Advance-Your-Performance-Edge.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"773\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463659200,"author_id":16,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5246,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Entrepreneurs Offer Business World Insight to Inspire Success","link":"three-entrepreneurs-offer-business-world-insight-to-inspire-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Right now in a small town in Indiana, a city in Ohio or a farm in California, young girls are dreaming of their future.  Many of those dreams have nothing to do with the boys from One Direction. Creativity is blooming and innovation is blossoming. Some day, these young ladies may find themselves on Fortune&rsquo;s list of the Most Promising Women Entrepreneurs. Created in 2009, the program honors extraordinary female leaders who have founded companies.</p><p> Three past winners of this honor offer insights into the entrepreneurial world that any business could benefit by following. </p><h3> The Ability to be Strategic </h3><p> Jody Miller is the co-founder and CEO of the Business Talent Group. She is a proponent of project-based solutions that offer independent professionals the opportunity to take charge of their work-life balance. Her company is on the leading edge of redefining the work place.</p><p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to have a sense of where the world is going and how you fit into it. If you need to supplement your existing skills, you need to know what those things you need are and how to get them. It requires a constant ability to understand where your skills are and where the market&rsquo;s needs are, and then you get the skills you need to supply what&rsquo;s most in demand.&rdquo;</p><p> To be competitive and relevant in the ever-changing work force, you cannot be content in your skills and wait for the perfect opportunity to knock on your doorbell, buzz on your phone or land in your email. You must keep yourself informed so you can have a battle plan.</p><h3> The Ability to be Flexible</h3><p> It could be easy to assume that the world of fitness has exhausted all its possibilities from the Jack LaLanne exercises in the 1940s to the current craze of CrossFit. But Payal Kadakia invented something new when she cofounded ClassPass. Customers pay a monthly fee and gain access to thousands of fitness classes in their area. Kadakia started the company two years ago after trying to find a ballet class in New York City. She just wanted to dance that day and couldn&rsquo;t. Her innovation has changed fitness. Over 7 million people have subscribed to the service.</p><p> &ldquo;ClassPass has pivoted its business twice, and we&rsquo;re hoping the third time&rsquo;s the charm. We started as a search engine, then offered the Passport, but ultimately were able to realize our vision through the ClassPass. Despite the evolution, our mission to help people live happier, active lifestyles has always been the same. To overcome the hurdles we faced, we&rsquo;ve had to be flexible in our approach in order to keep moving forward. It is better to take a few steps back and change directions than to keep going down the wrong road.&rdquo;</p><p> Technology, business and the vast world of social media form a trifecta that is constantly shifting like the hosts of The View. Flexibility in navigating the market is not an asset but a necessity. As Payal Kadakia opines, the willingness and ability to take a new approach in business can make the difference between a company being relevant or antiquated.</p><h3> The Ability to be Courageous</h3><p> The ubiquitous cyber-attack is almost a daily headline. Michelle Zatlyn met this phenomenon head on as the co-founder and head of user experience of CloudFlare, a service that speeds up websites and gives them enhanced protection from cyber-attacks. Websites that sign up with this global network load twice as fast and use 60% less bandwidth than other websites. Today, more than 2,000,000 web properties are faster and safer.</p><p> &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t take opportunities because the timing is bad, the financial side is unsecure. Too many people are overanalyzing. Sometimes you just need to go for it.&rdquo;</p><p> Zatlyn and her company take on the bullies of the internet every day. Cyber terrorism is real and on the up rise. Her courage has led the way to protect sites. Sometimes the ingredient that makes an entrepreneurial venture succeed is simply the guts to try it. We can all make lists of why we should not take a brave step towards our dreams. The ones who tear up that list and make the leap anyway are the leaders in the entrepreneurial world.</p><p> Women like these will continue to inspire and pave the road for young dreamers throughout the country.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-18 18:55:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-18 18:55:07.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_J3QzhRZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-entrepreneurs-offer-business-world-insight-to-inspire-success/\", \"post_id\": \"11174\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-18 18:55:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-18 18:55:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-entrepreneurs-offer-business-world-insight-to-inspire-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11173\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5464\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Three-Entrepreneurs-Offer-Business-World-Insight-to-Inspire-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"431\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463680800,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5247,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Overlook Investment Commentaries","link":"5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-overlook-investment-commentaries","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Here&rsquo;s a widely held belief: investment commentaries get in the way of the more high-profile initiatives that first attracted you to marketing.</p><p> In many respects, that&rsquo;s true. But we think there&rsquo;s more to the story.</p><p> While working on investment commentaries won&rsquo;t likely lead to any awards, it&rsquo;s a great way to learn about the industry and become a better marketer.</p><h3> 1. Learn more about the industry</h3><p> Working on investment commentaries is a crash course on the investment industry. For people newer to the industry, you&rsquo;ll learn about management styles, benchmarks, how the markets work, the impact of macroeconomics and much, much more.</p><p> For more experienced industry professionals, and involvement in investment commentaries makes regulatory changes a part of your day-to-day work. Admittedly, not the most exciting proposition. This regulatory awareness, however, helps you think about broader industry trends and how they may impact your profession in the future.</p><h3> 2. Expand your network</h3><p> Every company has a different group of people working on investment commentaries. Trust us, there&rsquo;s no universal template. And while that leads to some practical challenges, it presents a great opportunity &ndash; you&rsquo;ll get to work with a diverse group across your company, from legal and compliance to marketing, investments and product.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a little piece of irony here. Investment commentaries, such as MRFPs, appear to be a low-profile task, but they&rsquo;re very high profile among certain teams within your organization. So, if you want to grow your network, working on investment commentaries is a good way to go about it.</p><h3> 3. Work under pressure</h3><p> Month after month, quarter after quarter, year after year, disparate teams all across Canada and the world pump out investment commentaries. The timelines are tight and effective communication is essential to get the job done right. Calm, clear thinking is required from everyone on the team, as is a commitment to detail orientation.</p><p> These &ldquo;soft&rdquo; skills flourish under the ticking clock of an investment commentary project and they transfer over to all other marketing endeavours that you&rsquo;ll take on.</p><h3> 4. Write for a new audience</h3><p> If you&rsquo;re a writer, investment commentaries may open your work up a completely new audience. Whereas most marketing materials are geared toward retail investors, a significant number of institutional investors (and other distribution channels) will read about your firm&rsquo;s solutions through investment commentaries.</p><p> Institutional writing is higher stakes and the writing can be snappier and more technical. It also provides you with the opportunity to include some of that jargon you try to avoid when writing for a retail audience.</p><h3> 5. Focus on process</h3><p> Investment commentaries are among the most process-driven marketing projects in the industry. We write, edit and project manage investment commentaries for a significant number of the world&rsquo;s largest financial services firms. As such, we&rsquo;re always learning about new ways to improve our clients&rsquo; processes.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 17:47:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 17:47:42.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_VfSIYEB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-overlook-investment-commentaries/\", \"post_id\": \"11176\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 17:47:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 17:47:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-overlook-investment-commentaries\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11175\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5465\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5-Reasons-Why-You-Shouldnt-Overlook-Investment-Commentaries.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"724\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463734800,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5248,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ask Yourself These Key Questions Before Taking the Real Estate Plunge","link":"ask-yourself-these-key-questions-before-taking-the-real-estate-plunge","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Real estate is red hot right now. Unlike post-2008 when it was a buyer&rsquo;s market (to put it mildly!), today it&rsquo;s not uncommon for sellers in &ldquo;hot&rdquo; areas to get multiple offers on a property and end up getting as much as 20% over the offering price.</p><p> Prices are skyrocketing again and, even better (at least for the property owners), rental rates are on the upswing as well. For anyone with the assets to invest in rental property, the environment begs the question: is now the time to jump on the real estate bandwagon?</p><p> I received this email from my client Garnett last week:</p><p> Hi George.</p><p> Fred and I have been talking about purchasing a rental property using my recent inheritance from Mom as a down payment. Specifically, we are looking at houses under $200,000 in the Tacoma area where it is really a hot market right now. We&rsquo;re thinking about building on these investment properties over time as a secondary income to support our retirement.</p><p> Any thoughts or ideas? I have been doing lots of research and have a great mentor who had been doing this for a long time. She has been so helpful. </p><p> First, full disclosure: I have a thing for real estate. 45 years ago, back in 1970, I bought my first rental property. For $14K, I was able to buy a duplex in an edgy neighborhood of Colorado Springs. To make it my own, I just had to write a check for $500 to assume a $13,500 VA loan, so it was pretty easy to take on even as a young man with a young family. Over the years I kept buying houses and condos, then a warehouse, and more recently some &ldquo;scrape&rdquo; teardown properties in Denver. In the last 5 years the stakes have gotten higher, but I&rsquo;ve finally found a way to simplify my role of landlord using passive real estate where the tenant, instead of the owner, is responsible for the maintenance (whoopee!), property taxes, and insurance. So yes, I believe in the value of real estate in general, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s right for everyone, nor that every opportunity is a good one.</p><p> Here are four key questions to consider before deciding to take the plunge:</p><h3> 1. Is real estate a &ldquo;better&rdquo; (higher return) investment for your portfolio than stocks?</h3><p> Real estate is so different from stocks that this is hard to answer. That said, real estate offers tax benefits through the use of depreciation that can be used to shelter part of the generated income. Plus, the use of leverage in real estate can sometimes turn a small down payment into a sizable return. For example, say Garnett puts down $40,000 (20%) on a $200K purchase price. If the house increases in value by 5% a year, with her leverage of 5 to 1, she has the potential to make a whopping 25% a year on her investment. (5% of $200K is $10,000, which is 25% of the cash down payment of $40,000). That certainly beats the recent stock market return numbers!</p><h3> 2. What are the disadvantages of real estate?</h3><li> Lack of liquidity is always a concern&mdash;especially for older investors who may require access to liquid assets. In a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; market (which we&rsquo;ve not seen for quite a while), it typically takes 4 or 5 months to sell and close on a property. In today&rsquo;s market, that time can be much longer, which means your assets are tied up until the deal is complete.</li><li> Property maintenance and vacancies can create an &ldquo;alligator&rdquo; that eats away at cash flow. Maintenance is (or at least should be!) a given. Every homeowner knows how the costs of things like a new roof, plumbing problem, or landscaping and gardening can add up. Your tenants are likely to be much less willing to wait on repairs than you are on your own home, so unexpected costs can hit at the worst time. Also, vacancies (which happen in any market) are a reality, and whether you&rsquo;re collecting rent that month or not, you have to be able to make payments on the mortgage.</li><li> Managing a property takes time&mdash;or money. To take care of your property and your tenants, you either have to be a landlord yourself or hire a management company at a cost of around 8% of the rent collected. If you choose to be the landlord, you have to expect and respond to calls at all hours. And if your tenant&rsquo;s pipes burst while you&rsquo;re on vacation, you&rsquo;ll have to put your own plans on hold to deal with the situation. Be realistic about what you&rsquo;re most willing to give up: time or money.</li><h3> 3. What pitfalls should I avoid?</h3><p> When it comes to buying property, there are many potential pitfalls, but here are a few to consider:</p><li> Buying when your finances aren&rsquo;t in great shape. Make sure your income is stable, your consumer debt is paid off monthly, and your emergency fund is intact. If you aren&rsquo;t 100% certain you can make the payments on a new property, don&rsquo;t consider it an option.</li><li> Buying with a partner, especially a family member. Managing a rental property is stressful enough alone; bringing in a second party can easily add to this stress and, in worst cases, be too much for even the best relationships to handle.</li><li> Overpaying. Just as when you&rsquo;re investing in stocks, it&rsquo;s best to buy low and sell high. Be sure you&rsquo;re viewing a property from a rational&mdash;not an emotional&mdash;perspective to be sure you&rsquo;re making a wise investment. As you look, ask yourself: Would I want to live here? And, would I be willing to pay the rent that I&rsquo;m asking a tenant to pay?</li><li> Neglecting estate planning. The more property you have, the more important estate planning is. Take the right steps to be sure your heirs don&rsquo;t inherit a real estate nightmare and large legal fees.</li><h3> 4. What&rsquo;s the best way to fund the purchase?</h3><p> Putting down 20% on a rental property is not only recommended, but it&rsquo;s often required. This means a $200K home requires $40K down (plus closing costs of another $4-$5K), and the resulting loan would be $160K at about 4% interest. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay any points at that rate, and you may be able to avoid paying a loan origination fee as well.</p><p> After exploring all of the above with Garnett, we agreed that diving into the world of rental property made sense for her, and she&rsquo;s going ahead with a purchase in Tacoma. If you&rsquo;re considering the leap yourself, proceed slowly, check the depth and temperature of the water before jumping, and if everything feels right, take the plunge.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 17:55:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 17:55:42.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_xs7Ghej.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ask-yourself-these-key-questions-before-taking-the-real-estate-plunge/\", \"post_id\": \"11178\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 17:55:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 17:55:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ask-yourself-these-key-questions-before-taking-the-real-estate-plunge\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11177\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5466\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ask-Yourself-These-Key-Questions-Before-Taking-the-Real-Estate-Plunge.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"574\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463749200,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}

Overall, women just don't make money issues a priority in their lives.</p><p> As a financial advisor and a woman, I feel it's important to empower women through free financial education. Along the way, I have discovered that it's a huge challenge to try to convince women that they need to know more about their money.</p><p> Don't get me wrong. Women do think about money. Our gender is very good at worrying about it all the time.</p><p> According to the American Psychological Association report \" <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Stress in America </a> ,\" women are much more stressed than men, and our biggest stress is money. Dr. Helen Coons, president and clinical director of Women's Mental Health Associates, explains. \"It's the socioeconomic and relational context of women's lives here in America,\" she said. \"A high percentage of women have dependent children, work outside the home and then come home to a second shift, often with inadequate support.</p><p> \"We still see gender inequity,\" she adds. \"Women earn less, and if they're employed part-time, they're less likely to have health benefits and financial resources.\"</p><p> A recent Prudential study on the \" <a href=\"http://www.prudential.com/media/managed/wm/WM-womens-research-summary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Financial Experience &amp; Behaviors Among Women </a> \" shows, unfortunately, that women have not come a long way when it comes to money. Women feel no more prepared to make smarter financial decisions today than they did three years ago &mdash; or even a decade ago.</p><p> When asked about their confidence in themselves to achieve their financial goals, women had responses that startled me. This so-called \"confidence gap\" has not improved over the past 10 years, either. Really? No improvement?</p><p> \"Women have been disenfranchised,\" said Dr. Kate Levinson, psychotherapist and author of \"Emotional Currency: A Woman's Guide to Building a Healthy Relationship with Money.\"</p><p> \"Society doesn't empower us,\" Levinson said. \"We've been acculturated to stay dumb about money &mdash; legally, and culturally, for generations.\"</p><p> After reading these studies, I was quite shocked.</p><p> The studies did get me thinking, and they helped me understand why women have what I call the \"ostrich effect\" when it comes to money. Women, overall, refuse to accept reality, preferring to ignore the truth that we need to know about money. Instead, we bury our head in the sand.</p><p> We don't get in the money game, because we do not want to get messy, and money can be a little intimidating. You could make a mistake or two, and you probably will. Heck, I would say that I have made at least that many mistakes. This is coming from a woman who thinks, breathes and lives her life learning as much as she can about money.</p><p> And while I will admit that I have made many mistakes along the way, I have made many more fantastic money decisions. The goal is to take action and take control of your financial life.</p><p> I would like to share three simple steps you can take now to become smarter about your finances.</p><h3> 1. Get educated</h3><p> Learning about money is important, and the more of a role you take, the more enjoyable it becomes. I started off taking a few classes at New York University and loved it so much that I have devoted my entire life to educating others about finances.</p><p> This might be a little extreme (I admit that I am a total nerd), but I can guarantee that you will be better off if you start to get a handle on your finances. There are hundreds of books, podcast, blogs and videos that can help you gain a better understanding of your personal finances. Dr. Levinson insists that we can't \"stay dumb\" about money. \"It limits our options in the world, not to mention feelings of self-worth and competency.\"</p><h3> 2. Track and budget</h3><p> In order to make smart decisions about your money, you have to understand where your money is going. Start by tracking your expenses for one to two months. Once you see where your money is going, you can start to weed out the unnecessary expenses. Use this information to create a budget that reflects your needs instead of your wants.</p><p> To help make tracking and budgeting easier, you can download smartphone or tablet apps such as Mint, GoodBudget and Expensify. Creating and keeping your budget is one of the simplest ways to not only learn about your finances and spending habits but to be more informed and involved so that you can make smart decisions about money.</p><h3> 3. Start saving now</h3><p> Retirement might seem like an eternity away &mdash; especially for women in their 20s, 30s and even 40s &mdash; but saving for it is incredibly important for financial security. The earlier you start saving for retirement, the better your financial picture will look in the future.</p><p> If your company offers a 401(k) plan or 403(b), make sure you contribute as much as you can. This is especially important if they offer to match your contribution. Remember, this is essentially free money going into your retirement account. If your company doesn't offer a 401(k) or 403(b), consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. The sooner you start saving, the longer you are allowing your money to grow.</p><p> Women can be very smart with money. All we need to do is start getting in the game and stop believing that financial issues are too complicated for us to understand.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 18:22:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 18:22:04.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_TJZfzYq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/money-matters-why-too-many-women-bury-their-heads-plus-3-steps-for-success/\", \"post_id\": \"11180\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 18:22:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 18:22:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"money-matters-why-too-many-women-bury-their-heads-plus-3-steps-for-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11179\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5467\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Money-Matters-Why-Too-Many-Women-Bury-Their-Heads-Plus-3-Steps-For-Success.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"616\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463752800,"author_id":449,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5250,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How an Affair Can Affect a Couples' Financial Relationship","link":"how-an-affair-can-affect-a-couples-financial-relationship","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> An Interview with Dr. Janis Spring by Lili Vasileff</h3><p> I was fortunate to have the opportunity to interview Dr. Janis Spring about her work with couples who have experienced the event of an affair in their relationships. I was curious how this may play out in financial behaviors between the spouses, and what if any, financial measures become part of the aftermath of an affair.</p><p> Janis Abrahms Spring, Ph.D., ABPP, is a board certified clinical psychologist and nationally acclaimed expert on issues of trust, intimacy, and forgiveness. Her first book, &ldquo;After the Affair: Healing the Pain and Rebuilding Trust When a Partner Has Been Unfaithful,&rdquo; has sold more than a half million copies and was a Books for a Better Life Award finalist in the categories of Best First Book and Best Relationship Book. She is author also of &ldquo;How Can I Forgive You? The Courage to Forgive, The Freedom Not To&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life with Pop: Lessons on Caring for an Aging Parent.&rdquo;</p><p> In private practice for more than 40 years in Westport, Connecticut, Dr. Spring is a recipient of the Connecticut Psychological Association&rsquo;s Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Practice of Psychology and the Connecticut Marriage and Family Therapy&rsquo;s Award for Distinguished Service to Families. Her website is  <a href=\"http://janisaspring.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://janisaspring.com </a> .</p><p> Working with couples both as a financial mediator and as a financial specialist in divorce, I asked Janis how an affair may affect a couples&rsquo; financial relationship in addition to their emotional relationship. I wondered if the subject of prenuptial and postnuptial agreements were an item of discussion in therapy. Not surprisingly, the answer was &ldquo;it depends because each situation is unique.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Janis:  </strong> When one partner is unfaithful, the other partner (the hurt partner) experiences not just a shattering of trust, but a psychological trauma &ndash; a shattering of self. No matter what they do, they can&rsquo;t recapture the way they&rsquo;re used to knowing themselves &ndash; attractive, fun, zesty, steady. They&rsquo;re bombarded with images of their partner and this other person, even while they sleep.</p><p> Lili: Does this loss of sense of self and the relationship require some atonement by the hurt partner from the unfaithful partner?</p><p> <strong>  Janis: </strong>  If unfaithful partners want to rebuild trust, earn forgiveness, and perhaps, reconcile, yes, they need to make the hurt partner feel safe and cherished. This is accomplished through concrete acts of atonement and caring. For some hurt partners, it may mean the unfaithful partner gives up alcohol and joins a 12-step program; for others, it may mean getting into couples therapy and working to understand what created space between them that made room for someone else to come in between them.</p><p> Lili: What are some tangible means of providing assurances or measures of protection?</p><p> <strong>  Janis: </strong> It depends on the circumstances surrounding the affair and what the hurt spouse needs as a concrete gesture from the unfaithful spouse.</p><p> I have what I call &ldquo;low&rdquo; and &ldquo;high&rdquo; cost trust-building behaviors. An example of a &ldquo;high&rdquo; cost trust building behavior is that the hurt partner is allowed to hire a private investigator (which the unfaithful partner pays for), and the hurt party can contact that person to track the unfaithful partner whenever they feel suspicious. (Often the unfaithful partner&rsquo;s willingness to do this is all that is needed. It shows an intention to be faithful, an intention to be accountable and to help the hurt party heal).</p><p> For others, a concrete gesture or act of atonement may be to secure finances in the hurt spouse&rsquo;s name. As part of earning forgiveness and making the hurt party feel secure, the unfaithful partner may be asked to sign a postnuptial agreement that spells out how the financial assets will be divided if the couple divorces.</p><p> Or, alternatively, certain assets, such as the family home, may be re-titled in the name of the hurt spouse.</p><p> Everything is subject to negotiation, but the hurt spouse may feel that these concrete acts are necessary if they&rsquo;re going to reinvest themselves in the marriage.</p><p> Lili: What happens if these negotiations fall part or if the unfaithful spouse feels they are being manipulated and coerced into something just to have their pound of flesh extracted for a sense of justice?</p><p> <strong>  Janis: </strong>  Sometimes the unfaithful partner feels this way and the conditions of repair have to be negotiated, but other times, the unfaithful partner wants to rebuild trust and earn forgiveness, and is grateful to be given concrete steps they can take to rebuild the marriage.</p><p> I should say, often, even with affairs, there isn&rsquo;t one hurt partner and one offender. Often, both partners have felt hurt over the life of the marriage, and both have offended the other in some significant way.</p><p> <strong>  Lili:  </strong> Looking back over the decades of couples you have helped in therapy, what are your impressions about the lasting impact of an affair?</p><p> <strong>  Janis: </strong> I am very impressed with how couples can take responsibility for what went wrong in their marriage and how they go on to rebuild a new marriage &ndash; often with the same person.</p><p> Genuine forgiveness is reframed as an intimate dance, a hard-won transaction, which asks as much of the offender as it does of the hurt party. Offenders learn how to perform bold, humble, heartfelt acts of repair to earn forgiveness, such as bearing witness to the pain they caused, delivering a meaningful apology, and taking responsibility for their offense. Hurt parties learn to release their obsessive preoccupation with the injury, accept a fair share of responsibility for what went wrong, and create opportunities for the offender to make good.&rdquo;  &mdash; from Janis&rsquo; bestselling book, &ldquo;How Can I Forgive You.\"</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 19:52:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 19:52:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_HVrHhIs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-an-affair-can-affect-a-couples-financial-relationship/\", \"post_id\": \"11182\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 19:52:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 19:52:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-an-affair-can-affect-a-couples-financial-relationship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11181\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5468\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-an-Affair-Can-Affect-a-Couples-Financial-Relationship.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"742\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463745600,"author_id":307,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5251,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Current Trends Tell Us About the Future of the Hedge Fund Industry","link":"what-current-trends-tell-us-about-the-future-of-the-hedge-fund-industry","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://www.agecroftpartners.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Don Steinbrugge </a> |  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/donsteinbrugge\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Agecroft Partners </a></p><p> The following comments are excerpted from Agecroft Partners&rsquo; Don Steinbrugge&rsquo;s presentation delivered at the 69th CFA Institute Annual Conference held on May 9th, 2016 in Montreal. In Mr. Steinbrugge&rsquo;s session titled &ldquo;What Current Trends Tell Us about the Future of the Hedge Fund Industry&rdquo; he discussed a number of the recent quotes and articles directed to the hedge fund industry that were covered broadly by the media. </p><h3> Third Point Capital CEO Dan Loeb thinks hedge funds are in the first stage of a &ldquo;washout&rdquo; after &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; performance this year.  </h3><p> The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index posted a decline of -0.67 % in Q1 of this year, which on the surface isn&rsquo;t that bad. Upon closer examination, this moderate decline is hiding the vastly different paths various managers and strategies traveled during the quarter.</p><p> In January and February, strategies with a lot of beta, exposure to the equity and fixed income markets, such as activists, long/short equity, and distressed debt, generated very poor performance, which was significantly worse than most investors&rsquo; expectations. Investors do not mind if these strategies underperform during a bull market, but they are expected to reduce downside volatility during periods when the market sells off. Fortunately, these strategies rebounded significantly during the month of March and only finished the quarter slightly down. Nonetheless, investors remain disappointed that these strategies did not provide the downside protection they expected.</p><p> Strategies that are uncorrelated to the capital markets performed very differently. For example many direct lending and reinsurance managers posted positive returns in each of the first three months. Market neutral and relative value fixed income managers generally exhibited significantly less volatility than high beta oriented strategies. CTAs, although volatile, enhanced a diversified portfolio&rsquo;s Sharpe Ratio by being negatively correlated during the quarter; they were up in January and February and then gave back some of the gains in March when other strategies rallied.</p><p> What is also not apparent when looking at the quarter's performance is the huge dispersion of returns exhibited by managers within each strategy. In many cases there was over a 20% differential in returns between the best and worst performers within a single strategy. When strategies underperform investors&rsquo; expectations and when dispersion of returns between managers increases significantly, it results in a significant increase in fund redemptions, especially for those managers that underperformed.</p><p> It is our belief that most of this money will stay within the hedge fund industry. Some will be reinvested within the same strategy with managers that have significantly outperformed their peers. Other will shift away from high beta oriented strategies that exhibited significant volatility in the first quarter and re-invest in uncorrelated strategies that protected investors&rsquo; capital during the selloff in January and February.</p><p> This increase in demand for strategies uncorrelated with the capital markets is also driven by two other factors. The first is investors&rsquo; concern that the capital markets have significant tail risk. The sluggish growth of the world economy raises fears of another 2008 type selloff, which could be compounded by monetary authorities around the world lacking the dry powder necessary to stimulate the global economy.</p><p> In addition, hedge fund investment decisions stem from allocators&rsquo; forward looking view of each strategy&rsquo;s expected return and associated risk (volatility). Back in 2009, it was very difficult to raise assets for a market neutral equity strategy or a relative value strategy expected to generate mid to high single digit returns because most investors were looking for strategies that could generate mid teen returns. As interest rates came down, spreads tightened and equity valuations increased, investors&rsquo; return expectation for beta oriented strategies declined. Three years ago, investors were generally looking for a 10% minimum return to warrant an allocation. Over the past three years expected returns have continued to decline. Today most investors are looking for a mid to high single digit return for their hedge fund portfolio.  In this environment, uncorrelated strategies look very competitive from a risk return standpoint.</p><p> As investors pull their money out of poorly performing funds, we will see an increase of fund closures. Some of these firms&rsquo; assets will decline to the point where they are no longer profitable. Others will acknowledge that the significant drawdown they suffered in the first quarter will materially impair their ability to raise capital for the next several years.</p><h3> Hedge funds lose most money since 2nd quarter of 2009.</h3><p> It is true that the hedge fund industry saw the most outflows in the first quarter of 2016 since the second quarter of 2009.  To put this in perspective, the hedge fund industry has grown fivefold in the past 15 years from approximately $600 billion in 2000 to $3 trillion at the end of 2015.  The $15 billion of outflows the industry experienced in the first quarter of this year represents only one half of 1 percent of the industry assets. Even eight quarters in a row of $15 billion in redemptions, would barely make a dent in industry&rsquo;s AUM.</p><h3> Former hedge fund manager and multi-billion dollar family office CEO Steve Cohen recently spoke at the Milken Institute Global Conference and stated, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to maximize returns and also maximize assets.&rdquo;</h3><p> Many hedge fund investors agree that there is an inverse correlation between assets size and performance. This can be viewed on an industry basis and at the manager level. At the industry level, the 5x increase in hedge fund industry AUM since 2000 has made it more difficult for managers to generate strong returns.</p><p> While this does not mean that hedge fund managers cannot make money, it does mean that return expectations have generally come down and more so in some strategies than others.</p><p> At the manager level, before 2008 it was very common for successful hedge fund managers to close their doors to new investors to keep assets under management at a level where they could maximize returns. Today, more and more managers are growing their assets well above their optimal asset level and effectively prioritizing asset gathering over performance. </p><p> Some institutional investors&rsquo; hedge fund strategy is to build out diversified portfolios comprising of the largest most well know managers. While some large managers continue to generate very strong returns, a portfolio diversified across only the largest managers will probably generate sub optimal returns.</p><h3> Cohen also noted that talent within the industry is thin.</h3><p> The number of hedge funds has significantly increased in the past few years to an estimated 15,000 funds. We believe that only 10-15% are of the quality to justify their fees. These percentages are also consistent with our views on the mutual fund industry where most managers under perform their benchmark. The high percent of lesser quality managers considerably dilutes the performance of the hedge fund industry as a whole which is reflected in the returns of the hedge fund indices. Even with the recent poor performance, I believe that money will stay invested in hedge funds, in large part because most professional hedge fund investors believe they can do significantly better than the indices. The key to successfully investing in hedge funds is to select the strategies and the top talented managers that will enhance the risk adjusted return of a portfolio. Seeing an increase in the closure rate of low quality hedge fund organizations would be a positive for the industry.</p><h3> Buffett stated that hedge funds get unbelievable fees for bad results.</h3><p> Not surprisingly, the hedge fund industry views these comments as prejudicial and unfair. While his comments may be true for a majority of funds, there are a number of managers that are extremely talented and well worth the fees they charge. In addition, there are a number of strategies that add significant diversification benefits to portfolios that cannot be replicated by ETFs or index funds.</p><h3> Christopher Ailman, CIO of CalSTERS, stated the &ldquo;2 and 20 model is dead.&rdquo;</h3><p> Actually, the standard fee, included in hedge funds&rsquo; operating documents, has come down very little over the past few years. We have, however, seen a significant increase in hedge funds negotiating lower fees for large, institutional mandates. Pension funds, like CalSTERS, that can allocate more than one hundred million dollars to a manager should almost never have to pay 2 and 20 unless it is for a truly exceptional manager or for a capacity constrained strategy. Large pension funds that allocate to small and midsized managers should be able to negotiate fee arrangements that are 25-50% below the standard rate.</p><h3> &ldquo;NYCERS votes to exit hedge funds. Will other pension funds follow?&rdquo;</h3><p> Approximately 18 months ago CalPERS also voted to exit all hedge funds. Although widely covered by the media and discussed across the industry, almost no other pension fund followed CalPERS&rsquo; lead until NYCERS&rsquo; decision. We do not believe many pension funds will eliminate hedge funds from consideration in their portfolio for two primary reasons. First, most pension funds take an academic approach to their asset allocation which includes formulating forward looking assumptions for returns, volatility, and correlations for each component of their portfolio. These assumptions are based on a number of factors including long term historical returns for an asset class, current valuation levels, and economic expectations. Most institutions are currently using a return assumption for core fixed income of between 2.5% and 3%. Up until last year these investors&rsquo; return assumption for a diversified hedge fund portfolio was between 4% and 7%. Even if those return assumptions decline, they should still be higher than those forecasted for fixed income. As long as the expected returns from a diversified hedge fund portfolio, after fees, is higher than those of a traditional fixed income portfolio, most pension funds will continue to invest in hedge funds.</p><p> Second, pension funds will not eliminate all hedge funds from their portfolios because hedge funds are not an asset class, but a fund structure comprising many different strategies. Some of these can add valuable diversification to a portfolio. Many pension funds learned, during the market selloff in the fourth quarter of 2008 that they were not as diversified as they thought. Correlations between strategies and individual investments rose closer to +1.0.  There is still a valuable place for investments which can improve the risk/reward profile of pension portfolios.</p><p> In conclusion, aside from the effects of changes in market value, we expect the hedge fund industry&rsquo;s total assets at the close of 2016 to be fairly close to where they started the second quarter of the year.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 19:57:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 19:57:31.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_FvMYD7b.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-current-trends-tell-us-about-the-future-of-the-hedge-fund-industry/\", \"post_id\": \"11184\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 19:57:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 19:57:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-current-trends-tell-us-about-the-future-of-the-hedge-fund-industry\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11183\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5469\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Current-Trends-Tell-Us-About-the-Future-of-the-Hedge-Fund-Industry.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"806\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463731200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Even more so, was the inspiration felt as the day of collaborative judging unfolded. </p><h3> My Story</h3><p> My time in the corporate sales environment proved to be up to me to produce results. There was virtually no team work or leadership in the office. In fact, the opposite usually prevailed in the form of secrecy. The reason for this was the desire to win the year-end recognition to include a trip and sizable bonus.

Client loyalty is built alongside employee loyalty too.</p><h3> Team Meetings <br/>  </h3><p> Everyone is expected to contribute ideas and consensus develops more quickly. This serves to increase motivation to always perform at one&rsquo;s best capacity.</p><h3> Creativity <br/>  </h3><p> Working with creative ideas, instead of the norm, will produce better than expected results. Another aspect is to view new ideas as Opportunity vs. Risk. In this regard, new revenue streams develop.</p><h3> Diversity <br/>  </h3><p> Different lines of thinking coming from a global team provides far greater insight into client need. Service delivery becomes highly targeted and well-received.</p><h3> Mindset <br/>  </h3><p> Invariably obstacles will arise in any organization. But by keeping a positive mindset and providing continual encouragement, team members surpass the hurdles more quickly.</p><h3> Legacy <br/>  </h3><p> Each candidate stated their desire is to start building their legacy by giving back to communities in need. Their first step was to practice by building their teams well. By building the team loyalty and earning tremendous feedback, they were positioned to do the same for those in need.</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> Whether an employee or an entrepreneur, it is a very good idea to move forward as if you are a team player.

{"original_id":5253,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Forget Millennials, Gen Z Will Change Your World Again","link":"forget-millennials-gen-z-will-change-your-world-again","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielBurrus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Daniel Burris </a>  | <a href=\"http://www.burrus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Burris.com </a></p><p> Millennials have long been the focus of attention, but as the first wave from Gen Z enters the workplace, there will be another shakeup on the horizon.</p><p> Business and marketers have been falling over themselves trying to appease &lsquo;Millennials&rsquo; who were described as the biggest retail and employment disruptor of our time. However, as they are now thought to be 20 to 35, they are no longer the new kids on the block but are now getting older, and this represents a very different challenge to both businesses and marketers.</p><p> Every generation will develop different wants, needs and desires as they progress through the different stages of life and their responsibilities change. Much of what we thought we knew about Milennials is about to change as they enter the next phase in their lives and begin to think about starting a family or financially planning for their long-term future, so we need to stop thinking of them as 15-year-olds. </p><p> They typically shunned debt and have famously believed to have put experiences over possessions by keeping a simple, minimalisticlifestyle and their lack of interest in cars still completely baffles the auto industry, but these attitudes could begin to change as they settle down into adulthood.</p><p> By contrast, Generation Z are starting to have purchasing power as they arrive in the workplace and are the first real digital natives who were raised on using five screens such as the smartphone, desktop, laptop, tablet and TV to communicate and digest information instantaneously but are equally easily distracted. The oldest members of Gen Z (born roughly between 1995 and 2010) will turn 20 this year, and their arrival is signaling a wave of change in the business landscape that could dramatically change the economic climate.</p><p> Millennials will start feeling old at an office party when nobody understands their tales of reminiscing over iPods and MySpace. Their younger colleagues cannot remember a time without social media or smartphones as technology has always been there dominating their lives; they are the first generation not to be excited by it, in fact, it&rsquo;s stepping away from tech and gadgets that feel alternative and cool.</p><p> Having been technologically proficient from such a young age, less is more, and any communication needs to be incredibly concise considering whole conversations can be achieved with a single image thanks to emoji&rsquo;s.</p><p> Whereas the Millennials were all about filtered photos and edited videos that fueled their egos with likes and comments. Gen Z embraces living in the right now and enjoys sharing the world through their eyes through Snapchat stories that enable them to tell their story of a day in their life in an unedited video that will last for 24 hours before disappearing forever.</p><p> This simple change in habits will result in moving millions of marketing dollars away from the unfavored Facebook, and this is probably one of many reasons why Snapchat bravely turned down a $3 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s social network.</p><p> When surveyed it also predictably revealed that this new generation are proud cord cutters who seldom watch traditional tv or cable packages and would much sooner stream their content on services such as Netflix or YouTube.</p><p> We often talk about disruptive technology, but we should prepare for the arrival of Gen Z and accept how they are already beginning to change the corporate landscape. The gray suits behind large corporations that struggle to move anything forward are deemed too clunky and in a brave new digital world where rapid change is expected as the norm, the message is simply to keep up or get left behind.</p><p> Whereas previous generations had a worldview that was shaped by the media, these new kids on the block were leaving traditional stereotypes behind and regularly communicate with individuals from every corner of the world and understand at a relatively young age that everyone is essentially the same regardless of location.</p><p> Platforms such as Snapchat and Periscope have allowed them to tune in and see unedited daily routines of how people live their lives all over the world free from media bias. This has resulted in these global citizens relating to each other on a personal level and developing an understanding of just how similar all of our lives are all over the world.</p><p> As we continue to see the rise of individuality and the personalizing of almost everything we are already seeing larger companies beginning to struggle with their one size fits all marketing campaigns from auto do-not-reply email addresses that merely leave this new audience cold, in fact, they barely use email anyway.</p><p> More and more will turn away from clocking into an office 9-5 like many of their parents and siblings have done before them. Sluggish business practices and failure to continuously improve and evolve could even lead to a dramatic rise in solopreneur&rsquo;s or localized entrepreneurial business ventures forcing larger brands to change their ways</p><p> Just when you thought you understood the mindset of the Millennial, life has thrown another curveball in your direction. Whether its disruptive technology or even a next generation workforce, this is simply a wake-up call to illustrate how individuals or businesses can no longer have a static view and definition of a generation and must embrace rapid change before its too late.</p><p> With Gen Z turning their back on TV, E-Mail and the fake world of celebrity, idealistic Millennials embrace the sharing economy as many will continue to steer clear of owning a car or their own home. This will increasingly impact the economy if old businesses no longer understand or are relevant to the two dominant generations.</p><p> Are you already noticing subtle changes in attitudes, spending habits and engagement from Gen Z audiences?

I had no idea what was coming next, but I knew that a typical retirement was not going to happen for me.</p><p> And what&rsquo;s more, I knew that a lot of other people were in the same boat. So many entrepreneurs throw themselves into their company to the point that work, especially working at a high level, becomes a central part of their identity. Once they step away from the daily press of running a business, they can feel a little lost.</p><p> So I wondered, how can business owners learn to write a new story for their lives? How can they create a &ldquo;Life 2.0&rdquo;? And how can they start the journey before they walk out the door?</p><p> You may not be ready to retire or sell your business&mdash;it might even be years before that happens&mdash;but it can still be a good idea to start wrapping your mind around &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p><h3> What&rsquo;s Next for Your Company</h3><p> Why start thinking about Life 2.0 now? Because there&rsquo;s a lot to be gained by starting early. You give yourself more time to look at your organization and do the things you need to do to:</p><p> &raquo;   Maximize the value of the company and ensure that a forward-focused culture is established.</p><p> &raquo;   Have a leadership development plan in place for others to step up and take over.</p><p> &raquo;   Ensure that you transfer the knowledge that is important to carry the busi-ness forward.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t a task list that can be knocked out in six months. It takes upwards of two years to get it set.</p><p> You may also find that preparing your company for the long run&mdash;by building your team, investing in new markets, <br/> documenting and refining your operations&mdash;will deliver amazing results in the short term, too.</p><h3> And What About You?</h3><p> And while you&rsquo;re working to ensure a solid foundation for your company, you need to think about &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next&rdquo; for you.</p><p> Maybe you&rsquo;re not sure what you&rsquo;re going to do, but three simple steps can get you started:</p><p> <strong>  Think about what gives you a spark  </strong></p><p> Is it a passion or hobby that&rsquo;s fallen by the wayside? A cause or career that&rsquo;s a big draw for you? Now is the time to start looking into it. As busy as you are right now, you might find small ways to start pursuing these extracurricular passions&mdash;and feel more energized as a result.</p><p> <strong>  Start cultivating new relationships </strong></p><p> True, work relationships change when you leave. It takes time to build a supportive community, so scout for the groups outside of your work that may figure into your new career or Life 2.0.</p><p> <strong>  Talk to people about your plans  </strong></p><p> Let people know what you may be looking for and what&rsquo;s interesting to you.

I handed a ball of yarn to one individual and asked them to throw the ball to a person in the circle who they depend on to get their job done. Then that person throws the ball of yarn to another participant who they depend on. Each person holds onto a piece of the yarn before tossing the ball. What results are interconnected and overlapping strands of yarn that forms a giant web. The visual is profound and helps everyone see how much we need one another to achieve our goals and deliverables.</p><p> What does your web of interconnections look like? Who are the people you count on in your work world?</p><p> Why is it so important for leaders to depend on others?</p><h3> 1. TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE&rsquo;S POINTS OF VIEW</h3><p> A great benefit from working with other people and listening to their ideas and suggestions is learning about different approaches to solving problems. Sometimes we are so stuck on seeing issues from our experiences that we forget there are alternative solutions. In a recent workshop, a manager was frustrated that several of her team members wouldn&rsquo;t follow her tried and true procedures but rather wanted to test out a new strategy. By keeping an open mind she learned a new way to approach an on-going challenge. By depending on her younger team members, a customer&rsquo;s need was creatively solved.</p><h3> 2. WE AREN&rsquo;T STRONG IN ALL SKILL AREAS</h3><p> We each have our strengths as well as our blind spots. Recognizing that we may not have the strongest skill set in a particular area is a sign of strong leadership. Instead of thinking that we are smartest person in the room, reach out to a team member with the  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2016/01/03/creating-a-team-of-leaders/#sthash.H2qruN1n.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  best experience and knowledge </a>  to help an outcome shine.</p><h3> 3. MEANINGFUL COLLABORATION FOSTERS TRUST</h3><p> On many teams I work with, I notice that there is far more competition than collaboration. The magic in teamwork is knowing how to bring individuals together for the betterment of the team. Here are a few ways to build trust to lead from wherever you are:</p><li> Ask your team members about their life outside of work</li><li> Find out what each person is really good at doing</li><li> Encourage team members to use their talents at work</li><li> Give credit to each person&rsquo;s contribution</li><li> Share something personal about yourself with others</li><h3> 4. WE WILL CREATE BETTER OUTCOMES</h3><p> When leaders depend on others they are honoring their abilities and knowledge. They are telling team members that they have important ideas and suggestions. They are empowering each person they connect with to offer their strongest work. When people feel valuable they will be more creative and even work harder. The result of including the contributions of others is a richer outcome and project. In my Team Building workshops I use the mathematical equation: 1+1=3. What? Exactly! We can achieve more as a team than the individuals working alone. So depend on others for great results!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 20:43:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 20:43:56.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Sdfey9B.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-know-these-4-reasons-leaders-depend-on-others/\", \"post_id\": \"11192\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 20:43:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 20:43:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-know-these-4-reasons-leaders-depend-on-others\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11191\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5473\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-You-Know-These-4-Reasons-Leaders-Depend-On-Others_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1447\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463767200,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}

So busy that you don&rsquo;t have time to read a book on time-management &mdash; so don&rsquo;t.</p><p> Rob and Mike from  <a href=\"http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Startups for the Rest of Us </a>  have packed a book&rsquo;s worth of time-saving tips into one podcast episode, and we thought we&rsquo;d boil them down even further.</p><p> Here are nine ways to attack your time, taken from Rob and Mike&rsquo;s &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-204-9-tactics-for-aggressive-time-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  9 Tactics for Aggressive Time Management </a> &rdquo; episode.</p><h3> 1)  Respond to Your Emails in the Morning</h3><p> Lots of people will tell you not to email in the morning. Rob and Mike disagree.</p><p> While some say emailing in the morning will bog you down and steal your most productive hours, there&rsquo;s a way to do it that will optimize your productivity.</p><p> First, answer quick things quickly. Respond to emails that don&rsquo;t require much thought. Then organize the rest of your emails into a to-do list for later.</p><p> Maybe the best reason to email in the morning is to prioritize your day. If a task requires another party&rsquo;s input, get them involved immediately. If you have an urgent email from the night before, put it at the top of your list for the day.</p><p> During the first hours of the day, you&rsquo;re thinking at your highest capacity. So make sure you&rsquo;re tackling your highest priority early on and not discovering an urgent task after lunch.</p><h3> 2) Say Goodbye to Being Notified</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Say-Goodbye-To-Notifications.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p> Facebook, Twitter, and email notifications will steal your time. You want to attack your day with your own strategy and not be thrown off course. So turn off all your notifications.</p><p> No one needs to be notified immediately every time their product is mentioned on social media. If <br/> something requires your attention immediately, your contacts should know to call or text you. This will allow you to stay on task with your priorities.</p><p> It&rsquo;s really hard to do, but do it anyway. You&rsquo;ll be surprised how much more energy you can direct towards what&rsquo;s really important.</p><h3> 3) Put Off Mainstream News</h3><p> Mainstream news is a trap.</p><p> Like Facebook, Twitter, and other social media, news applications are designed to pull you in with a couple of articles that matter to you. Fifteen minutes later, you find yourself consuming information completely unrelated to you that has no material impact on your life.</p><p> However, your brain needs time to relax, unwind, and, put immediate struggles aside for a moment. For this, use podcasts, audiobooks, or even pure fiction. These lower your stress levels, educate you, and get your creative juices flowing.</p><h3> 4) Banish Your Phone</h3><p> Your phone is intentionally designed to capture your focus. Make sure it only does so when you say it can.</p><p> At work, it may be necessary to have your phone available for clients. But when you&rsquo;re working, you should actually be working. (And for that matter, when you&rsquo;re with your family, you should be enjoying your family.)</p><p> The psychology of how we interact with phones is strange, but predictable. If your phone is within arm&rsquo;s reach, chances are you&rsquo;ll be tempted to check it regularly. If you can&rsquo;t reach it, chances are you won&rsquo;t even try.</p><p> So if you can, put your phone in a different room. At the very least, keep it resting beyond an arm&rsquo;s length.</p><h3> 5) Guard Your Email Address</h3><p> It&rsquo;s a general habit to say, &ldquo;Email me if you have questions.&rdquo; In reality, people will email you about the important stuff whether you tell them to or not. Encouraging additional communication is inviting just that&mdash;additional, quite possibly unnecessary, communication.</p><p> Instead of throwing in a casual email invitation, try this: &ldquo;I wish you the best of luck with your project.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s simple, sincere, and to the point.</p><p> If someone asks, &ldquo;Hey, can I email you?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s OK to say yes. Just do so with discretion.</p><h3> 6) Be a &ldquo;No&rdquo; Man (or Woman)</h3><p> Your default answer should be no unless there&rsquo;s a compelling reason to say yes.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll be asked to donate  your time, your brain, and your resources. If you say yes to everything, you&rsquo;ll over-commit yourself. Further, you&rsquo;re always more likely to let your own work fail before someone else&rsquo;s, so you&rsquo;ll attempt to meet other people&rsquo;s needs at the expense of your own business.</p><p> In the beginning of your career, it&rsquo;s OK to say yes more, since you have more time and are looking to make your mark. But be careful not to build up a habit of over-commitment, since the more you say yes, the more people will ask.</p><h3> 7) Schedule Your Tweets, Religiously</h3><p> Twitter captivates and engages your audience. According to the  <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pew Research Center </a> , almost three-fourths of online adults use social networking websites.</p><p> One hundred million people are tweeting daily. So if you use Twitter, do it every day and knock it out of the park, or don&rsquo;t use it at all.</p><p> How do you maintain an active presence on Twitter without it consuming your life? Schedule your tweets.</p><p>  </p><p> Use a tool like  <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Buffer </a>  and have your tweets released throughout the day while you&rsquo;re doing other things.  </p><h3> 8) Be Forgetful</h3><p> That&rsquo;s right. You&rsquo;re remembering way too much.</p><p> The more scattered material your brain is remembering at once, the less energy it can focus on needed tasks. When a thought presents itself&mdash;someone mentions a book you should read or your spouse tells you to pick up a stick of butter at the grocery store&mdash;store it away.</p><p> Applications like  <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Trello </a>  allow you create organized groups of items, so you can arrange tasks and ideas and reference them when needed. Trello even allows you to share lists in the cloud with a colleague or spouse&hellip;so everyone can be on the same page.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Trello.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p> This frees up your brain and does the remembering for you.</p><h3> 9) Don&rsquo;t Go to Meetings (if You Can Help It)</h3><p> High-volume productivity requires stretches of uninterrupted . . . productivity.</p><p> Attack your schedule with that in mind. Move meetings and disengage during large chunks of time whenever possible.</p><p> The idea is to eliminate those staccato-type interruptions throughout the day and block off hours at a time. Meetings are killers of that goal.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> Time is everything. More time means more results, more productivity, and more family. Implement these ideas, and watch the efficiency of your work multiply.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 20:48:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 20:48:15.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_y3JXqXu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/say-goodbye-to-being-notified-9-insanely-time-saving-tactics/\", \"post_id\": \"11196\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 20:48:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 20:48:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"say-goodbye-to-being-notified-9-insanely-time-saving-tactics\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11193\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5474\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Say-Goodbye-to-Being-Notified-9-Insanely-Time-Saving-Tactics.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"821\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463770800,"author_id":208,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5257,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Have an Insubordinate Employee? Here Are 3 Tactics to Manage Them","link":"have-an-insubordinate-employee-here-are-3-tactics-to-manage-them","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Q &ndash; I just started managing a new team and one of my staff members is close friends with my boss. I keep noticing them having personal powwows and secret strategy sessions without me. And there have been a couple times where I&rsquo;m pretty sure he was actively undermining me. I&rsquo;m feeling very frustrated and pretty powerless in this situation. What are your tips for managing an insubordinate staff member?</p><p> A &ndash; Yikes. I&rsquo;m not going to sugar coat this for you, managing the type of insubordination you&rsquo;re describing is tricky &ndash; not impossible &ndash; but certainly a challenge. I&rsquo;ve had the misfortune of having to work through a couple of these situations in my career and I&rsquo;m painfully aware of just how exasperating it can be. To get through it with your career intact you have to strike an extremely delicate balance. You need to be strong without being defensive. You need to be aware without becoming paranoid. It&rsquo;s the kind of career obstacle that will test even the most seasoned manager.</p><p> In my experience, the best first step to managing the situation is to understand what brand of insubordination you&rsquo;re dealing with. Here are a few of the common scenarios you should be on the lookout for. Each one demands a carefully thought out strategy to overcome.</p><p> The CEO&rsquo;s brother in-law just got moved onto your team. And he&rsquo;s incompetent. How the heck are you supposed to hold him accountable without getting into hot water? </p><p> You just took over a new team and your boss&rsquo;s best friend from college is on it. How do you get her to respect you and follow direction? </p><p> You&rsquo;ve got an overly ambitious staff member with a habit for going straight to your manager with ideas and suggestions. How much is too much? </p><p> One of the company&rsquo;s founders has just been moved onto your team. She&rsquo;s been here forever and seems to have special access to the CEO. Is this a problem or an opportunity? </p><p> Your new boss has a habit of directing your staff members without talking to you first. Its sending a confusing message and marginalizing your position. How do you get this to stop?</p><p> The landscape of insubordination is complex to say the least. Not all of the situations I&rsquo;ve listed can be managed the same way. I&rsquo;m not even sure they&rsquo;re all necessarily negative. In some of these cases there may even be opportunities hiding under the surface if you play it correctly. What I do know is that in all cases where insubordination is present or probable, there are three things I try to do to give myself the best chance of coming out on top. These tactics are by no means guarantees &ndash; insubordination is a messy business &ndash; but they will improve your odds.</p><p> One of the things you&rsquo;ll immediately notice about my favorite tactics is that they&rsquo;re not defensive. They&rsquo;re not predictable either. My observation of most managers is that they almost universally respond to the slightest hint of insubordination with a full frontal assault. They get pissed. They get defensive. They get paranoid. And they almost always make things worse. The sad reality is in many cases of insubordination, especially those where a team member has a special relationship with your boss or a superior, you don&rsquo;t have as much actual leverage as you think you do (or should). That&rsquo;s why so many of us end up even more frustrated when we get nowhere after complaining to the boss about their old college buddy circumventing the chain of command. Sure there are some cases where you can snuff out insubordination using your legitimate authority. If you&rsquo;ve got an ambitious team member who likes to skip you and jump straight to your boss, you can deal with it head on and your boss will support you. But when that ambitious team member is also your boss&rsquo;s nephew, you need to get more creative.</p><p> Here are my three best tactics for handling an insubordinate employee when a conventional strategy won&rsquo;t work:</p><p> Threesome? Our natural reaction to insubordination is to fight back. We try to restrict their access to the boss. We try to stop the bad behavior by playing defense. Unfortunately, this approach rarely works and it can make you look petty and paranoid if you&rsquo;re not careful. In my experience, it can be much more effective to take the complete opposite approach. Rather than trying to stop the employee from having secret meetings and private powwows with your boss, why not join them? Why not create more opportunities for the three of you to meet? Why not take the secret dialogue between the two of them and turn it into a three way? There are a lot of positives that can come from this counter intuitive approach:</p><p> By building more three-way discussion you curb the secret dialogue and get to participate.</p><p> Instead of seeming paranoid and defensive you seem confident and supportive.</p><p> With a stronger three-way bond your boss will be less likely to want to engage without you.</p><p> My advice to managers when dealing with insubordination is to consider leaning in instead of being defensive. Find ways to actively encourage more three-way dialogue to make a private 1 on 1 relationship seem unnecessary.</p><p> Shine a light. Another tendency for managers when struggling with insubordinate behavior is to deal with it too quietly. We talk about it in whispers and complain about it to our spouses and colleagues instead of casting a light on it. The problem is, when you fight against surreptitious behavior with your own surreptitious behavior, the result is, more often than not, pestilential paranoia and a complete lack of trust. Why not take the opposite approach? Why not bring everything out into the open? Why not sit down with the insubordinate employee and have a positive conversation about the situation? I&rsquo;m not talking about telling her all the reasons you&rsquo;re pissed either. I&rsquo;m suggesting you sit down with her and have a conversation about how her special relationship with your boss must be challenging for everyone &hellip; including her. I&rsquo;m suggesting you dial down the paranoia and ratchet up the empathy. Several good things can come of this:</p><p> By putting everything out on the table you&rsquo;re delivering a message without having to fight.</p><p> By having a positive conversation vs attacking or accusing, you will be seen as a leader.</p><p> By recognizing the challenging situation she&rsquo;s in, you demonstrate empathy and build trust.</p><p> My advice to managers is to combat covert insubordination by bringing everything into the open in a positive way. Start talking about the situation without attacking it. In my experience you&rsquo;ll find this approach goes a long way to containing negative insubordinate behavior.</p><p> Silver Linings Playbook. As managers, we tend to fixate on the negative aspects of insubordination and completely ignore the potential positives. Obviously many, if not most cases of insubordination don&rsquo;t bring opportunities - but some do. Especially cases where your insubordinate employee is a relative or close friend with your boss or superior. In these cases, you can actually make the insubordinate relationship work in your favor. Why not use this special access to further your own relationship with your superior? Why not draft off any favoritism to help get your team&rsquo;s projects sponsored and implemented? Why not team up with your special team member instead of going to war? In my experience we&rsquo;re too quick to go nuclear when insubordination is afoot. It can sometimes pay off to take a quick step back and investigate the opportunities of going positive before we go negative. Some benefits of drafting off an employee&rsquo;s special relationship include:</p><p> Get yourself more access to superiors and more face time with your boss.</p><p> Get more support for your projects, and more access to budget.</p><p> Deal with less criticism for your team&rsquo;s work and get faster and easier alignment.</p><p> My advice to managers is to look at every situation objectively.

From day one this message was hammered into our thinking&mdash;the needs of the Bureau come first. Always.</p><p> When success also meant survival, landing on my feet when confronted with the unknown was essential. Over time, I learned to look at risks as opportunities to be exploited, whether it was a messy investigation or new squad assignment.</p><p> Real success was walking away from uncomfortable situations with more savvy and skill than when I started.</p><p> Every successful entrepreneur and leader understands that risk involves change and moving outside their comfort zone. In today&rsquo;s competitive and fast changing workplace, they can never hope to achieve success unless they&rsquo;re willing to embrace change and risk the discomfort of failure.</p><p> Conventional wisdom says that women take fewer risks than men, but is it true? Much of the difference can be attributed to the way boys and girls are socialized as children. In general, boys are reared to shoot from the hip early on. Girls learn about risk differently. Risky behavior, girls are told, is dangerous.</p><p> If conditioning is partly to blame, then reconditioning is part of the answer. Adopting a &ldquo;Gritup&rdquo; mentality can make all the difference.</p><p> Research finds that men and women use different strategies, and different parts of their brain, when making choices on how to keep moving toward goals.</p><p> Here are 3 science-based reasons men and women look at risk differently:</p><h3> 1. Risk: Stress Makes A Difference</h3><p> A recent study by Mara Mather and Nichole R. Lighthall found that male risk-taking tends to increase under stress, while female risk taking tends to decrease under stress. The researchers discovered that there are gender differences in brain activity involved in computing risk and preparing for action. This is important given the stressful nature of our work lives today.</p><p> <strong>  CAUTION TIP: </strong> Beware of stereotyping men as too reckless and women too cautious. Instead, when in stressful situations it might make more sense for men and women to work together to make smarter risk-taking decisions.</p><h3> 2. Risk: Immediate vs Long-Term Rewards</h3><p> A review published in Behavioral Brain Research discovered that the majority of women in the study tended to focus on immediate rewards while the majority of men in the study tended to focus on long-term rewards.</p><p> <strong>  CAUTION TIP: </strong> Men may appear to be stubborn and unwilling to change course once a strategy is put into action, but his brain engages the top, dorsal area of the orbitofrontal cortex which focuses on long term rewards. Most male brains seek out irregular patterns of behavior that will provide them with the competitive advantage they need to set goals that will produce long-term rewards.</p><p> <strong>  CAUTION TIP: </strong> Women may appear to be feckless and unable to stick with a strategy, but her brain engages the medial part of this region which is involved in identifying regular patterns and immediate rewards. Her brain is able to assimilate new information that enables her to make adjustments to strategies that will lead to rewards accordingly.</p><h3> 3. Risk: Bait-And-Switch</h3><p> An article published in Scientific American Mind explains why women are more comfortable with switching strategies mid-task, something that is difficult for men because men tend to engage the part of their brain linked to long-term rewards.</p><p> <strong>  CAUTION TIP: </strong> Women may appear to uncertain or worried about making errors, but her brain is taking the time to gather more information. In fact, it is a woman&rsquo;s detailed exploration that makes them more attuned to change. They can clue into changes quicker than their male counterparts.</p><p> <strong>  CAUTION TIP: </strong> Men may have a harder time abandoning a project, course of action, or strategy because their brains tend to focus on big rewards later, unlike female brains that are often satisfied with small gains now.</p><p> Researchers caution that neither approach is better; both are necessary and useful in daily life. What is key is understanding how these differences can be turned into advantages through collaborative efforts involving both sexes.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 20:54:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 20:54:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_G6HT9A4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-science-says-about-men-and-women-looking-at-risk-differently/\", \"post_id\": \"11200\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 20:54:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 20:54:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-science-says-about-men-and-women-looking-at-risk-differently\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11199\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5476\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Science-Says-About-Men-and-Women-Looking-at-Risk-Differently.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"619\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463738400,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5259,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Family Dynamics Affects Wealth Transfer","link":"how-family-dynamics-affects-wealth-transfer","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Laura Roser&rsquo;s Q&amp;A with Matthew Wesley</p> <p> Matthew Wesley has spent the last twenty-eight years working with wealthy families as an estate planning attorney and family advisor, facilitator and catalyst for improved communication and successful wealth transfer.</p><p> <strong>  LR:  How did you become an expert  in shifting family cultural dynamics? </strong></p><p> MW: I have had two careers &ndash; first as a minister and then as a lawyer.  My first career sensitized me to how hard it is to get communities of people with different personalities and agendas to successfully work together.  Difficult, but not impossible, if you understand group dynamics and methods of community building. Leading is largely a process of facilitation and the dynamics of religious communities (and in fact all groups) have elements similar to how most families function.  When I became a lawyer, I saw the same dynamics in law firms: getting competent and often headstrong people to create a common culture required real grit and determination.  Some law firms excel at this.  Many don&rsquo;t. Those that do are wildly successful. Those that don&rsquo;t sputter. The techniques of community building in both community and professional domains are complex, but forging culture is key to successful team building and organizational development. Or in this case, shifting family culture.</p><p> As a lawyer, I became deeply aware that the central fact in families of wealth are structures created by lawyers.  They create trusts, various entities and foundations that are often designed to last for generations.  Families must live with these structures and the advisors who accompany them.  In many families, these structures prove to be damaging to individuals in the family and to the family as a whole.  It would be ideal if lawyers were more sensitive to these issues, but most are not.  Lawyers are experts providing solutions to a very narrow set of technical problems &ndash; usually related to tax or governance issues. The only way for families to succeed in the face of these structures is to develop a robust and resilient family culture that can serve as a counterweight to the powerful forces of the structures and the advisory network.</p><p> What I learned in ministry is that for a group to work effectively, they must have a grounded commitment to what I refer to as &ldquo;a deep moral purpose.&rdquo;  This means that they develop a commitment to the each other and to the world that will creatively withstand ambiguity and uncertainty.   This is what keeps families together, instead of running for an exit at the first sign of difficulty.</p><p> Shifting family culture moves a family from the singular focus of independence to one of both independence and interdependence. There are various ways to move cultures in this direction. It is this work that was the focus of my career in ministry and is now the focus of my wholly secular work with families. It is deeply human work.</p><p> <strong>  LR: What types of families do you  work with and how do you help them? </strong></p><p> MW: I work with many different types of families &ndash; no two families are the same.  Most often the families I work with are in a state of transition.  They may be passing on wealth to the next generation, they may have a charitable foundation that isn&rsquo;t working as well as it could or they may be transitioning a business to the rising generation.  All of these present significant challenges or complex problems that can spark a lot of familial anxiety.  Anxious families are often brittle, they display the normal responses to anxiety &ndash; fight, flight, flock, freeze and fix.  (Flocking is seeking emotional support and building coalitions and fixing is that knee-jerk move to action that often makes problems worse).</p><p> My model for working with families is to &ldquo;walk beside &ndash; leave behind.&rdquo;   This means that I am with a family for a time, helping first to bring clarity to a situation, calm the system down, and then work to build skills and competencies that enable the family to develop to their capacity.  Typically, this is a 3-5 year process. The problem I am called in to solve is almost never the real problem. Therefore, the goal is not to solve a problem, but to equip the family so that it can solve today&rsquo;s issue and also ensure that it stands ready to face problems of tomorrow.</p><p> If I can leave a family with the skills to navigate the inevitable issues that will arise, I will have done my work well.  This takes time and effort on the part of the family &ndash; and not all families are cut out for it &ndash; but for those that are, it is emotionally and financially rewarding.  It is not about singing kumbaya &ndash; the process walks the harder edges of preserving and growing wealth and forging an approach that satisfies all stakeholders.  Just as corporations have found that culture is critical to high performance, in families, culture has tangible ROI in the form of long-term financial viability and, in rare cases, economic growth over generations. Preserving and growing wealth is not simply a matter of getting the right legal and succession structures, but has everything to do with the skills and competencies of the people in the system.  It is not as much about planning as it is about preparation. I find particularly that patriarchs and matriarchs may resist some of these changes at the outset, but over time they gain great peace in knowing that their family will be just fine without them because of the skills they have gained.</p><p> <strong>  LR: How is a family like a tribe? </strong></p><p> MW: Families are tribal.  Too often family consultants treat their client families as though they are corporations &ndash; they instruct them to create mission statements, do values clarification exercises and generate governance structures that are borrowed mostly from corporate contexts.  In my experience, virtually none of this works.  It is a waste of time and, worse, it causes families to grow cynical when they see it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p> Families are based on marriages, child-rearing, divorces, deaths, anniversaries, common history together and so on.  They are kinship systems. From anthropologists we know that in kinship systems, stories, rituals, wise elders, councils and gatherings are critical to the health of the tribe. Families create meaning for themselves out of these sorts of experiences.</p><p> In the United States, families of wealth tend to follow three paths in the generations after the creation of the wealth: separation, preservation and growth.  Separation is the cultural norm.  Individuals split off from their families and go their separate ways.  The problem in wealthy families is that legal structures designed to avoid taxes force the family to move in a countercultural direction &ndash; preservation of wealth requires a kind of cooperation that an ordinary modern family simply doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with.  The paths of Preservation and Growth both require that a family of wealth act like a tribe &ndash; it must gain a sense of tribal cohesion for it to be successful.  Without that sense of tribal connection, wealth lasts only for a generation or two.  With it, wealth can endure and even grow for many generations.</p><p> Reaching 100 years as a family is how we define greatness.  Families that make it that long (for more than three generations) are doing so based on cultural work &ndash; the family has learned to function as tribe.  The path of Growth absolutely requires a working culture.  The path of Preservation, if it is to endure through a second or third generation, must learn this as well. The costs of cultural failure are high &ndash; entitlement, family strife and wasted human and economic potential. Creating tribal identity and becoming an effective tribe helps to minimize, control or even eliminate these consequences.</p><p> <strong>  LR: Here at Paragon Road we stress to clients the importance of creating a positive and open family narrative. What&rsquo;s your best tip(s) for building a positive family narrative? </strong></p><p> MW: Let me begin by saying that every family faces challenges.  While I have seen my share of &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; families (fraught with chemical dependency and real abuse), my sense is that the vast majority of families are simply dealing with very complex problems as best they can.  They are not so much &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; as they are socially complex. Social complexity arises from bringing people who have very different perspectives, personalities and agendas together to solve tough problems when outcomes are inherently uncertain.  This first step of reframing &ldquo;dysfunction&rdquo; as complexity is helpful for many families &ndash; they move from a story of themselves as &ldquo;broken&rdquo; or &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; to one in which they are a group of passionate, well-meaning people dealing with difficult problems who need to work together to meet their common challenges. This is what a good story does &ndash; it reframes and thus changes the narrative from one of brokenness to one of empowerment.</p><p> The best family stories I know are the ones that see the family &ndash; and its individual members &ndash; in some form of what Joseph Campbell called the &ldquo;hero&rsquo;s journey.&rdquo;  In the hero&rsquo;s journey, a likable and relatable hero is called from his or her normal existence to face a daunting challenge.  The hero heeds the call and moves through circumstances of real difficulty and even darkness to arrive at a place of great reward.  The hero then returns to the ordinary world transformed and ready to help others.  This is the classic plot of every successful story whether it be a drama or comedy (And doesn&rsquo;t life consist of a little bit of both?). If everyone in the family is someone that faces challenges and overcomes them &ndash; with the help and support of one another &ndash; some key messages are instilled.  People see that adversity is normal, that wealth will not protect them from the normal trials of being human and that indeed the best parts of oneself have little to do with wealth. Rather, wealth helps to free a person to find and express their potential not substitute for it. They also understand that while wealth can be given, making meaning&mdash; found by building competence and connection. They cannot go at it alone. There are companions on the journey, whether these are family members, friends or trusted advisors.  They learn that triumph in life involves some degree of service to the world &ndash; creating something of value for others as well as for oneself.</p><p> In the end, the truly great story narratives of wealth are initially forged in the creation of that wealth but also in subsequent generations and in dealing with the brute fact of wealth in heroic ways.  Every family that endures has within it a family of champions who are committed to remaining together as a family (and accessing the skills to pull it off). Nathan Rothschild said, &ldquo;It takes a great deal of wit to create a great fortune, and twice as much to keep it.&rdquo;  I have found that to be true in the families I advise.</p><p> <strong>  LR: How can people overcome a  bad family dynamic in relationship to  money or passing on their businesses? </strong></p><p> MW: I mentioned before that there are three basic pathways: separation, preservation and growth.  In some families, the natural move is toward separation.  When a family is artificially held together by businesses or trusts, often the question is how to help that family separate without doing great inter-personal and economic damage.  Many people think that I want to keep families together. Although that is often the ideal outcome, it is not always practical or possible.  In those cases, I try to help the family find ways to preserve value as they find a path toward ending well.</p><p> Families can opt for another path altogether&mdash;toward Preservation or Growth.  In cases of family business, this is often a culture problem.  For example, in G1 to G2 transitions, the business and the family constitute two different systems.  The business is based on a culture of performance whereas the family is a culture of inclusion. Each has its own operating software.  When it comes time to transition, these cultures collide.  The family must navigate this crash of cultures.  For example, in the business culture, promotion and salary are based on merit.  The family culture would say something different&mdash;perhaps that family members should be given positions for which they are not qualified for or for which they are paid more than markets would pay.</p><p> The role of an outside consultant is to tease these cultures apart &ndash; to make the family the family and the business the business.  This involves role negotiation, principles of engagement, creating different ways of thinking and educating family members to the varying roles of governance, management, ownership and family membership.  It also involves forging common purpose in ways that meet the varying needs of family members.</p><p> With families of wealth, the challenges are different.  Here the modeling behavior of the parents is critical.  So too is the management of their anxieties about their children and how they use money to &ldquo;soothe and smooth&rdquo; the ordinary challenges their children face. To mature and grow, people need to face challenges and overcome them. This builds character and skill sets necessary to &ldquo;wear wealth well.&rdquo;  To be successful, children in wealthy families must learn not only how money works, but also how wealth works.  They must learn how to work with their siblings and cousins &ndash; even if they don&rsquo;t particularly like them &mdash; and understand the world of business and how to be wise philanthropists.</p><p> This is a tall order. It is not driven by the kinds of middle-class values that create wealth.  It requires a different set of skills &ndash; skills of self-awareness, self-discipline, stewardship and collaboration. Children raised in wealth are often not well-served by the values that created wealth. In one family I worked with, it was suggested by a previous financial advisor that my client would want her daughter to learn how to work hard and apply herself in a career.  The wise matriarch said, &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand, I want my daughter to become an excellent heiress.&rdquo;</p><p> She went on to say that this meant that her daughter would steward her wealth wisely and humbly, would be committed to making the world a better place, would carry the family reputation with dignity and care as a civic leader, and would raise her children to be worthy stewards as well.  If she wanted to work for her fulfillment, then that was good, but that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary since the primary purpose of a career is to earn a living and that was not an issue for her.  She noted that to pretend otherwise was to deny the reality of the situation and leave her daughter unprepared for the life she would lead. This was a woman who had made peace with her wealth and had recognized that the game had fundamentally and radically changed for her daughter.</p><p> <strong>  LR: What would you say the biggest mistake you see in wealthy families? </strong></p><p> MW: In families new to wealth &mdash; first generation families &mdash; there is the belief that planning is the same as preparation.  There are many advisors that will help a family plan, but all too often there is a massive gap between planning and execution.  I call this gap &ldquo;The Chasm.&rdquo; As my good friend, Tom Rogerson, says, &ldquo;Often there is great care put into preparing the money for the family, but virtually no work put into preparing the family for the money.&rdquo;  Without preparation, the money can become a powerfully destructive force.  Preparing the family is partially about preparing individuals in the family to understand both how money works and how wealth works (and these are two distinct things).  It is also about creating family cohesion so that the family can work together.  Preparation is about creating a strong, vibrant family culture.  Failure to build culture summons failure.  Building a family culture sets the table for success.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 20:56:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 20:56:04.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_oUItxYE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-family-dynamics-affects-wealth-transfer/\", \"post_id\": \"11202\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 20:56:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 20:56:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-family-dynamics-affects-wealth-transfer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11201\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5477\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-Family-Dynamics-Affects-Wealth-Transfer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"624\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463734800,"author_id":294,"chart_url":""}

In the classroom, if we divide 125 M&amp;Ms equally among the class so each child has 5 M&amp;Ms, everyone is equally happy. If we ask who wants to trade their M&amp;Ms, no hands go up. But if we introduce new information, the game changes. Tell a class of third graders that blue M&amp;Ms are guaranteed to make them run faster, and suddenly there&rsquo;s a run on the market. When the kids are asked to trade candy this time, what happens? Suddenly the balance between supply and demand has changed. Everyone wants blue M&amp;Ms and for this reason they now have greater market value than before. What changed that value? In this case, it was the introduction of new information. And, of course, as demand increases, so does price. One blue M&amp;M may now fetch the price of two or three M&amp;Ms of another color.</p><p> Since the average mix of M&amp;Ms includes only a 10% allocation to blue M&amp;Ms, they&rsquo;re already a bit scarce. If we then ask everyone who has one of the blue M&amp;Ms to eat one, we&rsquo;ve decreased the supply of blue M&amp;M&rsquo;s from 12 down to just six. Supply has now decreased significantly, demand has likely remained at least constant, and the price of blue M&amp;Ms has thus increased yet again. </p><p> The exact same behavior is true of stocks. When demand outpaces supply, and there are more willing to buy than able to sell at a current price, price must rise. </p><h3> Step #2: Introduce Relative Strength Calculation</h3><p> <br/> When evaluating stocks (or any other investment asset), determining the relative strength of that stock (meaning its strength compared to other stocks) is no more complicated than our example of handing out M&amp;Ms. It&rsquo;s a basic equation that even our third graders can perform:</p><li> Take the current value of the stock and divide it by the value of an Index (such as the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index).</li><li> Multiply that number by 100 (just to get a bigger number to work with).</li><li> The solution gives you the &ldquo;relative strength value&rdquo; of the stock compared to the rest of the market.  <br/>  </li><p> Here&rsquo;s the equation: Stock / Index  X  100 = Relative Strength Value <br/>        <br/> When we handed out M&amp;Ms to the kids, we made blue M&amp;Ms more valuable by giving them a desirable trait (anything that makes a third grader run faster is surely a market winner!). The resulting run on the market was perhaps more emotional than it was logical. When managing stock investments, both logic and discipline become vital. Using the Relative Strength Calculation, we&rsquo;re seeking to remove emotion from the process and give each stock a real, tangible value relative to the market as a whole.</p><p> Still, on its own that number doesn&rsquo;t mean a whole lot. It&rsquo;s just a number after all. But it&rsquo;s an increasingly important number when we bring it life by plotting its progression on a Point and Figure Relative Strength Chart.</p><h3> Step #3: Introduce the Point &amp; Figure Chart</h3><p> <br/> By plotting a stock&rsquo;s Relative Strength Calculation on a point &amp; figure chart, we&rsquo;re able to bring it to life and make it usable. Again, it&rsquo;s an exercise even our third graders can accomplish with ease.</p><p> A Point &amp; Figure chart offers a logical, organized method for recording price. Why is this important? Because as we saw with the M&amp;Ms, imbalances in supply and demand drive movements in price. Once we determine which way a price is trending, so too we determine whether it is demand or supply controlling the price discovery process.  </p><p> A Point &amp; Figure chart includes columns that consist of a series of stacked Xs or Os. Xs are used to illustrate a rising price. Os illustrate a falling price. If the price of a stock is increasing (as indicated by a series of Xs), that gives us the signal to buy. If the price of the stock is decreasing (as indicated by a series of Os), it gives us the signal to sell. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the stock is, how much we&rsquo;ve heard about how great a company&rsquo;s products are, what analysts are predicting for its next quarter growth, or whether we&rsquo;re emotionally attached to the stock.  What matters is price.</p><p> When we employ that same Point &amp; Figure charting method to record a relative strength value, we can illustrate which stocks have greater momentum than the market surrounding it at any given moment. Again, nothing matters except the stock&rsquo;s relative strength&mdash;and which way it is moving&mdash;compared to the rest of the market.</p><p> Objects in motion tend to stay in motion until acted upon by an opposing force.  This physical law has been shown to carry a certain financial truth to it as well.  Stocks that have begun trends of outperformance versus the market, tend to continue to outperform in the future.  Numerous studies over the past 20+ years have shown Relative Strength (also known as momentum) to be a robust return factor that can be used to generate market beating returns over time by systematically identifying and adopting those trends.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/point-figure.png\" width=\"407\"/></p><h3> Step #4: Introduce Smart Beta</h3><p> <br/> Our approach to building Smart Beta ETFs (or Exchange Traded Funds) is to systematically apply the signals generated by Point &amp; Figure Relative Strength analysis unemotionally. What makes these ETFs &ldquo;smart&rdquo; is simply that price, the net result of all supply and demand forces within the market place, is the primary factor used to select assets in these funds. Using today&rsquo;s technology, we&rsquo;re able to calculate each asset&rsquo;s relative strength, plot it on a Point &amp; Figure chart, and identify any buy or sell signals. Whether we&rsquo;re evaluating stocks, bonds, commodities, foreign currencies, or other assets, the market gives us everything we need to make smart choices. Trends in the market tend to last for some time and Point &amp; Figure Relative Strength provides a process to identify those trends.  The ETF structure offers a medium for enacting that information and putting it on your doorstep&mdash;in the form of a Smart Beta ETF. </p><p> By applying Smart Beta concepts in the real world, it&rsquo;s much easier for clients to gain a better understanding&mdash;and much greater confidence&mdash;in this alternative investment vehicle. The best part: even your least technically-minded clients (third graders on up!) will finally be able to appreciate the making of Smart Beta ETFs.</p><p> <i>  To learn more about Smart Beta ETFs and the Dorsey Wright Relative Strength strategies, download the whitepaper </i> <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/Point_Figure?source=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <i>   Point &amp; Figure Relative Strength Signals  </i> </a> <i>  or contact </i> <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/GIG_ContactUs?source=OtherWebsite&amp;sd=IRIS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <i>   Dorsey Wright  </i> </a> <i>  .

{"original_id":5261,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Think About This: Do You Sell or Do You Influence?","link":"think-about-this-do-you-sell-or-do-you-influence","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The Evolution of the Art of Selling/Influencing</h3><p> <br/> Selling has gone through a natural evolution, and is still evolving to this day.  There is a better way.  Sales has become somewhat of an art form, and the sooner more sales-folks realize that there is a better way, the better.    In fact, we no longer sell&hellip; rather we shouldn&rsquo;t.  This is the information age.  We should influence. </p><p> Think about the last time you bought a car versus the first time you bought a car.  The first time you went from lot to lot, talking to the sales people, test-driving a dozen cars, and narrowing down your search based mostly on the information your sales-guy gave you.  That&rsquo;s how we were able to gain knowledge and information at that time.  That&rsquo;s why cold-calling and foot canvassing worked.</p><p> Now think about the last time you bought a car.  What was the first action you took?  I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say that you googled it.  You probably looked at reviews, blue book value, etc. all on-line.  The research was at your fingertips because that&rsquo;s where information is today &ndash; it&rsquo;s at all of our fingertips.</p><p> So if you want to be in the game, you have to evolve with the game.  Evolve or dissolve.  What do you think anyone today does before they meet you, whether it&rsquo;s business or personal or other?  They google you, they google your company, they search you out and they will find you.  Or will they?  And what will they find?  Are you a thought leader?  Are you differentiating yourself?  Do you need reputation management?  These are all relevant questions.  What will I find when I google you before our next meeting?  Do you take care of your digital footprint and are you impactful?  Will I want to do business with you?  Or will your digital footprint convince me that I don&rsquo;t?  How are you influencing my decision?</p><h3> Here is a rough estimation of the evolution timeline:</h3><li> In the beginning of human history, people bartered.</li><li> Around 5000 B.C. metal objects were introduced as money&hellip;</li><li> 1700&rsquo;s &ndash; 1800&rsquo;s The Industrial Revolution changed sales yet again. Sales people were coined with the term &ldquo;snake oil salesman&rdquo; as they often made exaggerated claims in an effort to increase profits &ndash; or maybe it was just because they couldn&rsquo;t google things back then!</li><li> 1886, Pyramid Selling came into play. Identify key decision makers and use them to introduce to other prospects and your ideal client profile.</li><li> Early 1900&rsquo;s it became the responsibility of sales people to start earning the customer&rsquo;s trust.</li><li> 1916 the 1st World Salesman Congress gathered in Detroit, MI. Enter trust based selling.</li><li> 1916, there was also the methodology of scientific selling &ndash; salesmen used their knowledge to bludgeon buyers and took control of the call early on and directed the sales interaction.</li><li> 1920&rsquo;s Mood Selling stepped in &ndash; salesmen used emotion to persuade customers to buy and would even bring their children along to emotionally &ldquo;blackmail prospects&rdquo;.</li><li> 1925, Brand Based Selling controlled the sales interaction. Using publicity for a brand to prove success then used the popularity of the brand as evidence of success.</li><li> 1930, Psychological Selling was used to learn what makes buyers tick and leveraged pseudo psychological jargon to confuse buyers.</li><li> 1936 Dale Carnegie published the sales person bible &ndash; the &ldquo;must read&rdquo; for all sales people &ndash; &lsquo;How to Win Friends and Influence People&rdquo;. To this day, this book continues to have a lasting impact in sales.</li><li> 1940&rsquo;s, the methodology was a Tell-Sell process &ndash; overwhelming clients with information and leading clients to a commitment.</li><li> 1950&rsquo;s, the methodology was to ADAPT. There were no firm guidelines and salesmen were taught to follow their instincts in order to control the sale.</li><li> 1950&rsquo;s into the 60&rsquo;s, foot canvassing was born. Salesmen knocked door to door selling features and benefits.  But this was a good thing as this is how we received our information at that time &ndash; sales people brought the information right to our doorsteps &ndash; whether they were our personal doorsteps or our businesses.  Again &ndash; we couldn&rsquo;t just google back then.  This was also the time of canned presentations and customers were all treated the same, each salesman armed with a large pool of ways to handle objections &ndash; there was an answer for everything.</li><li> 1968, Needs Satisfaction Selling guided salesmen though a 7-step process to uncover the needs and introduce benefits.</li><li> Strategic Selling: In the 1970&rsquo;s the customer became much more involved in the sales process. There was a situation which led to a problem, which led to the implication, which led to the need.  Salespeople used their in-depth knowledge of the product or service and the market.  Telemarketing came into play.</li><li> 1980&rsquo;s, Solution Selling or Consultative Selling was the answer. The salesman would align a solution with a customer need, then actually prove why it was better that the competitor. Salespeople used in-depth questioning techniques to understand their prospect&rsquo;s pain and then consult in an effort to open the eyes of the buyer.</li><li> 1990&rsquo;s&hellip;. aaaahhhh the rise of partnerships. Do you remember ABC?  Always Be Closing.  This was power-based selling, target account selling&hellip; the complex sale or strategic selling.</li><li> 1997, Mobile Commerce services were first delivered, when the first two mobile-phone enabled Coca Cola vending machines were installed in Helsinki.</li><li> In the early 2000&rsquo;s there was a shift in power from the sales person to the customer. Total buyer empowerment&hellip; the rise of CRM&rsquo;s.</li><li> 2011, Challenger Sales exploded on the scene. Salespeople were ready to debate and challenge the prospect, introduce new ideas, and manipulate prospects.</li><h3> That brings us to today.  </h3><p> <br/> Today it is about influencing, not selling.  It&rsquo;s about helping the buyer make an informed decision.  We are in the age of the informed client/customer.  Information is literally at everyone&rsquo;s fingertips.  It is the rise of intelligent sales automation that works with any sales process.  We no longer receive information from cold calls or salesmen that come a knocking.  We simply search on our phones, tablets, computers, smart watches, and all things digital that are plugged into the world wide web.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget about the cornerstone &hellip; relationships.  You have to earn the trust of your network.  Relationships are intertwined throughout all of the stages of influencing. Be genuine and build your business the right way.</p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-19 22:08:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-19 22:08:03.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_JHKeMjU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/think-about-this-do-you-sell-or-do-you-influence/\", \"post_id\": \"11207\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-19 22:08:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-19 22:08:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"think-about-this-do-you-sell-or-do-you-influence\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11206\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5479\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Think-About-This-Do-You-Sell-or-Do-You-Influence.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"551\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463763600,"author_id":289,"chart_url":""}

Now, I hope you are smiling. Odds are, however, that you just twitched in anger from remembering the long hold time, the frustration of dealing with a customer rep who was reading off a script instead of speaking with you, and the annoyance of being put on hold and transferred from one agent (who didn&rsquo;t want to deal with you) to another. Now, based on this experience, how likely are you to refer them business? Probably not very likely. More than that, White House Office of Customer Affairs shows that you&rsquo;ll probably talk about your negative experience with anywhere from 9-13 people. OUCH!</p><h3> So, satisfying clients is good for your reputation. But, what does it have to do with sales?</h3><p> <br/> McKinsey statistics show us that 70% of buying experiences are based on how the customer feels they are being treated. So, if you are simply chasing after new business and then not satisfying your clients, you aren&rsquo;t just hurting your reputation, you&rsquo;re stunting your company&rsquo;s expansion. Too many of us have been brainwashed into thinking that, as business owners, our sole purpose is to bring in new business. </p><p> Newsflash: If you reduced your sales activity by just 30% and devoted that time and money to satisfying current clients, you would be receiving easy referrals, establishing yourself as a leader in your industry, and cultivating loyalty among current clients. Bain &amp; Company statistics show that a 5% reduction in customer defection can increase profits by 25-95%.</p><h3> So, why are you exhausting yourself by constantly chasing new business?</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t Feel Bad. No One Told Me About The Kool-Aid, Either. In a culture that breeds consumerism, our natural impulse is to always want more. We&rsquo;ve been taught that once we acquire something, it usually loses value right away. And, the best course of action is to get a new shiny object instead and throw out the old one. Think of the last mobile phone you purchased. Was it because you &ldquo;needed&rdquo; it, or because you wanted it? We use the exact same methodology on our clients. We get a client, pass them off to someone else, or simply put them on the back burner, then go out and look for more business.</p><p> Experiment: For the next week, instead of spending time at meetings trying to get new business, schedule calls or meetings with your current clients. Spend the time making them feel special and looked after.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-21 21:53:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-21 21:53:45.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_jPZvNlC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-satisfying-current-clients-can-be-the-best-sales-tactic/\", \"post_id\": \"11211\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-21 21:53:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-21 21:53:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-satisfying-current-clients-can-be-the-best-sales-tactic\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11210\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5484\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-Satisfying-Current-Clients-Can-Be-The-Best-Sales-Tactic.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1106\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463994000,"author_id":134,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5264,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways to Avoid Generational Warfare","link":"5-ways-to-avoid-generational-warfare","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In the next decade, billions of dollars in assets will be passed onto the children and grandchildren of baby boomers.</h3><p> <br/> In parallel to this wealth shift is a generational shift in the advisory firm workplace as millennial advisors enter the wealth management business. How to successfully manage the generational mix with different priorities, attitudes, communication styles and work ethics? The answer lies within understanding each other&rsquo;s needs.</p><p> At this point, members of the workforce typically fall into one of three categories:</p><li> <strong>  Boomers: </strong>  Born between 1946 and 1964, Boomers represent a large portion of the retiring workforce. They are also the most sizable generation, amounting to 76 million, with attitudes and values shaped by events such as the Vietnam War and Space Exploration. They&rsquo;re socially conscious, with a tendency to see possibility and opportunity.</li><li> <strong>  Gen X: </strong>  Born between 1965 and 1980, with about 55 million of them in the U.S., Generation X represents three in four government workers, and about three in five private wage and salary workers. It is the smallest of the generations in the workforce and is bookended by two generations that have been thoroughly studied. This generation has been shaped by events such as the rise of mass media and personal electronics, as well as the end of the Cold War.</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/stop-telling-millennials-get-lawn/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <strong>   Millennials  </strong> </a> <strong>  . </strong>  Born between 1981 and 1997, and with 66 million members, the fastest-growing segment of the workforce, forming 25 percent of the workforce now and slated to be 50 percent of the workforce by 2020. This generation was &ldquo;born digital&rdquo; and has attitudes shaped by events such as 9/11. <br/>  </li><p> To be sure, everyone is an individual, and just because a trait is common throughout a generation doesn&rsquo;t mean it always applies to a specific person. That said, there are a number of stereotypes that do tend to apply to the specific groups:</p><li> <strong>  Working space.  </strong> Because Millennials are used to being in constant contact, they prefer open, collaborative workspaces. Gen Xers prefer having their own offices, with the size and d&eacute;cor being a status symbol.</li><li> <strong>  Work location.  </strong> Millennials are used to using smartphones and other portable devices anywhere. Gen Xers prefer working in an office so they can be with their coworkers.</li><li> <strong>  Communications modes.  </strong> Millennials prefer the immediacy and brevity of email, instant messaging, and texting. Gen Xers feel that building a quality relationship involves spending time together in person, and being able to read body language.</li><li> <strong>  Work rewards.  </strong> Millennials prefer learning and development, flexibility and time off, and only then cash. In fact, they&rsquo;re willing to take unpaid time off. Gen Xers prefer the cash, both for merit and for seniority.</li><li> <strong>  Motivation </strong> . Millennials want to have constant feedback, education, and new opportunities. While Gen Xers are motivated by status and title, they also want to feel they&rsquo;ve made an impact.</li><li> <strong>  Hours worked.  </strong> Millennials tend to feel that they should get their work done in 40 hours&mdash;or less if they&rsquo;re efficient. Gen Xers, being interested in spending time with people and in the office, may spend 40 to 60 hours per week in the office, as well as being available on-call after hours.</li><li> <strong>  Authority </strong> . While both groups respect authority, Millennials tend to focus on what they can learn from them, while Gen Xers respect their status. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s not like either of these groups and their preferences is better than the other. But problems can occur when the two groups come into conflict over one or more of these areas.</p><p> So what are some ways companies can bridge the gap and make both generations happy? (As well as the outliers in either generation who may feel differently?)</p><li> <strong>  Give employees the opportunity to exchange a cash bonus for vacation time </strong> .</li><li> <strong>  Rotate jobs </strong> . This is a win-win for both generations: Millennials get more learning, and Gen Xers get more status.</li><li> <strong>  Standardize communications channels, such as by using  </strong> <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/ecmblog/3-electronic-forms-that-have-a-huge-payoff/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <strong>   electronic forms  </strong> </a> <strong>  , rather than relying on one form of communication over another </strong> . When everyone is submitting the same form, it removes the possibility of confusion over communication method, style and tone. E-forms help control and route common requests, which ensures approvals occur quickly.</li><li> <strong>  Determine which functions must be performed in the office, which can be performed elsewhere, and which employee roles can work more flexibly </strong> . Before offering BYOD privileges, it is important to set up secure mobile access to internal systems. For instance,  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/ecmblog/what-is-enterprise-content-management-ecm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  enterprise content management </a>  (ECM) systems offer a wide range of  <a href=\"http://www.laserfiche.com/SolutionExchange/Article/best-practices-in-laserfiche-mobile-security\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  functionality </a> to ensure that once the employee finishes accessing privileged information, all data is cleared from his personal device and he is logged out of the session.</li><li> <strong>  Have Gen Xers mentor Millennials </strong> . The Millennials get to learn, while the Gen Xers get to create impact. <br/>  </li><p> And don&rsquo;t forget to use technology. Millennials default to &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; broken processes, an attitude that can come across as disruptive unless it&rsquo;s properly channeled. Encourage millennials to  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/resource/ebook-diagram-business-process/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  diagram business processes </a>  to ensure they are as simple, logical and consistent as possible, then let them work with organizational stakeholders to translate them into  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/ecmblog/what-is-business-process-automation-bpa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  automated workflows </a> . Cutting out the busywork associated with expense report submission, invoice and purchase approval, travel request submission and contract approval is one way to support efficient-minded millennials that will satisfy overwhelmed Gen Xers, too.</p><p> Such programs can also help attract Millennials to your company&mdash;an  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/with-boomers-retiring-where-are-the-millennials/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  increasingly important factor as Boomers retire </a> . Studies from PwC, such as  <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/services/consulting/documents/millennials-at-work.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Millennials at Work: Reshaping the Workplace </a> , have shown that the potential for their own personal development was the factor that most influenced 65 percent of Millennials&rsquo; choice of a job, the single largest factor. And 64 percent said they have a priority to make the world a better place.  So programs that accentuate these wishes make your company more attractive to them.</p><p> And by the way, don&rsquo;t discount those Boomers. The computer industry has been criticized for  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/why-tech-industry-needs-deal-its-ageism-problem/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ageism </a>  by believing that people over a certain age&mdash;sometimes as low as 35&mdash;are no longer capable of working in IT. While they may not know the hottest and newest programming techniques, they often have a  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/do-programmers-need-be-masters-their-domain/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  vast institutional memory </a>  about the industry and your company&rsquo;s field that transcends knowing one particular tool. By recognizing the skills and needs of the diverse workforce, employers will have to continually adapt talent strategies and operations to attract talent that can work together.</p><p> <strong>  Looking for ways to get Gen Xers and Millennials to work together?

{"original_id":5265,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What to Do If Your Subject Matter Expert Isn't a Leader","link":"what-to-do-if-your-subject-matter-expert-isnt-a-leader","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I have a client who is the business manager for a technology firm &ndash; a well-known company recognized for being cool and on the cutting edge of innovative thinking. The firm is filled with subject matter experts highly regarded in the industry. These experts speak at conferences. They are regularly published in multiple articles on a variety of topics. They are sought after for television interviews. From the outside &ndash; everything looks amazing. But what bothers my client &ndash; is that their teams accomplish hardly anything of significance.</p><p> It is an issue prevalent in the technology and digital spaces - but I see it often in various aspects of an organization, regardless of industry. Highly sought-after subject matter experts get paid many zeros to join a firm. They &ldquo;think differently&rdquo; and have these great and wonderful ideas, which gets them internal and external praise. However, at the end of the day &ndash; they are incapable of getting a team to execute on these ideas. The company then spends many more zeros on management and leadership training and coaching. Rinse. Repeat.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not OK.</p><h3> It should be so easy</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s tempting to promote subject matter experts to leadership positions. Shouldn&rsquo;t finding a leader be this easy? After all, they are the experts! They are highly visible and have great ideas! They have specialized skills! It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that while SMEs are well-stacked in a particular technical skill set, leadership is not a technical skill. Don&rsquo;t let the fact that a person is a strong SME hide the fact that they are a terrible leader. <a href=\"http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/a-quarter-of-bosses-have-destructive-leadership-style/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  They will do more damage than good </a> .</p><h3> One of these things is not like the other &hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Leader, manager and subject matter expert are not synonymous. They all have places in business, but by definition are very different things. First, there is a significant distinction between leaders and managers. Both are needed to be successful and both include teams, however as a matter of function they differ.</p><p> Outside of leadership and management comes the subject matter expert. If it isn&rsquo;t evident already, being an expert in a particular field has absolutely nothing to do with the ability to effectively lead or manage a group of individuals. In fact, especially in digital and tech, <a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/article/2700350/careers/moving-from-subject-matter-expert-to-technical-lead.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the move from SME to management should be a conscious decision </a> , as they are completely different skill sets.</p><h3> You still need your expert</h3><p> <br/> None of this is to deter you from hiring a subject matter expert. They are the idea generators. They have experience in the field. They certainly bring their value and they are needed.</p><p> However, like any good relationship, a dialogue needs to open between organization and expert. Why is the expert needed? Is the focus on accomplishing something new or educating and leading a team? Some experts have no desire to run a team. And that&rsquo;s OK! The expert could be a leader AND an individual contributor.

Generally speaking each of us has about two hundred days a year that are available for client-facing activities. As a person who has always been a bit of an over-achiever, I have constantly thought about how to get the most out of each of those days. I&rsquo;m also one of those people that doesn&rsquo;t work well when my desk is cluttered with all the things that I don&rsquo;t need to actually do today! So here&rsquo;s what I do.</p><p> I start with a meticulously kept calendar: one that is electronic, and one that is a paper printout. I also carry a journal with me everywhere I go. I also have a &lsquo;bring-forward&rsquo; filing system in a drawer that is equipped with twelve folders for the months of the year and thirty-one daily folders.

{"original_id":5269,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Power of Technology in Insurance","link":"the-power-of-technology-in-insurance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Writing for the New York Times in 2013, &ldquo;Wealth Matters&rdquo; columnist Paul Sullivan  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/your-money/technologys-impact-on-the-value-of-financial-advice.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  posed </a>  a number of questions about the  <a href=\"https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/03/03/meet-the-social-networking-site-built-exclusively/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  use of technology </a> . Would it replace advisors &mdash; or help them do their job better? And what does it mean for their clients &mdash; &ldquo;the people whose money is at stake?&rdquo;Writing for the Wall Street Journal in early 2015, Jane Hodges tackled the topic of  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-find-a-financial-adviser-1420516873\" target=\"_blank\">  Brains, Bots or Both? </a>  Hodges notes that technology can help advisors and their clients with certain aspects of managing money, but humans bring unique skills and insights, and &ldquo;people still like the human touch.&rdquo; Robo-advice and hybrid models may be gaining momentum, but not surprisingly she concludes that advisors are &ldquo;not going extinct any time soon.&rdquo;Technology  <a href=\"https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/02/27/the-insurance-company-of-the-future-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  eliminates barriers to growth </a> , allowing advisors to streamline their workflow and create efficiencies. More importantly, today&rsquo;s technology tools can allow advisors to enhance their capabilities and optimize the human capital needed to maintain a successful practice. This gives advisors real power to focus on strategic relationship building and customized solutions, to better serve their current clients &mdash; and to bring on new clients &mdash; in today&rsquo;s highly competitive market.</p><h3> Technology to evolve the advisor&rsquo;s profession</h3>Through the use of technology, the advisor&rsquo;s profession has progressed, and continues to evolve. Technology helps re-engineer every step of the advising and investing process. It also empowers advisors with capabilities to analyze and understand the state of a client&rsquo;s assets more accurately than ever before.In an industry once known for spreadsheets, number crunching, and manual processes, new technologies support more sophisticated planning, specialized portfolio construction and advanced risk management techniques. For the analytical tools needed to manage today&rsquo;s complex market dynamics, advisors can leverage financial planning solutions such as MoneyGuidePro and eMoney. To minimize any margin of error when reconciling accounts and reporting performance, advisors can employ portfolio management systems such as Schwab PortfolioCenter, Pershing Albridge, and Advent Black Diamond.Managing client relationships has also evolved. Two decades ago, a telephone and a rolodex were the advisor&rsquo;s primary tools. Now, in today&rsquo;s environment of the 24-hour news cycle and anytime/anywhere access, the most sophisticated advisors build and maintain a strategic approach to client communications across multiple channels for relationship management, prospecting, sales and marketing. To automate administrative tasks, manage the workflow, ensure effective outreach and impactful follow-up, advisors now use technology based CRMs such as Redtail, Junxure and Grendel.As technology penetrates all aspects of an advisor&rsquo;s practice, a top priority is improving and increasing the level of technology integration according to advisors surveyed said for a whitepaper by Envestnet-Tamarac and Aite Group entitled &ldquo;RIA Productivity and Profitability: Integration Pays.&rdquo; With technology allowing greater access across all areas of a client&rsquo;s portfolio, advisors can integrate data and products from multiple sources to take a more holistic approach to planning, helping clients realize their full investment potential and reach their long-term goals.<h3> Technology to create a new category</h3>Technology not only redefines every aspect of the advisor&rsquo;s practice. It is also reshapes the products advisors use, including insurance products like variable annuities. One of the most notable examples in recent years ishow technology has helped to create an entirely new category of Investment-Only Variable Annuity (IOVA).Through automation, greater efficiencies and enhanced functionality, a costly and complex insurance product has evolved into a low-cost tax-advantaged investing platform. For decades, traditional variable annuities with income guarantees have been a popular retirement income tool, and they can have a place in a client&rsquo;s portfolio. Their appeal is based upon the combination of downside protection, upside potential and a guaranteed income stream in one investment package, with the potential for tax-deferred accumulation and liquidity of assets. But with asset-based fees that frequently exceed 2 percent or even 3 percent per year, restrictions on underlying investment options, and  insurance guarantees that can be difficult to decipher, traditional VAs have their limitations.Investment-Only VAs are a relatively new category of annuity designed to maximize the benefits of tax deferral.  Research has shown that the primary advantage to the variable annuity structure is the power of tax deferral &mdash; but it must be low cost. Just as the power of tax-deferred compounding can grow wealth, its corollary is that the drag of compounding fees can reduce wealth. Technology is the key to minimizing fees and keeping IOVA costs low. But for IOVAs to work, low cost is not enough. Functionality and flexibility are key. Technology is essential to take the traditional VA chassis and re-engineer it from the ground up, to build an IOVA that can be used for tax-advantage investing.Today&rsquo;s IOVAs utilize web-enabled functionality to support portfolio management, trading and mass transaction capabilities, allowing advisors to efficiently evaluate and employ an expanded selection of funds, including liquid alternatives that use strategies like those favored by hedge funds and elite institutional investors. Other features can include an online application process, and cloud-based account management and performance reporting. Some IOVA&rsquo;s use an efficient digital marketing approach to replace the traditional high priced commission-based wholesale model.<h3> Integration for more holistic advice</h3>Using technology for the integration of IOVAs is also critical, allowing for back office and front office connection into the advisor&rsquo;s practice. While many tax-deferred vehicles, including qualified accounts, traditional VAs and other insurance products, are generally viewed as a &ldquo;held-away&rdquo; asset, IOVAs can be designed to integrate into an advisor&rsquo;s practice and be managed alongside taxable accounts. For example, there are IOVAs that use DST FanMail, DST Vision, DTCC, and NSCC to integrate with a range of Broker-Dealer platforms, leading custodial platforms, RIA-centric platforms such as Tamarac, and rebalancing software such as iRebal. Through data feeds and direct links to advisor software and platform solutions, the IOVA becomes an everyday part of the advisor&rsquo;s investment strategy.Along with providing low cost, more choice and more flexibility, the Investment-Only VA can be used in ways that a traditional VA cannot. Built as a platform to provide a broader range of investing solutions, IOVAs can help advisors offer new ways to better meet their clients&rsquo; needs &mdash; deepening the client relationship.For example, low-cost IOVAs can be used to create more tax-alpha. By ensuring that the portfolio is fully optimized &mdash; minimizing the impact of taxes, enhancing portfolio performance and increasing accumulation &mdash; an Investment-Only VA can help maximize after-tax returns. This is done through an asset location strategy, often assisted by rebalancing software. Once the tax-efficiency of assets has been evaluated, the advisor can determine which assets should be located in taxable vehicles and which should be located in tax-deferred vehicles like an IOVA.Likewise, using low-cost IOVAs for legacy planning has become an important solution as the transfer of wealth has become a defining issue for the financial services industry. According to the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/baby-boomers-retire/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Pew Research Center</a>, roughly 10,000 Baby Boomers will turn 65 every day for the next two decades. According to Accenture , a \"Great Transfer\" of wealth &mdash; estimated at over $12 trillion &mdash; is currently taking place as these Boomers inherit wealth from their parents. And an even \"Greater Transfer\"&mdash; estimated at over $30 trillion &mdash; will occur as Boomers pass on wealth to their heirs. By tax-optimizing trusts with a low-cost IOVA, advisors can control the timing of income to minimize the tax burden. This preserves more wealth for the next generation of family members &mdash; and the next generation of clients for your firm.<h3> Driving growth in a competitive industry</h3>With the latest innovations in technology and the adoption of technology into advisors&rsquo; practices, new products such as IOVAs are making their mark on the industry. IOVAs are growing rapidly, doubling over the past two years, with sales of nearly $5 billion as of Third Quarter 2014 compared to sales of $2.4 billion as of year-end 2012.Another important trend is the growth of IOVAs built for RIAs and fee-based advisors. According to the latest Morningstar data, the channel to post the largest VA sales gains from Q3 2013 to Q4 2014 is independent investment firms and RIAs. Simple and transparent, with lower costs, more choice and no commissions, IOVAs are the right fit for RIAs and fee-based advisors. Most importantly, all advisors now have access to a new solution to optimize their investing strategies and manage the triple threat of low yields, rising taxes and ongoing volatility.In his recent <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/012815/ways-advisors-should-evolve-2015-and-beyond.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> article</a>, U.S. Military financial planner Mark Cussen writes, &ldquo;The financial planning profession is evolving at an increasingly rapid rate, and those who fail to keep up with current trends will soon be left behind.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s clear that adopting technology can increase efficiencies across all aspects of an advisor&rsquo;s practice.There is no question it can enhance an advisor&rsquo;s capabilities for sophisticated planning, specialized portfolio construction and advanced risk management. And ultimately, technology is vital to building an advisor&rsquo;s book of business and growing their practice.In a market where every basis point counts, competition for clients &mdash; especially the high net worth &mdash; continues to increase. Innovation in technology, and the new products it creates, can help you move forward to create more value for your current clients &mdash; and attract the next generation of new clients.Learn more about Jefferson National<a href=\"https://www.jeffnat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-22 10:38:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-22 10:38:47.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_3FIlXSJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-power-of-technology-in-insurance/\", \"post_id\": \"11223\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-22 10:38:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-22 10:38:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-power-of-technology-in-insurance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11222\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5490\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Power-of-Technology-in-Insurance.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1133\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464023700,"author_id":298,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5270,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: The Choice Is to Evolve With the Rest of the World or Become Irrelevant","link":"advisors-the-choice-is-to-evolve-with-the-rest-of-the-world-or-become-irrelevant","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Old folk don&rsquo;t take on new tech, right?</p><p> There is a seemingly continuous lament about the ageing of the financial advisory business and it is certainly true when you look back at photo&rsquo;s after a conference that there does appear to be an exceptionally high proportion of grey-haired middle-aged men.  It is also held that because of this ageing that there is a resistance to new technology and new ways of doing things, most noticeably when it comes to using new marketing methods, such as social media.</p><p> Yet these arguments about the aged advisers inability to handle new ways doesn&rsquo;t seem to quite fit with those same advisers being amongst the earliest adopters of the newest smartphones, tablets and home entertainment technology.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to slow down their use of new software systems, shifts to online services and purchasing, or ways of sourcing information either.  In my experience they tend to be remarkably open to finding new ways to manage and handle their business resources and systems, and are open to new ways of structuring and managing staff and human resources issues.</p><h3> So who says you can&rsquo;t teach an old dog new tricks?</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with a grey-haired adviser in the last month or so who is embracing entirely new ways of marketing himself and his business.  And he doesn&rsquo;t have to really.  He has a well-established financial planning business with 20+ years of success, and a host of happy clients.  His systems and support are good; his costs kept well under control; and the revenue very healthy.  It is a good business, and one which would be very easy to ride luxuriously into retirement.  In other words, he is like many many other advisers in the industry at present: life is relatively comfortable really.</p><p> Therein lies the real challenge to innovation in the financial services industry:  Life is actually quite comfortable for many incumbents.  Too comfortable actually.  </p><p> It is not my intent however to have a rant about salaries and perks of too many institutional managers, or challenge the remuneration systems of advisers.  Tempting&hellip;but it serves no useful purpose really.  What is useful for many advisers to understand is that their ability to take advantage of new business or marketing methods such as social media comes down to one simple, and age old, criteria: the individual advisers attitude.</p><p> It is the attitude to change&hellip;the desire to be different and to create new ways of doing things and to meet new people and to have different experiences&hellip;.&ldquo;the desire for something different&rdquo; which separates the old dogs and the young ones.  All progress in society begins with someone&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the status quo, and it is the same for advisers running their own businesses.</p><h3> Progress begins with dissatisfaction with the status quo.</h3><p> <br/> Many advisers are comfortable and fervently wish for the status quo to remain exactly that: they want the existing conditions to remain as they are.   They will be the practices which are most challenged by new advice systems and distribution methods, because the rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t stand still. It is continually evolving.  The choice is to evolve with or ahead of it, or become irrelevant.</p><p> So here is the tip for incumbent advisers who want to grow, but have found themselves well settled into a pattern of doing business which is largely unchanged for some years: shake it up.  Do some different things.  Learn some new tricks.</p><p> The planner I&rsquo;ve been working with recently doesn&rsquo;t really care in his heart of hearts whether he gets half a dozen new clients from using social media or not.  That would be nice, and it is certainly the measurable outcome for him, but it isn&rsquo;t really the thing driving the shift.  He knows that he is stagnating a little and beginning to hit the plateau, and a fresh injection of enthusiasm and zest needs to come into the practice.  Adopting social into their marketing mix is simply a way of learning something new and feeling enthusiastic and energised, and it has already worked.  It makes them look at a whole heap of other areas inside their business differently, and that leads to innovation inside the practice.  Standard communications and advice templates and processes are suddenly up for a re-think, as is the entire advice delivery model.</p><p> Trying something new &ndash; learning some new tricks &ndash; leads to innovation and evolution.  That leads to growth.  And it all begins with the advisers attitude and desire to shake themselves out of the comfort zone.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-22 10:46:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-22 10:46:31.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_SQsiqjS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-the-choice-is-to-evolve-with-the-rest-of-the-world-or-become-irrelevant/\", \"post_id\": \"11225\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-22 10:46:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-22 10:46:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-the-choice-is-to-evolve-with-the-rest-of-the-world-or-become-irrelevant\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11224\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5491\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Advisors-The-Choice-Is-to-Evolve-With-the-Rest-of-the-World-or-Become-Irrelevant.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"787\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464062400,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5273,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Problem for Research Leaders Today","link":"the-problem-for-research-leaders-today","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When I talk with research leaders across the UK (and Europe), I consistently hear some common woes.</p><h3> The problem for research leaders today</h3><p> <br/> Many feel under-utilised and almost all suggest they appear to have less influence than they had in the past.</p><p> With regard to the cause of this \"demotion,\" many cite the rise of executive interest in Big Data and Analytics. It seems that customer research is now often viewed as the poor relation to a more \"modern\" data analysis solution.</p><p> The fact that market or customer research often still sits in a department from data and analytics teams can exacerbate the problem.</p><p> Too few companies bring all these components of holistic customer insight together.</p><p> Yet, despite this apparent \"doom and gloom\" for research professionals, the wind appears to be changing in the wider marketing community. At the start of 2016, a number of data and marketing leaders were asked for  <a href=\"http://laughlinconsultancy.com/news/2016-predictions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  their predictions about key themes </a>  for the year. Many cited the need for more focus on emotion.</p><p> In this  <a href=\"https://experiencematters.wordpress.com/2016/04/21/epidemic-of-emotionless-experience-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  thought-provoking piece </a> ,  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btemkin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bruce Temkin </a>  shares the criticality of engaging with emotion when designing better customer experiences.</p><p> So, if marketers and CX leaders need to better engage with people&rsquo;s emotions and ensure communications have the emotional impact they wish, surely there will be a growing need for research skills. What might that look like in the context of the current technological change driven by Big Data and Data Science? Well, they say you often need to look to the past to predict the future. So, how about the 14th Century?</p><h3> The Renaissance</h3><p> <br/> What has a 14th century European phenomenon of major changes in culture and society got to do with research today?</p><p> As with most historical events, historians disagree as to causes of this explosion of hunger for learning and rediscovery of classical art. But many cite the invention of the printing press. In their day, this meant their very own \"information revolution.\" Suddenly, not just bibles but hundreds of classic texts could be rediscovered and put into the hands of the (richer) common people.</p><p> An interesting facet of this explosion of facts and learning, though, is it also sparked an equal focus on art and culture. There was a passion to explore what it meant to be human: from studies of the human form in Michelangelo&rsquo;s statues to the internal motivations laid bare in Machiavelli&rsquo;s \"The Prince.\"</p><p> So, what could this mean for our current information-obsessed society? Could those forecasters be right? Will we see our own resurgence of the importance of understanding our humanity and emotional expressions? Personally, I think so. Perhaps even more so as we face the rise of increasingly sophisticated machine learning and automation.</p><p> I&rsquo;m certainly looking forward to a new wave of fresh interest in research and psychological understanding of customers.</p><h3> How to ride the wave that&rsquo;s coming</h3><p> <br/> Does that mean research leaders can just relax and wait for this salvation to come galloping in to rescue them? No, of course not. Despite the renewed need for a research-led, more holistic understanding of our customers. It is also true that past approaches have been discredited. Few senior leaders still have any tolerance for sitting through hour-long debriefs, just for agencies to showcase how much work they&rsquo;ve done.</p><p> Instead, there is a need for research leaders to become trusted advisers: to proactively identify business needs and use a more holistic view to raise relevant issues and potential solutions. Partnerships will be needed (including with those data and analytics leaders who might feel more like a threat right now).</p><p> In  <a href=\"http://www.quirks.com/articles/2016/20160506.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this post published in Quirks magazine </a> , David Santee shares how research leaders need to develop multiple styles of influencing (logos, pathos and ethos).</p><p> How fitting to be focusing on advice originally taught by Aristotle, as we talk about the Renaissance and people&rsquo;s love of classical texts at that time. I&rsquo;ve also  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/how-socrates-can-help-you-get-a-better-brief/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  shared before how Socrates can help you </a>  think about your questioning as a leader, to get to the real business need.</p><h3> What next?</h3><p> <br/> So, what about you? If you are a research leader, consider these 3 questions:</p><li> Do you relate to the crisis of diminished influence mentioned at the start of this post?</li><li> Are you optimistic that a \"renaissance of research\" is coming for emotional marketing and many other planned improvements?</li><li> What are you doing to develop your skills so you are ready to \"ride that wave\" and have more influence internally? <br/>  </li><p> I hope that helped and that you protect some time to both think about this issue and invest in your own development. Tomorrow&rsquo;s business problems will surely need a renaissance in leadership within research teams, as much as a renaissance in those technical research skills.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-22 11:43:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-22 11:43:52.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_yPELE5r.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-problem-for-research-leaders-today/\", \"post_id\": \"11231\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-22 11:43:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-22 11:43:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-problem-for-research-leaders-today\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11230\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5494\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Problem-for-Research-Leaders-Today.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"348\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464030000,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5274,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Robots Against Humans Is Like Spock Against Kirk","link":"robots-against-humans-is-like-spock-against-kirk","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I was talking to a City chap this week about the Brexit vote and he felt it was clear we would leave.  I said I couldn&rsquo;t see that because there was not a single logical economic reason for leaving1.  He said that I was stupid to think of this as logical.  It&rsquo;s emotional.  The Leave campaign is all about appealing to the general voters anger over politicians, corporations, leadership and the total lack of understanding of what real people have to deal with these days.  Therefore, it was not going to be a logical vote, but an emotional one to make a point.  I asked him to clarify what he meant by this disconnection between the leaders and the people.  This led to a long discussion lamenting the way the world has moved.Disconnected from reality, he believes that politicians, corporations, regulators and banks are all just running the machine as though it were a machine these days.  His examples resonated.  Starting with the City itself, he noted how many traders were being replaced with automated trading systems.  The problem with this, he believed, is that things become disconnected from reality.  Like the fact that credit default swaps (CDS) markets ended in the financial implosion of 2008, the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) is just one example of where logic beat thinking.  Logic says that you can create bundled packages of debt that is derisked based upon the bundling.  Thinking says that if you bundle bundled debts in ever increasing circles of complexity, you end up with a giant financial Jenga.  The latter proved to be correct.  Logic says that you can package mortgages into ever greater groups of bundled debt.  Thinking says that those groups of bundled debt related to real people in real homes.We then talked about other examples, such as UK housing markets.  Logic says that there is money to be made from property.  Thinking says that if you end up with a market that price excludes most ordinary workers from the housing market, you either have to build free housing or face civil war.  That vision hasn&rsquo;t played out yet, but with the average London property price now $1 million whilst the average workers&rsquo; pay is $50,000 a year, something&rsquo;s gotta give.Corporations are run by CEOs disconnected from reality and earning 500 times the average Joe&rsquo;s pay.  When Martin Sorrell awards himself  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wpp-ceo-martin-sorrell-receives-103-million-in-compensation-for-2015-1461941572\" target=\"_blank\">  $100 million for the year </a> , something&rsquo;s gotta give. <img alt=\"\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wep-ceo-martin-sorrell.png\" width=\"616\"/> Regulators equally have no idea.   Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, has a personal net worth of at least $5 million, can he really empathise with the life of someone working on a checkout till?  Can David Cameron (net worth $50 million) empathise with the guy working the pumps at the local gas station?  And when the people controlling the economy are so dislocated from the people living in the economy, can they really connect with the people?  It is for these reasons that the likes of Bernie Saunders and Jeremy Corbyn make headway.  They seem more like one of us.The debate was a good one, covering these and more topics related to the Brexit vote on June 23.  I&rsquo;ve blogged about the Brexit vote  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2016/02/banks-bet-brexit-brings-britain-down.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  before </a> , but my colleague believes that it will be far closer than anyone expects.  I must admit, it was a slightly depressing conversation as you have to remember we live in a world where there is also the Donald Trump and the Boris Johnson&rsquo;s.  Is this the new reality?Yes, we can have bleak visions of the future, but we can also have optimistic views of the future.  As usual, that brings me back to Star Trek.  In Star Trek, Spock is ruled by his Vulcan father&rsquo;s logic.  Logic beats emotion is the Vulcan way of the world.  In the Vulcan way of the world, credit default swaps make perfect sense as does collateralised debt obligations.  In the Vulcan way of the world, 125% mortgages and self-certified mortgages work.  In the Vulcan way of the world, leaders who believe they connect with citizens through EastEnders and Coronation Street is wholly justified.The problem is that none of these things are true.  Debt on housing really exists.  Poverty in mainstream Britain is a fact of life.  High net worth citizens and corporations screwing the tax system is the way it works.The Vulcan world of Logic does not work without the Kirk world of Emotion.  Emotions temper Logic.  Emotions bring the humanity to the numbers.  Emotions are the conscience of Logic.  This is the real way in which our world works.   Emotion acts as the brakes of Logic.  Without Emotions, the Bernie Madoff&rsquo;s and Richard S. Fuld Junior&rsquo;s of this world make sense, as do the Gordon Gekko&rsquo;s and Jordan Belfort&rsquo;s.In other words, logic is not common sense.  Logic is just a way of looking at the world in theory, disconnected from reality.  That is why academics cannot be trusted.  After all, an academic is just someone who looks at something working in reality and wonders what it would look like in theory.  I would far rather work with the world of reality and, for that reason, believe that the more we automate, the more we need to check that the way we automate makes sense.  Not from a logical point of view, but from a humanist point of view.We will live in a world of artificial intelligence and robotics in the very near future.  I want that to be a world that keeps our basic humanity and doesn&rsquo;t destroy it.Anyway, apologies for today&rsquo;s perspective.  I guess I&rsquo;m just debating and reading too much.  Back to reality tomorrow.  Meantime, if you want to see an even more gloomy view of the future, I can recommend a book I&rsquo;m reading called  <a href=\"/category/wow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the Mandibles </a>  by Lionel Shriver.  Lionel predicts a future where America implodes, loses its superpower status, and the successor to bitcoin becomes the reserve currency of the world as the dollar devalues radically to almost nothing.  Really far-fetched?</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-22 13:36:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-22 13:36:18.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_mV3TaPo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/robots-against-humans-is-like-spock-against-kirk/\", \"post_id\": \"11234\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-22 13:36:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-22 13:36:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"robots-against-humans-is-like-spock-against-kirk\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11232\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5495\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Robots-Against-Humans-Is-Like-Spock-Against-Kirk.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"897\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464022800,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

Being that the event took place right in our backyard, <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gregory FCA</a> was in attendance.While many of the presenters eloquently shared their thoughts on the evolving finance industry, it was keynote speaker <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Josh Brown</a>, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ritholtzwealth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Ritholtz Wealth Management</a>, that stole the show with guidance on how to use social media to interact with the outside world.For the finance industry, the issue of engaging with the digital world is one many advisers struggle with.

In 2013, it was found that Americans spend 23 hours per week online or on their mobile phone, according to an <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4718-weekly-online-social-media-time.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> eMarketer report</a>. And the amount of time spent online is increasing every day.<h3> If you are not on LinkedIn, you might as well not exist, Brown said.</h3>To grab the attention of clients today, Brown said advisory firms must join social media, blog, tweet constantly and show personality when voicing their opinion. If you are not on LinkedIn, you might as well not exist, he said. Brown shook his head at advisers who didn&rsquo;t produce their own social media content and urged money managers to write regularly about trending market news that&rsquo;s relevant to clients.Brown is an enthusiastic speaker with a ton of great ideas. We wanted to highlight a few we feel are most actionable and beneficial to advisory firms. Below are the top three reforms that every company must make to stay ahead of the curve and become thought leaders in the 21st century:<h3> Blog, blog, blog</h3>It&rsquo;s no secret that blogging is an effective marketing tool. Businesses that blog generate 55 percent more website visitors than those that don&rsquo;t, according to <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30278/Everything-You-Need-to-Sell-Your-Boss-on-Business-Blogging.aspx#sm.00001d1t4j7bucfowudu85serl6ic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Hub Spot</a>. However, don&rsquo;t just write for the sake of writing. &ldquo;People won&rsquo;t follow you unless they get value out of your content,&rdquo; Brown said. Advisory firms must supplement their core material with relevant news, pop culture and trending topics to relate to different audiences, including some with limited interest in finance.<h3> Use Twitter as a client retention tool</h3>Clients see value in an adviser&rsquo;s active social media presence, particularly when they are reactive to industry-related news. The use of Twitter is a true differentiator for advisers, Brown said, and allows them to build trust and rapport with current and prospective clients by showing that they are engaged and constantly monitoring the landscape.<h3> Show personality</h3>Showing personality and developing a niche is an effective way to establish your social media presence and grow your following. When catering to a specific audience, it&rsquo;s integral to actively participate in debates, refine your voice and demonstrate your personal character. In return, the industry will turn to you for a hot take and you&rsquo;ll be seen as an expert. In the opaque and often difficult-to-understand world of high finance, this can really help you stand out, Brown said.With more than 140,000 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReformedBroker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Twitter followers</a> and a widely-read blog, Brown is clearly one of the most visible advisers in the industry today. Take heed to his advice or risk falling behind your competitors.This post is a collaboration between Tony and another member of the <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gregory FCA</a> team, Riana Aldana.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-22 13:52:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-22 13:52:48.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_fVILFuo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/josh-brown-advisors-join-social-media-blog-and-show-your-personality/\", \"post_id\": \"11236\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-22 13:52:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-22 13:52:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"josh-brown-advisors-join-social-media-blog-and-show-your-personality\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11235\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5496\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Josh-Brown-Advisors-Join-Social-Media-Blog-and-Show-Your-Personality.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1003\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1463994000,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5276,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seven Reasons You Should Still Be Talking about Twitter","link":"seven-reasons-you-should-still-be-talking-about-twitter","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Have you ever asked yourself if Twitter is a social media channel where you should really be investing time, or is it just a waste?</p><p> Out of all the various social channels, and coming from one who advises businesses just which channels are best for their marketing strategy, here&rsquo;s my advice:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/sell/marketing\"/></p><h3> Let&rsquo;s look at seven reasons why Twitter should be a part of your social media marketing strategy:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Number of Twitter users</h3><p> <br/> In 60 seconds, Twitter users share  <a href=\"/category/sell/social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  277,000 tweets </a> ,  There are 190 million users taking advantage Twitter each month. A surprising 43% of those don&rsquo;t send tweets themselves, but watch others&rsquo; tweet. Sheer volume. We&rsquo;re looking at a concentrated area of people, who you are able to segregate by industry and keywords.</p><h3> 2. Brevity</h3><p> <br/> There is no getting around it: short and sweet wins the game on Twitter. You have 140 characters to get your point across. No talking someone&rsquo;s ear off with lengthy copy. I suggest about 110 characters to allow those retweeting (i.e. sharing your message) room to add your Twitter handle and a short comment. The more you tweet, the better you become at whittling down your message while retaining its meaning. After all, don&rsquo;t you appreciate when someone is on point and takes up less of your precious time?</p><p> One Twitter user who is an ace at getting his point across succinctly is  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iSocialFanz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brian Fanzo </a> . His motto is &lsquo;Talk Fast, Tweet Faster&rsquo;. He does both well and adds tremendous value to those following him.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/brian-fazio-twitter.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> 3. Hashtags</h3><p> <br/> What a wonderful component of this channel! Use industry key words (e.g. #SocialMedia, #smm (social media marketing), #TravelTips, #productivity) in your tweets to help show your audience the gist of why they should be reading your message.</p><p> Tip: Search first if you&rsquo;re unsure about a specific hashtag and make sure it&rsquo;s relevant in your industry.  If no one&rsquo;s using it, you&rsquo;re less likely to get the big bang out of it. Use hashtags that are relevant and popular in your industry, and take advantage of common ground.</p><p> Another tip: Look at the trending column from your home page and see if there are any topics you can tie in with your brand&rsquo;s message &ndash; capitalize on what&rsquo;s already working!</p><h3> 4. Tweet Chats</h3><p> <br/> One of my favorite uses for Twitter are tweet chats. Think of them as meet-ups you can be a part of without actually having to drive somewhere to attend. I have met so many wonderful people through these who have helped sharpen my skills by sharing their knowledge.</p><p> Typically a moderator will ask a short series of questions, and people in the chat answer them by number. You always have the option to listen and not respond. However, your answer may help someone. I encourage you to  <a href=\"http://janetfouts.com/how-to-participate-in-a-tweet-chat/#axzz3TtB1QECu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  join the party </a> !</p><p> Tip: Use a dashboard like TweetDeck to create a column for the tweet chat and follow in real time. Two of my favorite weekly chats are #SBizHour (Mondays at 2pm MT) and #TChat (Wednesdays at 5pm MT).</p><h3> 5. Lists</h3><p> <br/> As many professional organizers will tell you, everything in your home and office should have a place. Twitter is no different. Organize your digital stream by using lists. A sample of four you may find helpful:</p><li> Influencers</li><li> Competition</li><li> Your Company and Co-Workers</li><li> Customers <br/>  </li><p> You are able to click on that list once created and focus on one subject matter at a time. Your lists can be public or private, so for one like &ldquo;competition&rdquo; I suggest making private.  </p><p> Lists are also a great way to find new people to follow. You can look at an industry expert&rsquo;s lists they&rsquo;ve created or are a part of, and find a helpful trail of similar people to connect with. You can subscribe to the list itself or choose to follow specific members.</p><h3> 6. Growth</h3><p> <br/> You truly are limitless (when in compliance with the  <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/68916-following-rules-and-best-practices\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2000 rule </a> ) with your growth potential. As you are starting out, follow 10 interesting people a day. They don&rsquo;t all have to be in your industry. Follow people or brands related to an interest you have or because they offer great wit.</p><p> Tip: People / brands should be active on Twitter to be considered interesting!</p><p> Add them to a created list. One person not related to my industry, but one I so enjoy following and conversing with is  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meredithheron\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Meredith Heron </a> . She is a designer and active social media user. Not only is her Twitter stream filled with beautiful images of fabric swatches and gorgeous creations, it is also filled with how she incorporates her work into her life.</p><p> Mind you the only sewing machine in my house belongs to my daughter, and I am a smidge color blind, but this woman rocks and is plain fun to follow. I end up learning from her on how a person represents a brand on social and engages with their followers, which I then in turn use with my clients. See, we all can learn from each other!</p><h3> 7. Tagging</h3><p> <br/> An engaging Twitter feature is the ability to mention others both in the post itself and in tagging photos. The beauty of tagging in the photos is that the character count isn&rsquo;t affected.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillMcGowan22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bill McGowan </a>  and I follow each other on Twitter (we met in an industry tweet chat &ndash; he&rsquo;s a brilliant mind to follow). I tagged him in the photo of a tweet where I mention his book Pitch Perfect. He then favorited my tweet.</p><p> Use tagging as a way to engage with others. You&rsquo;ll get so much more out of Twitter by &ldquo;talking&rdquo; with others as opposed to just lurking.</p><p> How are you incorporating Twitter with your brand? Who are the influencers you follow?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-22 14:08:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-22 14:08:57.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_mEp6Z8l.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/seven-reasons-you-should-still-be-talking-about-twitter/\", \"post_id\": \"11239\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-22 14:08:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-22 14:08:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"seven-reasons-you-should-still-be-talking-about-twitter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11237\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5497\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Seven-Reasons-You-Should-Still-Be-Talking-about-Twitter.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"621\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464030000,"author_id":185,"chart_url":""}

The heir's \"basis\" in the property (the amount, equivalent to a purchase price, deemed the heir's initial value for tax purposes) is what the property is worth upon the date of death. Only appreciation from the date of death will be subject to any capital gains tax. Under Obama&rsquo;s proposal, the estate will have to pay tax on any capital gains as of the date of death. As I read the proposal, these taxes are in addition to any estate taxes.</p><p> For example, assume your mother purchased an acreage 20 years ago for $30,000. At the time of her recent death, the property was worth $500,000. Under the current law, you would receive the land with a new \"stepped-up\" basis of $500,000. Neither your mother&rsquo;s estate nor you would pay any taxes on the $470,000 gain.</p><p> Under the president&rsquo;s proposal, your mother&rsquo;s estate would pay up to $88,060 in tax on the gift to you (the first $100,000 of gain would be excluded from taxation), leaving that much less to distribute to you and any other heirs. Even worse, suppose the acreage was the only property of significant value your mother had owned. It&rsquo;s conceivable that the estate would have to sell the property to raise money to pay the tax, then distribute the remainder of the sale proceeds to you. In effect, the new tax law could eliminate your ability to inherit the land and reduce the value of what you receive by $88,060.</p><p> The next proposal in the budget is to cap any 1031 tax-deferred exchanges of investment property. This proposal would also completely end all like-for-like deferred tax exchanges for collectibles and art.</p><p> The 1031 is a popular real estate tax planning provision where an investor can exchange a property for another \"like-kind\" property and defer the capital gains tax until the property is eventually sold for cash.</p><p> The President wants to limit the deferred gain to $1,000,000 in any one year. Any gain above the limit would be taxable at up to 23.8%. Since there is inherently no money changing hands in an exchange, the investor would have to have sufficient additional funds available to write the US Treasury a check. This would effectively end the 1031 exchange as a tax planning tool for all but the smallest of investors.</p><p> Another disturbing proposal is to apply the 3.8% \"Obamacare Tax,\" (a net investment tax for those with adjusted gross income over a certain threshold) to S Corporation dividends. Currently, shareholders don&rsquo;t pay this tax on such dividends. The proposal would now tax all pass-through income as self-employment income, subjecting S Corporation dividends to the tax.</p><p> The chances for any of these proposals to become law in 2016 are remote, given that Congress is currently controlled by Republicans and we are in an election year. Yet the proposals may indicate some of the revenue possibilities lawmakers are looking at. It's a good idea to keep those possibilities in mind in considering your own estate and tax planning.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-22 14:15:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-22 14:15:49.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_iDnZD5q.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/revenue-possibilities-obama-would-like-and-lawmakers-are-looking-at/\", \"post_id\": \"11241\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-22 14:15:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-22 14:15:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"revenue-possibilities-obama-would-like-and-lawmakers-are-looking-at\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11240\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5498\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Revenue-Possibilities-Obama-Would-Like-and-Lawmakers-Are-Looking-At.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"700\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464015600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5278,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Simpler Way to Add the Benefits of Real Asset Investing","link":"a-simpler-way-to-add-the-benefits-of-real-asset-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> WHY REAL ASSETS?</h3><p> <br/> Disappointing global economic growth in the recent past has moved central banks to intervene with aggressive monetary policy, fueling the drive toward riskier asset classes. Inflation has been muted and traditional fixed income assets have not provided the yield necessary to meet short and long-term income needs. In response, an increasing number of investors are looking to other asset classes to serve as sources of income and to maintain purchasing power.</p><p> Institutional investors have long incorporated real asset classes such as commodities, real estate, agricultural land or oil into their portfolios. The potential advantages to these types of exposure are many, and include dampening inflation risk, improving portfolio efficiency, accessing stable bond-like yields and participating in equity-like capital appreciation.</p><p> Financial advisors and individual investors are now following this wisdom and adding real assets to their portfolios, aided by two major factors. First, investment vehicles such as exchange traded funds (ETFs) join a growing menu of mutual funds that can make real assets more readily available. Second, the range of investment strategies is continually expanding, offering asset owners&rsquo; maximum flexibility in addressing all their real asset needs.</p><p> However, the sheer magnitude of available options may be acting as a headwind, hindering investors&rsquo; adoption of real assets. Potential users are often discouraged because they are not sure which real asset strategies are most appropriate to meet their investment objectives. At FlexShares, we believe this conundrum presents an opportunity &ndash; because there is a simpler way to take advantage of the benefits of real assets.</p><h3> THE RISE OF REAL ASSET INVESTING</h3><p> <br/> First, some background on real asset investing. Prior to the late 1980s, many investment professionals believed the best way to mitigate portfolio risk was to diversify holdings among different asset classes, focusing primarily on stocks, bonds and cash. This approach, popularized by institutional money managers, ultimately led to the model 60% equity/ 40% fixed income portfolio. </p><p> This traditional asset allocation continued to evolve as institutions sought investments that better matched their liabilities and also offered higher-growth alternatives. U.S. entities with pensions or other fixed long-term funding obligations started to expand their asset allocation to include hedge funds, private equity, foreign stocks and real assets. This approach was popularized by David Swensen, the chief investment officer of Yale University Endowment. Over time, a wide range of other institutional investors embraced more diverse asset allocations, and began to deploy a greater share of their investment capital toward real assets, as demonstrated in Exhibit 1. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/defined-benefit-plan-flexshares.png\" width=\"553\"/></p><p> In Swenson&rsquo;s endowment approach, real assets account for approximately 30% of the total asset allocation and consist of &ldquo;pure play&rdquo; (or single-focused company) real asset investments and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), which are real-return financial instruments. Swenson&rsquo;s asset mix excluded the commodity markets due to their volatile nature and lack of income opportunity. This allocation approach emphasizes long-term assets, stable inflation-adjusted income and current yield.</p><p> However, it also presents drawbacks for individual investors, who typically lack:</p><li> Expertise to source and measure the relative performance of &ldquo;pure play&rdquo; real asset investments;</li><li> Ability to handle the regulatory and operational hurdles associated with real asset industries;</li><li> Patience to bear the potential illiquidity risk; and</li><li> Knowledge to invest tactically and determine the optimal allocation of underlying real asset categories. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that many potential investors either avoided investing in real asset classes or invested in a sub-optimal, narrow manner.</p><p> One desirable solution may be a turnkey, equity-based real asset allocation product that addresses the identified drawbacks and, ideally, could be applied across the full range of client investment objectives. </p><h3> Real Assets and Income Generation</h3><p> <br/> Historically, the strong dividend payments of real asset securities have presented a good option for income sensitive investors. This is especially important in zero or near zero rate environments where traditional income producing assets such as fixed income, have compressed yields relative to historical norms. The income component is largely driven by the generally steady and predictable cash flows produced by real estate. Due to contractual and regulatory agreements, cash flows generated by real estate and infrastructure asset classes are high-confidence cash flows. As commercial and retail rental rates are re-negotiated periodically, they can better adjust in rising-rate or inflationary environments. Furthermore, because the infrastructure industry tends to be highly regulated, these companies are contractually allowed to make periodic pricing adjustments, typically based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While economic conditions may help or hurt asset-level performance, the contractual nature of infrastructure-related revenue streams tends to make flows more secure. Consequently, infrastructure cash flows persist even when economic growth is subdued. </p><h3> Real Assets and Capital Appreciation</h3><p> <br/> In addition to income, the total return potential of real assets is another attractive feature, as highlighted in Exhibit 2. Due to their sensitivity to macroeconomic trends, real assets offer potential capital appreciation. When economies expand, the global demand for natural resources and commodities such as copper, iron ore, liquefied natural gas and grains all typically increase. This expansion ultimately affects related industries like home builders, infrastructure projects and fuel suppliers. The rapid growth in emerging economies, fueled by urbanization, raises demand for energy, industrial metals, infrastructure and housing. This increase in demand positively affects real asset growth and capital appreciation prospects. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/compund-annualized-returns.png\" width=\"512\"/></p><h3> Real Assets and Long-Term Purchasing Power Protection</h3><p> <br/> The current non-seasonally-adjusted CPI level is historically low. Many investors, however, have liabilities that span multiple inflationary cycles as well as other expenses that march higher than traditional inflation measures (e.g., health insurance premiums), and so require inflationhedging tools to address these situations. Historically, real assets have responded favorably in rising inflationary or expanding economic cycles. As a result, real assets are strongly correlated to inflation, as highlighted in Exhibit 3. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/correlation-of-asset-class-returns.png\" width=\"592\"/></p><p> Consequently, many investors seek real assets to diversify away inflation risk, while also complementing their return objectives. The attractive inflation sensitivity of real assets is a key reason why many institutional and retail investors desire real assets exposure.</p><h3> INVESTORS LOOKING FOR DIVERSIFICATION WILL KEEP LOOKING TOWARD REAL ASSETS</h3><p> <br/> Given rolling environmental, resource scarcity and inflation/disinflation concerns, the need for new sources of portfolio diversification has never been stronger. In the hunt for unique sources of return, we believe now is the time to consider real assets in your portfolio construction. Real assets may play a key role in driving global growth and providing strategic long-term investors with a new way to construct a more efficient and balanced overall portfolio. We believe an allocation to real asset classes in a traditional portfolio is beneficial for investors looking to minimize risk and also address income and capital appreciation objectives. It may provide improved inflation-adjusted annualized returns in periods of rising inflation and downside protection through income, along with equity-like upside. </p><p> For more information contact FlexShares at 1-855-FlexETF or visit us <a href=\"http://flexshares.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> .</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 13:27:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 13:27:18.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_VydTqvJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-simpler-way-to-add-the-benefits-of-real-asset-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"11246\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 13:27:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 13:27:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-simpler-way-to-add-the-benefits-of-real-asset-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11242\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5499\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/A-Simpler-Way-to-Add-the-Benefits-of-Real-Asset-Investing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1622\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464152400,"author_id":323,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5280,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Determining What it Takes to Engage Millennials in Business","link":"determining-what-it-takes-to-engage-millennials-in-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This past week I traveled to and worked with leaders in five cities across the US and Canada (Baltimore, Philadelphia, Knoxville, Houston, and Vancouver, B.C). In addition to three topics I typically talk and consult about (customer experience, leadership, and culture), in every setting one word kept coming up &ndash; Millennials!</p><p> Most leaders and frontline workers are trying to determine what it takes to engage Millennials (the group born somewhere between 1980 and 1996). We are all seemingly looking to connect with and retain millennial employees, co-workers, and customers.</p><p> Recently Gallup conducted an exhaustive study of Millennials &ndash; the results of which can be purchased or you can attend a regional workshop discussing the findings. For the purpose of this article, allow me to give a few highlights (or maybe you will view these as lowlights) from the comprehensive Gallup study:</p><p> When it comes to employment, most Millennials are constantly scanning their environment for opportunities.</p><li> 21% of Millennials say they have changed jobs in the past year.</li><li> The millennial turnover rate was three times that of other generations in the past year.</li><li> The annual cost to the U.S. economy, based on Gallup estimates, for millennial turnover is $30.5 billion.</li><li> Millennials report they are less likely to be with their current employer in a year (50% for Millennials vs 60% for other generations).</li><li> As would be expected from the &ldquo;likely to stay&rdquo; data, 60% of Millennials also report they are open to a new job opportunity (15% higher than non-Millennials).</li><li> Only 3 in 10 Millennials report being behaviorally and emotionally engaged in their job, while 16% are actively disengaged (pulling at cross-purpose with their companies).</li><p> So, what does this mean for your business?</p><p> From my vantage point, there are three important takeaways and action steps for each:</p><li> Traditional efforts which worked to engage many prior generations won&rsquo;t work with Millennials.</li><p> Action Step: Spend more time talking directly to Millennials about what, if anything, you can do to increase the likelihood they will remain in your employment in a year.</p><li> The future workplace will be far more transient.</li><p> Action Step: Become efficient at on-boarding and orienting new hires to be productive quickly given that they will have a limited tenure working on your behalf.</p><li> Employee engagement and loyalty will become an even greater business advantage.</li><p> Action Step: Study trend data to gain a competitive advantage by increasing &ldquo;discretionary effort&rdquo; and &ldquo;length of stay&rdquo; for millennial workers. Brands that keep them longer, and get more out of each hour they are with you, will win in this changing work landscape.</p><p> Finally, the future is not bleak, it is bright!</p><p> Millennials are intelligent, energetic, entrepreneurial, and well-educated. People who treat them as such and build work environments that address their values and lifestyle will thrive in very special ways!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 15:17:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 15:17:46.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Y4kSuyE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/determining-what-it-takes-to-engage-millennials-in-business/\", \"post_id\": \"11250\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 15:17:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 15:17:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"determining-what-it-takes-to-engage-millennials-in-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11249\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5501\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Determining-What-it-Takes-to-Engage-Millennials-in-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"608\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464105600,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5281,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Less Obvious Points to Consider Regarding DOL Fiduciary Standards Ruling","link":"4-less-obvious-points-to-consider-regarding-dol-fiduciary-standards-ruling","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Just before year-end 2015, I wrote a piece entitled  <a href=\"http://www.diamond-consultants.com/awaiting-the-dol-storm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Awaiting the DOL Storm </a> . Its premise was that advisors were awaiting a major shift in the regulatory environment and expecting the worst, but hoping for the best. Certainly, since the beginning of April of this year when the DOL released the rule (which won&rsquo;t take effect until next April), much has been written about the implications for our industry.</p><p> I won&rsquo;t bore you with yet another article on the reported details of the rule; however I will share some of the less obvious points to consider: </p><li> While it appears that advisors dodged a bullet relative to how onerous the DOL ruling is, it is NOT a non-event. Senior leaders at major brokerage firms (wirehouses, regionals and independents) are deep in the labs trying to interpret the 1000+ page rule and come up with new policies and procedures to protect and corral their advisors. The advisors are holding their breaths, waiting to see if &ndash; as a result &ndash; their compensation will be affected, client fees increased, and if commission business and the sale of annuities will still be welcome.</li><li> It may be truer than ever that scale matters. To be sure, smaller broker dealers are struggling to invest appropriately in the technology, infrastructure and platform required as the regulatory environment changes. While advisors that work under these boutique umbrellas value how nimble their broker-dealers can be and the access they have to senior leaders, many tell us that they are worried&mdash;while nimble is nice, protected is better. &ldquo;Is my broker-dealer resourced well enough to build comprehensive compliance programs around the rule&rsquo;s requirements?&rdquo; As a result, we will likely see more transactions being done where large, scaled broker-dealers acquire their smaller counterparts.</li><li> The big open-item is whether the SEC will step up and decide to enact a uniform fiduciary standard. This possibility certainly raises the question for advisors whose businesses are a large percentage commission based. Will these advisors be relegated even more to dinosaur status and will firms be interested in continuing to recruit them? We have seen a spike recently in the number of transaction-based advisors wanting to explore options beyond their current firm &ndash; and, almost without exception, they talk of wanting to make a desired move before it&rsquo;s too late &ndash; before firms close their doors to non-fee based folks.</li><li> There will likely be a greater migration to the fee-only RIA space because RIAs are already held to a fiduciary or &ldquo;best interest&rdquo; standard and there will be many fewer operational changes required of them. This could potentially create some dilution of the marketing message that RIAs use to differentiate themselves: &ldquo;We are fiduciaries and our broker-dealer colleagues are not.&rdquo; Even within the RIA world, we expect to see consolidation, as smaller firms struggle to comply with an ever-changing regulatory mandate.</li><p> While there seems to be no shortage of information on pending regulation, the fact remains that none of us has a crystal ball that will prognosticate the exact events that will unfold. As such, it seems to me that now &ndash; more than ever &ndash; advisors should take this time of relative calm to assess their business models, goals and relationships with their firms in order to decide if they are ready for potential downpours ahead.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 15:27:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 15:27:51.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_uG46feO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-less-obvious-points-to-consider-regarding-dol-fiduciary-standards-ruling/\", \"post_id\": \"11252\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 15:27:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 15:27:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-less-obvious-points-to-consider-regarding-dol-fiduciary-standards-ruling\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11251\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5502\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4-Less-Obvious-Points-to-Consider-Regarding-DOL-Fiduciary-Standards-Ruling.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"540\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464080400,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5284,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ready to Invest in Real Estate: Homework, Homework, Homework!","link":"ready-to-invest-in-real-estate-homework-homework-homework","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> We&rsquo;ve all heard the mantra: &ldquo;Location, location, location!&rdquo; When buying an investment property, a great location is often considered the #1 rule for success. But as we&rsquo;ve all seen in that late night, a drag-out game of Monopoly, location certainly isn&rsquo;t the only factor at play.</h3><p> <br/> A decade ago, we all learned more than we wanted to know about subprime mortgages. People were investing money they didn&rsquo;t have using loans they should never have been given. The stage was set for the perfect storm. Home prices started falling, refinancing became difficult (especially with historically high debt-income ratios), and those previously attractive adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates.</p><p> Monthly payments rose dramatically and mortgage delinquencies soared. It&rsquo;s the scenario that led to a shocking 3 Million foreclosures in 2009 followed by a complete overhaul of mortgage banking regulations. It took years for housing prices to climb back out of a deep, black hole&mdash;and even longer for people to recover financially and psychologically.</p><p> Prior to the housing crash, real estate had almost always been viewed as a solid investment, averaging over 6% for decades. Now that housing prices are on the rise, investors are once again turning their eyes toward rental properties. Many risk-averse investors gravitate to real estate as an attractive proposition. You can feel it. You can see it. You can drive by your property and know your investment is real. But is investing in property the right choice for you? The answer depends on one thing: the margins.</p><p> Many investors look at a basic equation, &ldquo;money in and money out,&rdquo; when calculating returns. It seems so simple. Purchase a $200k property that generates $1,300/month rent and earns $15,600 a year&mdash;it&rsquo;s a risk-free 8% return using borrowed money! But is it? There&rsquo;s much more to the equation, and if you dive in and look at the details that deliver the actual margins and return, you may find your investment isn&rsquo;t what it seems. Be sure you&rsquo;re considering these key factors when calculating your actual profit margin:</p><li> <strong>  Maintenance &amp; turnover costs. </strong>  Of course, installing that new water heater costs more than just your time, and your renters may not be very forgiving of an overgrown lawn. Maintaining any property can be expensive, and costs can escalate even further when you experience turnover. Cleaning, marketing, and preparing your property for a new tenant adds up, and every day your property is vacant becomes another drain on your margin.</li><li> <strong>  Insurance &amp; mortgage expenses.  </strong> Insurance premiums for rental properties can run over 20% more than a typical homeowners policy, and additional liability insurance may be required. Also, consider that mortgage rates are higher for second (and third and fourth) homes, and require a 20%+ down payment. Creative techniques to use personal lines of credit can be used to mortgage the property, but that means tying up your available credit that may be needed as an emergency fund during leaner times.</li><li> <strong>  Liquidity. </strong> Speaking of liquidity, you pay a steep price for being able to &lsquo;touch&rsquo; your property. While it may not be a tangible expense, real estate&rsquo;s lack of liquidity creates costs when you need cash and timing is an issue. In most cases, completing a sale and seeing any cash in your pocket can take several months, which can force you to borrow money to cover expenses. And borrowing may be difficult if you&rsquo;ve tied up your credit line with the property.</li><li> <strong>  Weighting.  </strong> Many clients ask me, &ldquo;How much should I invest in property?&rdquo; Unless you&rsquo;re building a career in real estate, an age-old rule of thumb is that your net worth should be spread evenly across three areas, with 33% of your equity in each: 1) real estate, 2) partnering with the great companies (i.e., owning equity), and 3) lending to great companies (i.e., owning bonds). And yes, your home must be included in this equation!</li><li> <strong>  Estate &amp; legal complexity. </strong>  Have you seen what lawyers charge these days? As a landlord, you&rsquo;ll need legal help to understand your rights, draft rental and operating agreements, choose which type of entity should own your properties, etc. If a tenant needs to be evicted or if you have a dispute, legal fees can skyrocket. Plus, estate planning for real estate can get complicated (and expensive) quickly with an LLC or partnership.</li><li> <strong>  Capital gains &amp; depreciation. </strong>  It&rsquo;s not uncommon for CPAs to recommend investment property to minimize taxes, but in reality, when the time comes to cash in your chips and sells that property for college or that summer home you&rsquo;ve dreamed about for years, all depreciation is essentially recaptured by your diminished basis&mdash;and subtracted from your &ldquo;earnings&rdquo; and any return on investment. Capital gains tax ranges from 15% to 20%, so they&rsquo;re an important part of your real margin. Postponing capital gains is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul&hellip;and it all comes around in the end. (Think you&rsquo;re exempt? If you haven&rsquo;t lived at a property for at least two of the previous five years, you&rsquo;ll lose the  <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/bankrate-s-2010-tax-guide-realty-capital-gains.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  capital </a>   <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/bankrate-s-2010-tax-guide-realty-capital-gains.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  gains </a>   <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/bankrate-s-2010-tax-guide-realty-capital-gains.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  tax </a>   <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/bankrate-s-2010-tax-guide-realty-capital-gains.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  exemption </a> , which allows individual filers to keep $250,000 of profit from the sale tax-free.)</li><li> <strong>  Tax complexity. </strong>  It sounds great: write off expenses through the property to avoid Self Employment tax on your income. If you carry a loss, now you have stepped into  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p527/ch03.html\" target=\"_blank\">  Passive </a>   <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p527/ch03.html\" target=\"_blank\">  Loss </a>   <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p527/ch03.html\" target=\"_blank\">  Land </a> . Income exclusions limits, at-risk rules, passive activity limits, etc. Don&rsquo;t forget property tax! All of this complexity eats up your valuable time, increases your expenses, and reduces your margins.</li><li> <strong>  Compensation for your own hours worked. </strong>  Here is a couple of questions for you: How much do you make an hour? Is your money working for you, or did you &ldquo;buy&rdquo; another job? For example, if you&rsquo;re earning $150K annually working 40 hours a week (with a few weeks vacation thrown in), you&rsquo;re making about $78/hour before benefits. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for property owners to spend several hours a week managing everything from rent collection to fixing water heaters to dealing with vacancies and rental applications. Of course, if you&rsquo;re paying someone else to manage your property, be sure to subtract management fees from your margin, and include your true hours worked in the equation as well. <br/>  </li><h3> So is buying investment property a wise idea? Is it the best way to build wealth? Is rental property really &lsquo;risk averse&rsquo;?</h3><p> <br/> Only if you can be certain that &ldquo;sure bet&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t turn into a financial drain that steals your precious time, overweights your net worth with investments that lack liquidity, and adds too much complexity to your finances. If you&rsquo;re not willing to do your homework and consider these important factors, don&rsquo;t expect the location to save a poorly planned use of your life savings. Even Park Place won&rsquo;t win the game if your margins aren&rsquo;t in line with your costs.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 16:48:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 16:48:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_ucrEfed.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ready-to-invest-in-real-estate-homework-homework-homework/\", \"post_id\": \"11259\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 16:48:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 16:48:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ready-to-invest-in-real-estate-homework-homework-homework\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11258\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5505\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ready-to-Invest-in-Real-Estate-Homework-Homework-Homework.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"993\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464094800,"author_id":341,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5285,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Putting The Fun In Target Date Funds","link":"putting-the-fun-in-target-date-funds","source_link":null,"content":"<p> To the layperson, investors are usually seen as a knowledgeable and busy bunch. They&rsquo;re not wrong. The best investors are active, managing their portfolios regularly and making small improvements as they go along.</p><p> But investing can be for everyone &ndash; not just stock market gurus and Wall Street fanatics. So how can more casual investors put their money towards good use without spending all of their time as well as finances?</p><p> That&rsquo;s where target date funds come in handy. Designed for the hands-off investor, they&rsquo;re a great way to invest your money without investing your time.</p><h3> What are Target Date Funds?</h3><p> Target date funds are a basket of funds designed for investors who want an easy retirement option. Like their name, these funds are organized by date. Investors can choose which fund they want based on the corresponding year in which they hope to retire.</p><p> For example, a 25 year-old may choose a 2055 target-date fund, when they&rsquo;ll be 65 years old.</p><p> So how exactly do the funds change over time? Like with most investment strategies, it&rsquo;s all about intelligently handling market risk.</p><p> As the investor gets older, the fund automatically rebalances to become more conservative over time. The fund that a 25 year-old purchases will be allocated towards safer investments when that consumer is 40, and even safer when they&rsquo;re 60.</p><p> Many investors who want to save for retirement are unable, uninterested or uncertain of their ability to choose their own funds. Creating a solid mix of funds can require hours of research, and staying on top of their allocation can be a chore even for the most seasoned financial professional. That&rsquo;s why target-date funds are so popular; they already have the funds and investment strategy chosen for you.</p><h3> Target Date Fund Fees</h3><p> One of the downsides to a target-date fund is its fees.</p><p> Fees have decreased in recent years, but investors still need to check that their returns are not being overtaken by outrageous charges. Fees are required to be listed so investors can easily compare various funds, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to read the fine print.</p><p> The difference between a fund with fees between 0.49% to 0.76% and one with 0.16% and 0.18% could be $38,000 for someone who invested $5,000 a year for 30 years.</p><h3> How to Manage Your Target-Date Fund</h3><p> Too many people choose a target-date fund based on inappropriate considerations. Instead of choosing it based on the date you hope to retire by, consider your tolerance for risk. Some people may be more tolerant and need to invest more aggressively, while others are more conservative. Don&rsquo;t assume that you have to stick with the date that works for your age.</p><p> Even though the fund rebalances on its own, investors still need to check how it&rsquo;s doing. Not all target-date funds are created equal, and each company&rsquo;s target-date fund is allocated differently and provides different returns.</p><p> Between Fidelity, Vanguard and T.Rowe Price&rsquo;s 2020 target date funds, the returns range from 5.5%, 6.58% and 7.15% respectively.

{"original_id":5286,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Does Your Brand Embrace Customer Interaction with Meaning?","link":"does-your-brand-embrace-customer-interaction-with-meaning","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Do you ever have decision fatigue? Have you ever gone through your day tired of answering pointless questions? And always answering them the same? Room for cream? Paper or plastic? Would you like a receipt? Do you want cash back with that? Yes, Paper, No, No. Yes, Paper, No, No. Yes, Paper, No, No. I&rsquo;ve been to Starbucks thousands of times. Guess what? I always take cream in my coffee. Always. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if every Starbucks counter person knew that about me?</p><p> In fact, you know what would be really great? Customer interaction with meaning. That&rsquo;s right. Think of a bygone era when shopkeepers knew their customers. Now, of course, with thousands of customers going through your doors each day at multiple retail locations, it&rsquo;s simply not practical to think that your customer service people could know each customer. Or is it?</p><p> What if the technology was such that I could choose to let a brand know things about me? What if there were specific details about transactions that I would love to let the retailer know? Instead of repeatedly asking me the same question time after time, day after day, the customer service person could smile at me and engage me about something non-trivial, something meaningful. They could even make a relevant statement that would raise my appreciation for them and for the brand. What if we could bring back an eagerness to really know and develop relationships with our customers?</p><p> Well, I think we can. Here&rsquo;s how it would work. Each customer wanting to take advantage of this new system (let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;Agent&rdquo; [1]) would need some type of identifying technology (let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;ID&rdquo;). For me that would be my Apple Watch because that&rsquo;s always on me. But for others it might be their Fitbit, their Samsung Gear, or their smart phone. There would be a way for me to opt into Agent and a separate path to opt into various brands whether that be Starbucks, Home Depot, Kate Spade or Nordstrom. </p><p> Each brand could present simple choices. For Starbucks they might be:</p><li> <strong>  Regular order: </strong> Tall Drip Pike</li><li> <strong>  Room for cream: </strong> Yes</li><li> <strong>  Wants a receipt: </strong> No</li><p> Other brands could present other choices for users who join Agent.</p><p> Every Starbucks could then have an appropriately placed beacon that senses my presence (actually, the presence of my ID). A heads-up display at the counter would give store personnel the information I&rsquo;ve opted to provide them. Now when I walk into Starbucks, that operational minutia can be dispensed with.</p><p> <strong>  Starbucks Person: </strong> &ldquo;Good Morning Jeff. Tall Drip Pike today?&rdquo; <br/> <strong>  Me: </strong> &ldquo;Yes please.&rdquo;</p><p> And from there the conversation could flow naturally.</p><p> Of course, it&rsquo;s not just Starbucks that could play this game. It&rsquo;s every major brand that has a customer service component. And it&rsquo;s not just about the small things like the operational minutia. It could encompass more impactful data points like Kate Spade knowing that I bought both of my daughters purses there for Christmas or Nordstrom knowing that I like Ted Baker shirts and Hugo Boss jackets and that I always need help on Valentine&rsquo;s day getting the right gift for my wife.</p><p> This really brings into view the essential challenge with customer experience. How can we really demonstrate that we care about our customers? How can we show them that we&rsquo;re not just out for profit but we&rsquo;re there to meet them at their point of need?</p><p> There are four primary areas on which we should focus our gaze if we want an increasing base of customers that are happy, engaged and wanting more.</p><li> Who are they? &lt;identity&gt;</li><li> What do they want? &lt;empathy&gt;</li><li> What will they want? &lt;forecast&gt;</li><li> What should they want? &lt;innovation&gt;</li><p> This is really what a system like Agent could represent to the brand.</p><p> <strong>  Who are they? </strong> Well, they&rsquo;re in the system and they&rsquo;re recognized when they walk in the door so we can address them respectfully by their name and we have access to what they&rsquo;ve shared with us should the need arise. We can also make reasonable (and careful, thoughtful) assumptions based on their identity, their demographic and their past history. This of course is all with their permission and is completely revocable by them.</p><p> <strong>  What do they want? </strong> We also know what they want in the moment (and maybe more importantly, what they don&rsquo;t want). For Starbucks, Jeff usually wants a tall drip Pike with room for cream and doesn&rsquo;t want to be asked if he wants a receipt. We know he doesn&rsquo;t want a receipt. For Nordstrom, he likes to know about new Ted Baker shirt designs when they come in and when Seven jeans go on sale but he doesn&rsquo;t want to be asked to open a Nordstrom account. You get the idea. If we really care about our customer, we&rsquo;ll listen to them and we&rsquo;ll treat them accordingly.</p><p> <strong>  What will they want? </strong> Here&rsquo;s where it starts to get artistic. Here&rsquo;s where our customer service can shine &mdash; or utterly fail if we&rsquo;re not careful. How can we provide our customers with products and services they like and appreciate even if they haven&rsquo;t given us those exact insights? If we do this wrong, we could annoy them and be perceived as pushy and salesy which isn&rsquo;t our intent. But if we do it right we could gain goodwill and brand loyalty. At Starbucks, would Jeff like to know about our new Salted Caramel Mocha since we know he loves Caramel Macchiatos? Yes. But let&rsquo;s make sure not to repeatedly ask him this. At Nordstrom, Jeff doesn&rsquo;t mind being told about new brands that are similar to his past purchases. In fact he appreciates it.</p><p> <strong>  What should they want? </strong> The word &ldquo;should&rdquo; here means, what products or services could we innovate that customers might enjoy? That they might crave or &ldquo;die for&rdquo; that don&rsquo;t yet exist? As Seth Godin would say, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t find customers for your products. You find products for your customers.&rdquo; [2] How can we use the information freely given to us by our customers to discover products and services that would truly benefit them, that would truly excite and delight them, that would positively enrich their lives or give them back some of that most valuable commodity, time? How can we use our newly gathered customer insights to drive innovation in a virtuous product development cycle?</p><p> <strong>  Now that&rsquo;s a really great question isn&rsquo;t it? </strong> We started with the question, how can we empower brands to truly deepen relationships with their customers. Well, let&rsquo;s ask them. What are we doing that annoys them? How are we getting in their way? But also, what could we do better? In fact, what products and services could we bring them that they&rsquo;d love? And if that&rsquo;s discoverable, if we create that level of relationship with our customers, now how can we go further? How can we develop an innovation culture in our company to really discover, develop and deliver new, exciting, delightful and meaningful products and services that position our brand as customer-driven and relationship focused? How indeed.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 17:03:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 17:03:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_LxTZZx7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/does-your-brand-embrace-customer-interaction-with-meaning/\", \"post_id\": \"11262\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 17:03:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 17:03:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"does-your-brand-embrace-customer-interaction-with-meaning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11260\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5507\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Putting-The-Fun-In-Target-Date-Funds.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"794\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464156000,"author_id":225,"chart_url":""}

The true story remains a mystery. A (media) spectacle broke loose and a handful of reputations have been damaged. In pursuit for a topic on this first edition of my series &lsquo;Hot or not&rsquo; I was intrigued by the many articles that arose last week after Craig Wright identified himself  as the creator of bitcoin to the BBC and the Economist. Meanwhile Wright has withdrawn his statement. Is Bitcoin hot enough to survive without us knowing who delivered this baby?</p><p> The inventor of electronic payment system bitcoin has been known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto since 2008. In the past several attempts were made on unmasking the real life identity. Without result. Last week after Wright claimed to be the man behind bitcoin, he was being subjected to the many disbelievers that wanted him to put definite proof on the table. Eventually he either failed or refused to do that. Who knows? But earlier, on May 2, 2016, Wright alleged that he had published proof on his website, a cryptographic signature supposedly linked to Satoshi. A website that has now been fully erased and replaced by a page that says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;.  Gavin Andresen, the man who has publicly backed Wright, has been kicked out of the bitcoin project and is no longer allowed to make changes in the currency&rsquo;s code.</p><p> So, a lot of commotion took place around one of the much-discussed and disruptive financial technology (fintech) of these last few years. Of course we&rsquo;re all curious about the genius. Me too. But shouldn&rsquo;t we better focus on the amazingly disruptive character of this crypto-currency?</p><p> Today bitcoin is probably the fastest growing currency on this planet. It was the fintech that the world was waiting for. It paved a way for alternative payment technologies and it stimulated traditional banks to think about other options. Bitcoin is a great, innovative way of evaluating goods, assets and capital. Who the inventor is, I personally don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m proud of the creator and indifferent on his or her identity. Bitcoin is top notch innovation. It has probably been the preface for the unbundling of banking and the future of alternative payment solutions that can, and eventually will, disrupt traditional money. Yes, it needs work in order to keep up with the increasing adoption.</p><p> Concluding from the delays of payment transactions, the bitcoin community that was designed by Sathoshi is probably not capable to handle the current growth and therefore not fit to elevate the technology to a higher level. But it&rsquo;s about the potential. The bitcoin technology does provoke smart people to think about alternative payment solutions and to come up with better iterations. I must admit, I love bitcoin.</p><p> What do you think? Is tracing the mystery man behind bitcoin hot or not?     </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 17:18:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 17:18:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_MEZR2JU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-bitcoin-hot-enough-to-survive-without-us-knowing-the-founder/\", \"post_id\": \"11264\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 17:18:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 17:18:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-bitcoin-hot-enough-to-survive-without-us-knowing-the-founder\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11263\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5508\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Is-Bitcoin-Hot-Enough-to-Survive-Without-Us-Knowing-the-Founder.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"671\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464102000,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5288,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Simple Ways to Improve the Quality of Your Online Content","link":"simple-ways-to-improve-the-quality-of-your-online-content","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you develop online content with freelance writers or an in-house editorial team, it can be difficult to put together consistently high-quality blog for your company blog.</p><p> As an inbound marketing agency, we manage online content initiatives for several clients at a time, and we often field questions about how to produce quality content on so many different topics. The secret, of course, is a passion to get it &ldquo;right,&rdquo; careful organization, and talent. But there are also practical steps that any company could deploy to increase the quality of their online content output. These hold true if you&rsquo;re doing it in-house or even using freelance writers.</p><p> Here are our best recommendations for working with writers and editors to improve the quality of your online content.</p><h3> Start With a Manifesto</h3><p> When we work with a client, the first thing we do is create a buyer persona and identify the most appropriate voice and messaging for the brand. This profile informs all of the other choices we make about the blog, including the style, voice, and tone of each article.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re getting started with online content, use your buyer personas to map out a clear guide for the style of the posts you plan to write. Dig into the details of what your clients want and outline how your blog will meet those needs. You&rsquo;ll be able to use this manifesto to inform every content project you take on and every writer you work with. You&rsquo;ll write content as if you&rsquo;re talking to that buyer persona.</p><h3> Give Clear Instructions</h3><p> One of the challenges of working with freelance writers is that there are many different approaches to writing. While some brands prefer a more journalistic style with less structure, others prefer more authoritative and educational style that is more factual and to the point. The odds of finding a writer who approaches a project exactly how you&rsquo;d like them to is very low. That&rsquo;s why the second most important thing to do when you develop online content is to carefully outline your expectations for each blog post.</p><p> Clearly define the purpose and vision of every blog article. What should be in each section? How should the writer approach the introduction, the tone, and the audience for the post? With each assignment, outline the key points that must be mentioned in the blog post as well as any style or formatting details you prefer such as the post structure, subheadings, quotes, and lists.</p><h3> Simplify</h3><p> When it comes to the quality of the writing, creating content for the Internet is all about simplicity. When sentences are short and the subheaders and formatting are clear, it&rsquo;s easier for your customer to understand what you are trying to say.</p><p> While writing, make sure that your sentences are concise. Avoid using compound sentences or sentences joined by semicolons. Paragraphs should be no longer than three sentences, and each sentence should have a transitional element so that the piece flows as a whole.</p><p> In fact, the shorter and more concise the sentence, the better. All writing for the Internet should aim for a 7th- or 8th-grade reading level, even for highly specialized niches. You should show authority through the information you present and the words you use, not through the complexity of the writing.</p><h3> Take a Break and Use Tools</h3><p> When you write a post in one sitting, you can accidentally write in an informal stream-of-consciousness style. While this works for some brands, it&rsquo;s not typically a good thing. Instead, write your content and then allow time for it to sit for a day or two before you give it a final edit.</p><p> When you&rsquo;ve edited your blog article, run it through a free online editing tool like  <a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Grammarly </a>  or  <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HemingwayApp </a> . These tools will allow you to catch grammatical and structural errors that applications like Microsoft Word and Google Docs often miss.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re going to create online content for your customers, make it great. Use these tips to improve the quality of your blog posts, white papers, and website content, which will in turn improve the quality of your inbound marketing strategy.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 17:20:19.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 17:20:19.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_w9Eeo5g.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/simple-ways-to-improve-the-quality-of-your-online-content/\", \"post_id\": \"11266\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 17:20:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 17:20:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"simple-ways-to-improve-the-quality-of-your-online-content\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11265\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5509\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Simple-Ways-to-Improve-the-Quality-of-Your-Online-Content.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"631\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464116400,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}

Consumers are the &ldquo;forgotten child&rdquo; expected to respond in the same way as those coming before them. The reality is, even though your message is the same, the way it&rsquo;s presented should be very different. </p><p> Social media accounts for 25-30% of all web traffic, and Facebook delivers more traffic to news sites than Google. If you&rsquo;re not capitalizing on this, you could be overlooking a significant portion of your market.</p><h3> Now make it engaging</h3><p> <br/> Now that you&rsquo;ve identified your audience and the appropriate channels to reach them, it&rsquo;s time to create or repurpose your content.</p><p> According to  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-vs-b2c-content-lessons#sm.00000fyrc8867eec2yxj8gdxqne9d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HubSpot </a> , the most engaging Facebook posts are images and quizzes. Everyone wants to know if they&rsquo;re a Carrie or a Samantha and they want to share the results, creating further engagement amongst their networks.</p><p> Here are some of our top tips for creating engaging content.</p><h3> 1) Show don&rsquo;t tell</h3><p> <br/> Finance can be perceived as boring, but your content doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Many consumers don&rsquo;t trust brands, least of all financial institutions. Great content is content that the audience can relate to: for instance by seeing how people in the real world have benefited from using your product or services.</p><p> <strong>  Example: Bank of America </strong></p><p> In this video series Bank of America has partnered with a selection of influencers from race car drivers to home improvement experts. By showing different ways people could save money, or work within a budget, the bank has been able to engage with an audience who wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily choose to spend their time reading about these topics. It also helps build credibility and receptiveness with these audiences when it does come down to the &ldquo;boring&rdquo; stuff.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jeff-gordan-bofa.png\" width=\"839\"/></p><h3> 2) Don&rsquo;t be afraid to think outside the box</h3><p> <br/> Financial services content has traditionally been straightforward, informative and (let&rsquo;s be honest) pretty dry.</p><p> Many marketers focus their attention on language and messaging that is consistent across channels. This hesitance to speak in the voice of your audience can create weariness amongst your intended market who just see clich&eacute;d sales and marketing speak.</p><p> There&rsquo;s now a golden opportunity for financial services organisations to buck the trend have a bit of fun when repurposing content across channels.</p><p> <strong>  Example: Monument Wealth Management </strong></p><p> Monument does a great job making complex topics / issues fun and easy to understand, with great personality. In this article about China&rsquo;s stock market, the company hasn&rsquo;t been afraid to reference pop culture and jump on the meme bandwagon. This is an effective way to capture the attention of a consumer audience &ndash; especially millennials!</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/monument-wealth-management.png\" width=\"684\"/></p><h3> 3) Your data is a goldmine</h3><p> <br/> Financial services institutions sit on a wealth of statistics and data. This data contains incredible insights into consumer habits: how much they spend and what they buy. The proofpoint or expertise of your organisation can be a great tool for providing consumers with content that&rsquo;s relevant and actionable. Your task is to shape this information into an engaging format.</p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-vs-b2c-content-lessons#sm.00000fyrc8867eec2yxj8gdxqne9d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HubSpot </a>  reports the top performing social channels for B2C content are Facebook and Pinterest (as opposed to LinkedIn and Twitter, which rate more effective for B2B content). While a lengthier opinion piece is great for the professional audience on LinkedIn, people scrolling through their feed on Facebook respond better to infographics, videos or easily digestible &lsquo;listicles&rsquo;. </p><p> <strong>  Example: AmeriFirst Home Mortgage </strong></p><p> In this Pinterest post, AmeriFirst Home Mortgage has adapted their expert knowledge of homeownership into an infographic. The visual schedule of home maintenance tasks received over 41,000 shares on Pinterest.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/America-first.png\" width=\"592\"/></p><p> We hope we've laid the foundation for you to start getting creative with your B2C content distribution.</p><p> To learn more about how to get the most of our your content by atomising and amplifying it through owned, earned and paid channels download our free new playbook, A Complete Guide to Content Distribution for Financial Services.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 17:25:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 17:25:34.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_wdBxBvi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-financial-services-can-do-better-in-b2c-content-distribution/\", \"post_id\": \"11271\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 17:25:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 17:25:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-financial-services-can-do-better-in-b2c-content-distribution\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11267\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5510\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-Financial-Services-Can-Do-Better-in-B2C-Content-Distributon.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1258\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464076800,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5290,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Increase Workplace Innovation Through Risk-Taking and Agility","link":"how-to-increase-workplace-innovation-through-risk-taking-and-agility","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Today one of the key challenges most companies face is being able to scale rapidly while still keeping their innovative startup edge. Startups have fewer decision-makers making it easier to take the risks needed to remain as innovative as possible. As these companies start to grow, they often experience a downturn in innovation as management layers increase. In fact, many larger corporations are now attempting to harvest the success of startups by creating small internal companies. This begs the question do you have to stay small to be innovative?</p><p> According to the Economist&rsquo;s study on organizational agility, the main obstacles to improved business responsiveness are slow decision-making, conflicting departmental goals and priorities, risk-averse cultures and silo-based information. This isn&rsquo;t a problem that faces a select number of companies. A survey by McKinsey&amp;Company found that 94% of managers are unhappy with their company&rsquo;s innovation performance. The good news is that you don&rsquo;t have to stay small to avoid these common growth pitfalls. Instead, follow three performance management must haves:</p><h3> Risk-taking</h3><p> Create a culture in which risk-taking is encouraged. Fear of failure is one of the most common inhibitors of innovation. Someone may have a great idea but concern for their job security may keep them from taking the risk to try something new or challenge traditional strategies. Top companies are now taking the opposite approach.  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25880738\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Google X </a> , the company&rsquo;s secret innovation lab, allows googlers to explore game-changing ideas consequence free. It&rsquo;s here that the fantasy of self-driving cars became a reality and inventions such as hoverboards and smart contact lenses have been tested. The criteria are that these ideas actually have to be radical sci-fi sounding inventions which will help solve a global problem in the next 10 years.</p><p> To encourage employees to take risks, managers must give them more space and autonomy to develop early stage ideas. To make this work, a high degree of accountability is also needed. One of the toughest tasks for managers is learning how to keep up accountability within the team, without micromanaging. Creating a set of goals your employees can work towards on their own will allow you to hand off but still check in from time to time and offer guidance.</p><h3> Increase learning agility</h3><p> Exploring new ideas is not enough. The key to being truly innovative is taking risks and then learning from your experiences. People with a high learning agility are able to take feedback and adjust strategies accordingly, without becoming discouraged. For businesses, having a highly agile workforce means employees can be re-skilled quickly to meet new company goals and strategies based on industry trends. A study on learning agility in the workforce concluded that companies with the highest amount of high-learning agile executives produced 25% higher profit margins than their rivals. A series of studies by BTM Corporation on business agility concluded that companies with highly mature business characteristics demonstrated:</p><li> 13% to 38% performance advantage in capital efficiency and value</li><li> 10% to 15% performance advantage in margins</li><li> Up to 5% performance advantage in revenue and earnings growth</li><p> Supporting continuous and disruptive learning centered on the competencies that characterize the company&rsquo;s competitive nature will help managers ramp up their team&rsquo;s performance. To create this type of work environment, managers must focus on metrics-driven skill development and real-time learning. The more training and practice employees get in giving and receiving feedback effectively, the better they&rsquo;ll become at tracking their own performance and integrating feedback into their development game plan.</p><h3> Creating cross-functional teams</h3><p> Often large companies will find that different departments begin to become silos of information, leading to a duplication of work and inter-departmental conflicts. A lack of communication and knowledge-sharing across the organization leads to a failure to utilize all resources available on a project, thereby significantly lengthening timelines.</p><p> As a result, many companies are now harnessing the benefits of cross-functional teams. These teams consist of members with different skill sets and are grouped together on an ad hoc basis to tackle particular projects. Organizing teams in this way creates a smaller pool of decision-makers and allows the team to benefit from the cross-departmental knowledge. Combining the strengths of each person allows these teams to come up with more insightful and out of the box ideas.</p><p> The ability to quickly form cross-functional teams as needed can greatly increase organizational agility. However, managers need more accurate performance data to quickly identify the employees with the appropriate skills needed to meet the company&rsquo;s shifting goals. At the same time, performance data also gives HR better insights into what&rsquo;s missing so they can address skill gaps with more targeted training efforts. Over time, acquiring a growing library of data enables companies to more effectively deploy fast acting and effective teams.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 17:32:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 17:32:56.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_my6lK3x.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-increase-workplace-innovation-through-risk-taking-and-agility/\", \"post_id\": \"11273\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 17:32:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 17:32:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-increase-workplace-innovation-through-risk-taking-and-agility\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11272\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5511\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-to-Increase-Workplace-Innovation-Through-Risk-Taking-and-Agility.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1193\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464116400,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5291,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Second Best Way to Get Referrals…","link":"the-second-best-way-to-get-referrals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I know what you&rsquo;re thinking&hellip; there&rsquo;s another great way to get referrals?</p><p> When I&rsquo;m on the podium or at the front of the class, or in a conversation with a prospect about referrals, I ask the following two questions: </p><p> &ldquo;What do you think is the best way to get referrals?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What do you think is the 2nd best way to get referrals?&rdquo; </p><p> More often than not, I receive a response from the first question.  More times than not, the answer is exactly what I&rsquo;m looking for, &ldquo;The best way to get referrals is to give them.&rdquo; </p><p> More often than not, the second question is usually answered with a blank stare as if to say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another way to get referrals?&rdquo; </p><p> There certainly is another way to get referrals.  Are you ready for your mind to be blown?  Before I blow your mind, see if you can find the common denominator in the two following stories: </p><h3> Connection 1:  (Names will be changed to protect the innocent) Jane Doe <br/>  </h3><p> Jane Doe:  &ldquo;Bobbie, I am a connector.  I introduce and refer people all of the time.  I don&rsquo;t understand why I don&rsquo;t receive referrals.&rdquo;</p><p> I know a number of professionals in Jane&rsquo;s network and inquired about her activities in connecting the right professionals to the right professionals, and it turns out, she has single-handed built some people&rsquo;s business for them through her referrals.  But I also came to find out that these professionals don&rsquo;t know how to refer her, as her business is a niche business.</p><h3> Connection 2: Mike Smith <br/>  </h3><p> Mike Smith: &ldquo;Bobbie, I have been running my business for 5 years.  I network, I refer business, I go out to coffee meetings, I meet up for scotch tastings, and take COI&rsquo;s golfing.  I just can&rsquo;t understand why I am not receiving referrals on a regular basis.  I think it&rsquo;s because of the area I&rsquo;m in.  I think the market is just too saturated with companies that do what we do.&rdquo;</p><p> Honestly, we are all in the relationship business in the B2B service based industry environment.  You can throw a rock and hit anyone in your specific vertical.  It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re re-inventing the wheel with our businesses.  Communication is key.</p><p> I can give you dozens of more examples but I think this is enough info to make my point. </p><p> Did you notice a common denominator, or lack thereof, in these two examples?</p><p> Now&hellip; are you ready for your mind to be blown?</p><p> In neither instance did either of these two connections actually ask for referrals.  Also, they didn&rsquo;t provide enough information to their COI&rsquo;s to be able to refer them. </p><p> So there it is &ndash; the 2nd best way to get referrals is to ask for them.  How do you feel about that answer?</p><p> I find that most folks are apprehensive about asking.  So let me give you a powerful example of how to ask for a referral, as well as a LinkedIn (of course) process that will help you be more specific when asking.</p><h3> Referral Example: <br/>  </h3><p> Conversation without using LinkedIn for research purposes:</p><p> I want you to know how much we enjoy doing business with your company and look forward to continued success as we continue to develop our professional relationship.  I would very much like the opportunity to do business with people that do business the way you do, that you believe I can impact the same way I have impacted your company.  Who do you know in your network that would make sense for me to meet?  Would you be so kind as to provide an introduction?  </p><p> Conversation using LinkedIn for research purposes:</p><p> I want you to know how much we enjoy doing business with your company and look forward to continued success as we continue to develop our professional relationship.  I would very much like the opportunity to do business with people that do business the way you do, that you believe I can impact the same way I have impacted your company.  I see that you are connected to the following 12-15 people that I would be interested in speaking with.  Would you be so kind as to provide an introduction to the top 3 on the list that you think make sense and with whom you have a good enough relationship to open the door? </p><p> (List the names and LinkedIn links of the professionals you would like to meet)</p><p> 1.</p><p> 2.</p><p> 12.</p><p> I have even included an introduction that you can simply cut and paste into an email or LinkedIn message, edit as you see fit, or completely disregard and compose your own.</p><p> (Provide the brief introduction for your connector to cut and paste) </p><p> These can be verbal conversations or digital conversations &ndash; that is your preference. </p><p> For directions on LinkedIn searches that you can perform on your 1st Degree Connections&rsquo; Connections, check out Kurt&rsquo;s blog, The Effective 1:1 Networking Coffee Meeting.  Use this process to search for a list of professionals that meet your ideal client profile with LinkedIn&rsquo;s filters, such as company size, location, Seniority Level, and much more.</p><p>  Human nature dictates that (for the most part) we want to help each other.  Why not make it easier to be helped?  Look at the situation I outlined.  You have taken all the work of the plate of your connector. </p><p> Your old process looked like this:</p><li> You hoped for referrals</li><p> Your new process now looks like this:</p><li> You let your connector know how they can help you - by providing referrals and introductions</li><li> You told them exactly who they know that you are interested in doing business with</li><li> You provided them with the paragraph introducing you to their network</li><li> You are helping them strengthen their current relationships by connecting you with them </li><p> Average conversion ratios of a prospect to the client through warm lead generation are 60%.  Six. Zero.  So if you meet with a different COI/Referral Partner every week, receive (and give) 5 referrals, and close 3, will you hit your quota? </p><p> Let me know your thoughts.  What are you doing to drive your referral network?  How are you the connector?</p><p> Remember:</p><li> Be the first to give to your new business relationships</li><li> Always pay it forward</li><li> Network with purpose.</li><p> Good luck and good networking! Remember&hellip; It&rsquo;s All About Leverage.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-23 17:37:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-23 17:37:39.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_TuTSuAr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-second-best-way-to-get-referrals/\", \"post_id\": \"11275\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-23 17:37:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-23 17:37:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-second-best-way-to-get-referrals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11274\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5512\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Second-Best-Way-to-Get-Referrals.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"494\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464091200,"author_id":68,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5292,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Painful Reality of Women, Money and Retirement","link":"the-painful-reality-of-women-money-and-retirement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I heard on the news recently that two-thirds of Americans would find it difficult to come up with the money to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense. This truly makes me sad.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve all been there at one point or another. Lack of finances has got to be one of the most stressful challenges to live with. I&rsquo;ve experienced it myself, and I&rsquo;ve sat with clients who have gone through tough times, too. There is simply no peace when you&rsquo;re struggling financially.</p><p> One of the biggest reasons for this problem today is loss of income. We all know someone who has suffered a job loss for one reason or another. In that case, it is understandable why coming up with an extra $1,000 would be a challenge.</p><p> But there&rsquo;s another reason I would like look at, which places the blame on lack of financial literacy.</p><p> What tends to get women in trouble is spending money without any sort of plan for getting ahead financially, which also means not being able to put away anything for retirement.</p><p> The first step to taking control of your finances is tracking your money. How much do you have coming in? How much can you afford to spend? This is basic financial management.</p><p> However, the problem is most of us have never been taught proper financial management. A lot of us have had to learn basic money skills the hard way.</p><h3> Women, Money &amp; Retirement &ndash; The Painful Reality</h3><p> There are many reasons I believe women need to pay attention when it comes to their retirement financial security. For instance, statistically speaking women outlive men, and they retire with smaller accounts and Social Security benefits.</p><p> As a women, we have the power to create financial security for a time when we&rsquo;ll need it most: In retirement. It&rsquo;s a matter of being proactive, choosing to take control of your finances and creating financial goals.</p><p> Have you ever stopped to think about how much money you could save every month if you really buckled down and got serious about your retirement?</p><p> Your response might be &ldquo;But Patti, I can barely cover my monthly expenses, how can I possibly save money for retirement, too?&rdquo;</p><p> What if instead of eating out twice each week, you decided to save that $25 dollars? That would give you $100 to put into savings each month. Now, where you decide to save it has the potential to leverage your money into a guaranteed retirement income stream.</p><p> For example, a tax-deferred annuity with a guaranteed lifetime income rider would enable you receive retirement income for the rest of your life. Even if you lived to be 120 years old, and even after your account balance has gone to zero. As long as you&rsquo;re alive, you get a check from the insurance company (insurance companies that provide annuities). That&rsquo;s the power of lifetime income annuities.</p><p> Now, what if you started several of these annuities over time? And, for the sake of diversification, you started them with different companies?

And there&rsquo;s a lot that goes into being a great employee. Generally, we take it for granted that a good employee is someone who excels in their position. However, sometimes the best performers don&rsquo;t have a great attitude, and other times those with the best attitude aren&rsquo;t all that great at their job.</p><p> To make matters even more complex, sometimes an otherwise awesome worker has a personality quirk that drives the people around them insane. We&rsquo;ve all been around at least one Negative Nancy or Loud-Mouth Larry (and if this isn&rsquo;t a recognized colloquialism, it should be), so it&rsquo;s no surprise that these behaviors can make office life nearly insufferable.</p><p> Demeanor, work ethic, and results are all important aspects when it comes to identifying rock-star employees, and yet many people are missing at least one of these elements in their roles. As managers, helping your employees develop in the areas they&rsquo;re lacking can have a huge impact on the success of your department, as you work to raise morale, foster team unity, and improve efficiency all around.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the most common traits that can turn great workers into walking ulcers, and how best to manage them.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the Problem?</h3><p> <br/> Identifying which behavioral issue your employee demonstrates is the first step in figuring out a solution for them. Are they know-it-alls that undermine leadership? Do they bring others down with their jaded view of the world and workplace? Maybe they just have a penchant for turning things in at the last second and compromise trust among their teammates. Whatever the issue is, the most important thing to do is to approach the situation with the understanding and care that are the hallmarks of a good manager.</p><h3> The Show-Offs</h3><p> <br/> These people are extremely confident in their abilities. They love nothing more than to correct others or give advice, even when it&rsquo;s unsolicited, and in team meetings, they&rsquo;ll often be the first to answer questions or offer up solutions for the group. Unfortunately, despite the enthusiasm, they can cause rifts in the workplace by stepping on others&rsquo; toes or silencing great ideas with their loud personalities.</p><p> In some cases, these employees are truly the best at what they do, and their behavior is a reflection of that. In other instances, they&rsquo;re simply overconfident in their skill set and want to be viewed as experts in their role. Evaluating where they lie on this scale is necessary when it comes to seeking a solution in order to retain the former and train the latter.</p><h3> The Experienced Show-Offs</h3><p> <br/> Highly skilled workers with a proven track record for getting results may very well feel underemployed in their current role and seek fulfillment by passing on their knowledge to others. Check out these findings from the MRI Network and  <a href=\"http://www.edassist.com/resources/news-releases/2015/04/millennials-study-press\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  EdAssist </a> :</p><li> 86% of recruiters interacted with individuals who were underemployed or undercompensated in their current positions</li><li> 53% of employees would consider staying at their job if they felt it provided adequate development opportunities</li><p> These numbers illustrate both the potential problem and solution behind &ldquo;show-off&rdquo; employees.</p><p> If they&rsquo;re having to take their development into their own hands, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that you haven&rsquo;t set them on a path for finding personal success in the workplace. The fact that these are some of your best employees means that it&rsquo;s important for you sit them down and discuss their future if you don&rsquo;t want to lose them to another company.</p><p> While you&rsquo;re at it, go ahead and explain that while you love how engaged they are with their role, there are better ways of showing it than calling out answers in team meetings and acting as the personal tutors of the department. Explain that you recognize their talents in their role but that you&rsquo;d like to see how the rest of the team develops, and focus on the moves you&rsquo;re taking to transition them out of their current position.</p><h3> The Showing-Off-Too-Soons</h3><p> <br/> On the opposite side of the spectrum are the employees who are simply filled with a little too much hubris. Though their hearts may be in the right place, their loud personalities may be grating on their fellow workers, and worst of all, they won&rsquo;t have the required experience to back it up.</p><p> For these individuals, it&rsquo;s important not to shame them for their enthusiasm. After all, the more engaged your employees are, the better. Instead, have a one-on-one with them and let them know that you love where they&rsquo;re coming from, but that it&rsquo;s important for the department to operate as a unit, and that their gregarious personalities may intimidate others who are looking to contribute to team discussions.</p><p> It is also entirely possible that, like their highly skilled counterparts, these individuals are seeking advancement in their roles. While they may not be ready for that step yet, it&rsquo;s a good idea to ask them what they&rsquo;d like to be working towards so that you can give them new areas to focus on &mdash;while shifting them away from their self-appointed role as the team spokesman.</p><h3> The World-Weary Deskmates</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes it&rsquo;s not too much enthusiasm you need to worry about from your employees, but the exact opposite. No matter where you work, you&rsquo;re bound to run into an employee or coworker who&rsquo;s just plain had it.</p><p> These individuals tend to be more experienced, hence their gruff demeanors that reek of years of exasperation. In fact, this study from  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182087/companies-maximizing-workforces.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gallup </a>  shows that 21% of employees who have been with a company for 10 years or more are disengaged &mdash; the highest of any tenured group. However, the study also revealed that employees who have been with the company for 10 years or more andare engaged at work happen to be the best performers in their roles.</p><p> What these numbers suggest is that while many of these Jaded Jacks might be bringing office morale down with their skeptical comments and subpar engagement, they also represent a vast pool of potential when it comes to maximizing performance. Like the show-offs, it&rsquo;s necessary that you take the time to sit down with them and understand their goals. Find out how you can help them reach what they want to work towards, even if their ultimate plans don&rsquo;t involve your company. Making the effort to give them opportunities to explore areas of interest within the workplace is a surefire way to increase engagement among them.</p><p> At the same time, respectfully explain how their behavior is being interpreted by those around them, and let them know it&rsquo;s important that they not let what&rsquo;s upsetting them characterize their involvement in the workplace. Instead, extend an invitation to visit you in your office whenever something&rsquo;s bugging them, with the intention to work it out there. This study by  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182321/employees-lot-managers.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gallup </a>  shows that 53% of employees who feel they can approach their managers are engaged in the workplace. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the most experienced workers who need the most positive affirmation from their managers. Let them know they&rsquo;re appreciated.</p><p> Essentially, when it comes to difficult personalities in the workplace, the name of the game is communication. Take the time to understand where these behaviors are springing from and develop solutions around them. Doing so will not only earn you the respect of your workers, but it will also help you foster a positive work environment where everyone can feel comfortable.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 13:08:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 13:08:27.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_kQ5L2cG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/people-no-longer-quit-their-bosses-they-quit-their-peers/\", \"post_id\": \"11283\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 13:08:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 13:08:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"people-no-longer-quit-their-bosses-they-quit-their-peers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11282\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5516\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/People-No-Longer-Quit-Their-Bosses-They-Quit-Their-Peers.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"672\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464174000,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}

According to many research studies that is how long it takes to form a first impression.</p><h3> This first impression is based 55 percent on appearance, 7 percent on the words we use during course of our conversation and 38 percent on the tone of the voice.</h3><p> <br/> So even before you get sufficient time to demonstrate your abilities, prospects and clients have formed their first impression and created &ldquo;labels&rdquo; (serious, fun, blunt, friendly, etc.) about your personality.</p><p> The same is true for you as you meet prospects and clients.</p><p> Why is it so important for you to prove (or disprove) these first impressions to understand who your customer really is deep beneath the surface?</p><p> Because it has major implications for three areas of your business:</p><li> Attracting new clients</li><li> Designing portfolios</li><li> Ongoing service <br/>  </li><p> Attracting new clients is all about the ability for you to quickly build trust. This involves understanding not only your client&rsquo;s personality, but your own personality strengths and struggles.  Are you a natural listener?  Are you empathetic or more focused on outcomes?  If your style is matched with the prospects, you will build trust with less effort.</p><p> When designing a portfolio, many advisors neglect to plan for the financial personality risks. Some clients will envision themselves as bigger risk takers than what they project themselves to be with you.  Or, they may say they are a saver when their expense account proves the contrary.  Discussions on these subjects are very delicate because many clients do not want to admit (or even know) who they really are a deeper level.</p><p> Finally, how can you customize your client experience when you may not even know who your customer really is beneath the surface?  You have a lot of different personalities working with you in your office and each one may have to adjust their style to make the client feel truly cared for and understood.  Every marketing action should be tailored to the personality of your clients.  No need to send a long newsletter filled with market data and facts to your &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; clients.  Are you looking for more referrals?

{"original_id":5297,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Fantasy and Reality of an Affair","link":"the-fantasy-and-reality-of-an-affair","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There is something seductive and addictive about affairs and are both magnified by the element of fantasyland.</h3><p> <br/> And those highs, right? The excitement. The adrenaline. The &lsquo;not knowing&rsquo;. Its thrilling. Those feelings know no boundaries. They suck you in. But with those highs comes the lows, too. And those lows are so much lower than anything else you might have experienced. You know you should step away, you should stop, but you don&rsquo;t. You keep it going despite what you believe you should be doing. Because that part of your brain - your limbic system - hijacks any sensibility and rational thought when you are knee deep in the throws of an affair.</p><p> Let me explain. Two primary parts of the brain are at work during an affair that extend to opposite ends of the spectrum and, unfortunately, don't work in unison. The limbic part of our brain holds all the emotions and functions outside of morality and good decision making that the neocortex - or the most developed part of our brain for working memory, impulsivity, executive functioning - handles. In her book, Exaholics, Dr. Bobby describes it as this: 'The limbic brain notices sexy people and becomes romantically infatuated with them  - whether the neocortex has decided to be married.&rsquo;</p><p> This process often occurs without our consent or intention. Working close to others sends sizzles through your limbic system. This is not good. Nearly all affairs begin with coworkers or friends; they begin gradually, before people have realized what is going on! Infatuation sets in and your ability to stay rational and do the 'right thing' is left behind. By the time the pleasure and excitement of this potentially unattainable person's presence grows too strong to fight, it&rsquo;s too late - you are hooked! An affair charges up your dopamine (neurotransmitter) to your reward system. It makes you feel alive and charged up! All you can see is this person.  But affairs are not based in reality - they are often in fantasyland, where any other relationship (or marriage) looks dull in comparison.</p><p> Soon you will find yourself breaking all of your rules and devaluing your 'values' that, at one time, felt so strong. You will align your days and nights to fit the others. Your life will take on a whole new meaning, meaning it won't really be about your life - but theirs. You will justify spending holidays alone. You will justify why they aren't available at this moment and make excuses for them. But the truth is this: you are really just making excuses for yourself, because not doing that will create a reality for yourself that, at this time, cannot be acknowledged. So you continue to move on, forsaking self, work, and other important people in your life as you wait for the next available moment in time that will quickly - and unfortunately - erase the sadness and madness of your situation and, once again, put you on an emotional roller coaster of extreme highs and lows, frustration, fear, anxiety, excitement. You will find yourself accepting the crumbs of the relationship, debasing yourself to justify your actions, relinquish your power, and continue to tolerate negative behaviors and mistreatment that you previously never believed you would. But it is here that you find yourself.</p><p> During an affair, it&rsquo;s difficult to stay rational and hope that the part of your brain - the neocortex - steps in and takes over the limbic system that sends you on a constant roller coaster, leaves you emotionally and mentally exhausted, and feeling like there is no end in sight - the end that you want. For he/she who wants (whatever) the most, has the least control over it. As guilt and shame take over when it ends, it leaves a person feeling more destroyed, as they often suffer in silence and do not get the support they need from friends. Its during these times that you need your friends the most, but many become judgmental and find it difficult to support you through this loss. </p><p> But they have not only lost so many things along the way - family, friends, support, and so on - they lost the most important thing one can lose: themselves.</p><p> Before you embark on affair, ask yourself, is he/she really worth it?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 13:28:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 13:28:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_L5GzcwW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-fantasy-and-reality-of-an-affair/\", \"post_id\": \"11287\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 13:28:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 13:28:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-fantasy-and-reality-of-an-affair\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11286\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5518\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Fantasy-and-Reality-of-an-Affair.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1932\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464177600,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}

As a jail chaplain, I heard how the abuse began when Jacob was four years old and lasted until he ran away from home three years later. What happened to him was cruel, tragic, and evil. Yet, amazingly, Jacob did not feel one trace of anger toward his parents. On the contrary &mdash; Jacob actually felt sorry for them. Although he was forced to live on the streets and fend for himself by the age of seven, he felt only sadness for his parents&rsquo; state of mind. Otherwise, he was looking forward to life.</p><p> In fact, he told me the biggest challenges since he had been in jail were from doctors and psychologists who kept telling him that he should be bitter, angry, and vengeful. Jacob responded saying that he couldn&rsquo;t change the past and was more interested in moving forward and getting on with life.</p><p> * Jacob&rsquo;s name has been changed.</p><p> ***</p><p> Last week I attended the memorial service of a good friend. Richard was an Englishman, a year younger than me. With our shared Commonwealth background, faith, and immigrant status, we connected at many levels, and I always enjoyed our time together. His death was unexpected, and his memorial served as a wake-up call to many. Richard lived life to the fullest, impacting all around him to pursue excellence and inspiring them to keep persevering, regardless of life&rsquo;s challenges and even if plans didn&rsquo;t work out as expected.</p><p> ***</p><p> Certainly there are times when we need to evaluate and process past experiences both for what we can learn and for our mental and emotional well-being. However, too often people dwell on memories of the past, letting what did happen to shape their expectations of what can happen.</p><p> Jacob and Richard shared very different backgrounds, yet neither of them let regrets or setbacks define them. They both were focused on moving forward in life, one step at a time. </p><p> Our industry&rsquo;s ubiquitous warning phrase, &ldquo;Past performance is not indicative of future results,&rdquo; applies to more than just investment-return discussions; it&rsquo;s relevant to live. Just because something unplanned and negative happens to us, that does not mean we have to permit it to frame our thinking and emotions going forward.</p><p> Many people today obsess about things over which they have no control. At least $42 billion is spent annually in the U.S. treating anxiety disorders, with $22.8 billion of that going to addressing physical illness caused by mental stresses and worries.</p><p> As financial counselors, we often hear about regrets, remorse, and reasons why things didn&rsquo;t go as planned and see the fear and even paralysis that can bring. You can help your clients learn from their bad experiences, but not let those events define them and their appetite and enthusiasm for life.</p><p> When clients share their regrets and fears:</p><li> Hear what they&rsquo;re really saying. Picture their situation. Imagine what they may have felt like during that experience. Listen for words that hint that the real issue may be something deeper you want to ask questions to uncover.</li><li> Isolate the issue. Ask questions to guide your client to realistically assess what happened, consider the reasons why, and decide what they can learn from this to better proceed forward.</li><li> Move instead of mope. Wallowing in what happened and pining for what might have been a waste of time because it is fruitless. Instead, help clients refocus on the next step they can take to realize their dream, and then encourage them to take it.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 15:18:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 15:18:58.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_2zvsSlc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-should-never-let-regrets-or-setbacks-define-you/\", \"post_id\": \"11289\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 15:18:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 15:18:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-should-never-let-regrets-or-setbacks-define-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11288\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5519\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-You-Should-Never-Let-Regrets-or-Setbacks-Define-You.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1212\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464166800,"author_id":378,"chart_url":""}

Preparation should be both tactical and strategic.</p><p> Let me invite you on a preparation journey from the parking lot to the boardroom: </p><h3> Before the Meeting <br/>  </h3><li> Reconfirm meeting the previous day and prepare an agenda to include them!</li><li> Learn their company&rsquo;s dress culture and dress a notch above. You want to &ldquo;fit in&rdquo; yet present yourself so others look up to you as the consummate professional in your field. Remember, Professional Attire is &ldquo;never wrong.&rdquo;</li><li> Think quality &hellip; from attire, business cards and hand-outs to briefcases and yes, even pens.</li><li> Select briefcase size to match your mission. Carrying a large, full briefcase to a 20-minute meeting suggests they are one of many. Your goal is to make them feel like your &ldquo;one and only.&rdquo;</li><h3> Arrivals &amp; Introductions <br/>  </h3><li> Arrive 15 minutes early, but no more than 15-minutes &hellip; they are not literally your only client!</li><li> Upon arrival, cell phones, pagers: Off! NO one else is more important.</li><li> Introduce yourself to the receptionist and offer your card. Visit restroom for a final visual and wash and dry hands thoroughly to help eliminate clammy hands &ndash; the &ldquo;kiss of death!&rdquo; Pop a breath mint.</li><li> STAND in the reception, briefcase in your left hand, leaving your right hand free to shake hands.</li><li> In The Meeting Room, exchange business cards before the meeting and strategically align them around your portfolio to use (perfectly pronounced) names when speaking. Your attention detail is noticed.</li><li> Engage in small talk placing others at ease and make personal client notes. This information can be used in subsequent communication to further relationships.</li><h3> Sitting/Seating: <br/>  </h3><li> Remember, the host, always seated first, sits at the &lsquo;head of the table&rsquo; &ndash; facing the doors. The most important person is seated to host&rsquo;s right. The second most important person: host&rsquo;s left.  Co-presenters sit opposite the host to gesture/exchange silent signals and together, control the meeting.</li><li> Sit (focused) forward and consume much &ldquo;space.&rdquo; The perception is powerful. Good posture and eye contact are imperative.</li><li> Remember, hands belong on the table; you are not &ldquo;underhanded&rdquo; or going to draw a sword/weapon! (origin.)</li><li> Refrain from fidgeting, inattentiveness and touching face/hair. Hosts should stand to introduce versus announce, those present.</li><li> Guests should stand for self-introductions.</li><h3> After the Meeting <br/>  </h3><li> Hosts walk guests to door/elevator/car, referring to the &ldquo;meeting after the meeting&rdquo; when it all comes together.</li><li> Remember to send an email and hand-written &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; notes within 24-48 hours.</li><p> You are now prepped, and properly positioned to personally connect, counter and close at the table!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 15:26:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 15:26:34.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_r6wg0TL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/17-rules-you-should-always-follow-during-business-meetings/\", \"post_id\": \"11291\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 15:26:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 15:26:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"17-rules-you-should-always-follow-during-business-meetings\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11290\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5520\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17-Rules-You-Should-Always-Follow-During-Business-Meetings.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"758\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464192000,"author_id":254,"chart_url":""}

This is easier said than done. What would people in your target market actually want to learn or find out about you? Ask clients and centers of influence for their feedback on what content would be valuable.</li><li> Begin by recording your video in a professional studio with a green screen, proper lighting and a teleprompter. Make sure you give yourself the best chance to look great. And PRACTICE!</li><li> Get your script properly edited and approved by compliance &ndash; BEFORE recording in studio.</li><li> Title the video so people know what content they will be watching. Give them a good reason for viewing. Also give your video a full description that answers clearly why someone would want to watch.</li><li> Make sure the thumbnail picture associated with your video looks like you are someone they&rsquo;d want to watch. The thumbnail can sometimes be a not-so-attractive, in motion, eyes closed type of screen grab of your video. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to choose different thumbnails.</li><li> List the running time of the video when possible. YouTube will automatically do this for you. Under 3 minutes is a palatable amount for a prospect trying to find out about you or learn something. It seems awfully short, but more than 2-3 minutes and the potential viewer has to REALLY want the information you are sharing to sit through the whole thing.</li><li> Tag your video with as many keywords in YouTube as possible. People will find your videos with these helpful tags.</li><li> After uploading your video to Vimeo, YouTube or your website, share a link on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. Let people you are connected with know it is there!</li><li> Send out an email newsletter with a link to your video. Sharing your new videos with your connections is a great way to directly give people the valuable content you have created for them.</li><li> Use your video as a referral tool by telling advocates and referral sources that they can direct people to a new video you&rsquo;ve posted or share a link. Give them a reason to introduce you to someone else!</li><p> The key with video ultimately is to have valuable content, share the content with potentially interested people and engage them to view and share. Video is definitely a great way to get &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; with clients and prospects and share just how great you really are!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 16:19:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 16:19:43.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_uiL8uNQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/creating-video-for-your-website-social-media-10-tips-to-engage-people/\", \"post_id\": \"11295\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 16:19:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 16:19:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"creating-video-for-your-website-social-media-10-tips-to-engage-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11294\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5522\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Creating-Video-for-Your-Website-Social-Media-10-Tips-to-Engage-People.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"374\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464199200,"author_id":322,"chart_url":""}

Define your niche </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> No one is an expert in all things. A true thought leader carefully builds the boundaries of his or her kingdom&mdash;and makes sure it&rsquo;s the land of their dreams. You want your niche to be the intersection of your expertise, your passions and a revenue-generating marketplace for your output. One of my former Andersen colleagues was the national thought leader for executive compensation in accounting and consulting partnerships. Arcane? Yes. Profitable? Wildly.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Blend in your &ldquo;special sauce&rdquo; and go all in </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> This means you must not only be clear on your specialty area, but how you best deliver the goods. Are you a researcher of data and trends or more of a translator? Are you a feisty iconoclast or more of a builder/connector of ideas? What&rsquo;s your voice? Being consistently clear and true on who you are/what you deliver will draw your ideal tribe and build your thought leadership creds.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Zag while everyone else is busy zigging </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Thought leaders are thinking and working 5-10 steps ahead of everyone else. What do you see in the future for your niche? What do you&mdash;and your audience&mdash;need to be doing right now to prepare? This is where personal courage pops up&mdash;you just might need to be the clarion call for change in your tribe.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Build your community </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Not every thought leader is cut out to build a continually engaged community, like a Seth Godin for example. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t start right now to attract and build your own real and digital tribe in your own style.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Publish, publish, publish </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> You don&rsquo;t have a prayer of being viewed as a thought leader without publishing regularly. Books, white papers, articles, blog posts&mdash;choose your best media (yes, it&rsquo;s plural) and get your content out there. Thought leadership doesn&rsquo;t thrive in isolation. Even better? Make media your friend&mdash;social, digital and traditional. The wider the distribution your ideas receive over time, the bigger your influence with your ideal audience.</p><p> Becoming a thought leader is rarely a straight line, but rather the ultimate outcome of doing deep work in a niche you love.</p><p> What makes you curious and passionate enough to invest your time and reputation in?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 16:33:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 16:33:47.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_NTbyEGc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-follow-these-5-strategies-to-be-a-better-thought-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"11296\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 16:33:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 16:33:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-follow-these-5-strategies-to-be-a-better-thought-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11294\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5523\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Creating-Video-for-Your-Website-Social-Media-10-Tips-to-Engage-People.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"554\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464166800,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5303,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Here's How Influencer Marketing Is Going to Progress and Change in the Very Near Future","link":"heres-how-influencer-marketing-is-going-to-progress-and-change-in-the-very-near-future","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Over the past several years, influencer marketing has been building momentum and has transformed into an epic advertising force, thanks to out-of-touch marketing messages and social superstars who have built enormous followings.</p><p> Since 2014, the term &ldquo;influencer marketing&rdquo; has doubled in the number search queries year over year. The modality has officially become mainstream and everyone wants in. This year, nearly 60% of marketers will be increasing ad budgets for influencer marketing. Brands from every niche are tripping over themselves to get into the game and put forth an influencer campaign that resonates with audiences and generates massive ROI. This is understandable considering that if the right influencers are incorporated in a campaign, the results can be unparalleled; influencers generate figures that more traditional modalities can&rsquo;t touch in today&rsquo;s marketing landscape.</p><p> As influencer marketing has matured over the past five or six years, marketers have learned how to discover those who hold authority in the digital realm.  Then, they broke through into listening to the conversations sparked by these social chieftains. Yet even at this current stage where influencer marketing is catching fire as a standard practice, it is still very much in its infancy. This snazzy new marketing tactic, however, is about to leave its more primitive incarnation behind and evolve into a more sophisticated and refined version of itself.</p><p> The revolution is currently underway; learn to understand and accept these changes or get snuffed out by the competition.</p><p> Here are 4 ways influencer marketing is going to progress and change in the very near future.</p><h3> #1: Influencer Marketing Leads the Pack</h3><p> This shift is already occurring and is evident by the number of advertisers bolstering their budgets. Additionally, in a recent study conducted by Augure, 84% of the brands surveyed planned to leverage influencer marketing techniques in 2015. That number is likely to be matched, if not increased, in 2016 as more and more companies bear witness to the unmatched power of social word-of-mouth advertising.</p><p> With influencers at the helm of a marketing message, audiences take notice of the product or service discussed and treat this as a trusted recommendation from a friend. When this type of social credence is paired with a solid content strategy, no Facebook or television ad can compare to the impact.</p><p> By the end of the decade, influencer marketing will have become the most widely accepted and broadly used form of marketing.</p><h3> #2: Imposters Will Be Exposed</h3><p> In the age of technology, advancements in digital tech grow in leaps and bounds virtually overnight. These advancements will allow for influencer identification to grow increasingly easier while separating the imposters from the real deal will become an issue of the past.</p><p> Ted Coin&eacute;, CEO of The Extraordinary Influencer Network, may have articulated this sentiment best when he said,&ldquo;Analytics tools keep improving, which means that measuring influencer performance, rather than just their activity, will become ever easier. This is great for the professionals among us who have built a loyal following. It&rsquo;s really bad news for those who buy fake followers and merely appear influential.&rdquo;</p><h3> #3: You&rsquo;ve got to Pay to Play</h3><p> As many influencers are now considered to be bona-fide celebrities, despite their massive followings, many brands feel that it is unnecessary to actually pay these individuals for their services. In the aforementioned Augure research, nearly 70% of the 600 respondents felt that influencers shouldn&rsquo;t be paid. One third of those surveyed claim to having never paid an influencer for their work. This could be part of the reason Mynewsdesk reported that 56% of marketers complain that they fail to achieve positive results from their influencer campaigns.</p><p> As influencer marketing continues to develop over these next several years, pay rates for influencer will become standardized. This is the natural order of industry maturation. Businesses must understand that these individuals provide a much needed service in an age where more traditional forms of advertising are dying. In order to get these folks to join your cause, they need to be provided with what they desire; a way to pay their own bills.</p><h3> #4: The Boom of Employee Influencers</h3><p> Recently, many companies have been taking notice that everyday individuals can have great social impact with the products and brands that they advocate; this has led to the birth of advocacy marketing. These internal programs help to transform consumers and company employees into brand advocates who help elevate a company&rsquo;s message and credibility through word-of-mouth social advertising. These types of &ldquo;mini-influencers&rdquo; can have massive impact when in numbers as they help to break through the algorithms that surpass brand messages in social feeds. Combined with the fact that a recommendation from a friend is more powerful than any marketing ploy available, this modality has massive potential for growth. In fact, company advocacy programs have skyrocketed 191% in use since 2013. As this trend progresses, it will ultimately alter the face of influencer marketing forever.</p><p> One of the secrets to success is to understand that everything is constantly changing; nothing stays the same forever. Right now, it is influencer marketing&rsquo;s time to evolve into something new, with increased emphasis on effectiveness and ease of execution. The only way for marketers and brands to achieve success is to accept the transformations as they happen. As with any online marketing trend, if you&rsquo;re not on the cusp of the wave, you aren&rsquo;t going to see the results you desire and deserve.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 16:37:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 16:37:43.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_kLN9jtz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/heres-how-influencer-marketing-is-going-to-progress-and-change-in-the-very-near-future/\", \"post_id\": \"11298\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 16:37:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 16:37:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"heres-how-influencer-marketing-is-going-to-progress-and-change-in-the-very-near-future\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11297\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5524\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Heres-How-Influencer-Marketing-Is-Going-to-Progress-and-Change-in-the-Very-Near-Future.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2185\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464184800,"author_id":484,"chart_url":""}

It was an old school way of leading and mobilizing the troops. Finally, I had a leader who showed me another way (thank goodness!) and the power of leading through questions.</p><p> When Laura set a meeting for the two of us to scope out the next phase of work, I was ready. Notebook in hand, we headed up to a conference room with a big whiteboard. The two of us sat at the table; I looked at her, she looked at me and asked: &ldquo;Okay, what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p><p> I waited for her to start telling me her answer to her question. It had to be rhetorical; a kind way to open the conversation and a signal for me to be sure my pen was ready to start scribbling furiously, but she didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p><p> &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she queried again.</p><p> Um&hellip;</p><p> I had a bunch of ideas but knew that she had far more experience in the area than I did so I thought out a weak response like, &ldquo;We have a lot of choices. What do you think?&rdquo;</p><p> She wasn&rsquo;t taking my cue. She pushed further: &ldquo;Let me hear some of your ideas.&rdquo;</p><p> Over the course of the next two hours, we played ping pong. We bounced ideas off of each other not as leader and subordinate but as colleagues focused on a shared goal. (Isn&rsquo;t that how it should be?)</p><p> She didn&rsquo;t let me off the hook either.

{"original_id":5305,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Road to Business Success: A Simple Concept","link":"the-road-to-business-success-a-simple-concept","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I want to share a simple concept with you that can help you grow your business, close more sales, make more money and be more successful in just about everything you do. The good news with what I&rsquo;m about to share is that it isn&rsquo;t complicated or hard, in fact, it&rsquo;s just the opposite &ndash; it&rsquo;s simplicity itself.</p><p> The following excerpt comes from an article in &ldquo;The Economist&rdquo; by the author Schumpeter. I think it speaks for itself:</p><h3> The Economist</h3><p> &ldquo;Keep things simple,\" said Schumpeter. That is the key to a successful business, according to Bain &amp; Co. consultants Chris Zook and James Allen. In their new book, Repeatability, they lay out how the world&rsquo;s most successful companies &ldquo;make a cult of simplicity&rdquo; and relentlessly apply stripped-down business models to new opportunities. You can see this winning formula of &ldquo;simplify and repeat&rdquo; in Ikea&rsquo;s flat-packed furniture, McDonald&rsquo;s hamburgers, and Berkshire Hathaway&rsquo;s buy, improve, and hold approach to investing.</p><p> &ldquo;Lego learned the lesson the hard way. In the mid-1990s, the Danish toy company expanded feverishly into theme parks, television, and clothing lines; that led to years of dismal results. Only when it went back &ldquo;to its roots&rdquo;&mdash;those little plastic bricks&mdash;did big profits return. Businesses have a natural tendency &ldquo;to grow more complex as they mature,&rdquo; and that complexity can be a &ldquo;silent killer.&rdquo; For all the worries companies have about being &ldquo;crushed by the next big thing,&rdquo; the best way to survive dramatic change is to &ldquo;keep hammering away at the simplicity mantra.&rdquo;</p><p> The great thing about this article is that it reminds us all to focus on the fundamentals of what makes us successful, and I can tell you from my own experience that is right on the money.</p><h3> Here are a couple of examples: <br/>  </h3><p> 1) When I was a struggling sales rep prospecting and closing business, I was always on the look-out for the latest technique (you know, the one that happened to work on the last close) or the best leads (there had to be a better lead source than the one that I was calling), or I was looking for some other easier way of finding deals.</p><p> I spent a lot of time changing my approach, searching leads, etc, but in the end what I learned was that I was the most successful when I just called a lot of leads and used the proven scripts I had developed months before. In fact, I closed a lot more deals when I concentrated on following the proven scripts and techniques that always worked. When I concentrated on the simple fundamentals of properly qualifying leads and following up with proven buyers, my business took off.</p><p> What I ultimately learned was that there was no easier, softer way to write business &ndash; I simply had to do the things that were proven to work. And once I accepted and concentrated on being the best qualifier and closer in the office, and once I combined that with making more calls than anyone else in office, that&rsquo;s when I became the top closer out of five branch offices.</p><p> It was as simple as that.</p><p> 2) Fast forward to my current business as a sales consultant. I have spent a lot of time and money chasing the next (complicated) best thing. In my line of work there is a new distraction (supposed to be an easier way of getting clients) being promoted seemingly every day. There are new leads generation programs, new social media groups to join, new ways of delivering my content &ndash; heck, the list really is endless!</p><p> Now I&rsquo;ve chased a lot of these new (complicated) programs and without fail, they all cost me a lot of time, energy and money. Did they bring me a lot of new business? No. What I learned is that when I just focus on my core competency of teaching business owners how to grow highly successful inside sales teams, my business took off. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p><p> Could I improve my CRM system? Sure. Could I start yet another group on LinkedIn? Sure. Could I start a membership site for residual income? Sure. Would all those complicated and expensive measures earn me more money than simply concentrating on what I do best? No.</p><p> My simple business truth &ndash; just like the little Lego&rsquo;s &ndash; is that I make the most amount of money and help the most amount of people when I focus on my fundamental core skills &ndash; helping business owners grow their inside sales teams. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve focused on over the past two years. And, coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve had the best two years of my business!</p><p> Now it&rsquo;s time for you to think about your core competencies. What do you and your company do best? If you&rsquo;re a sales rep, when was the last time you concentrated on the fundamentals of selling? If you&rsquo;re a business owner, when was the last time you focused on how you help people the most? By going back to basics and perfecting those fundamentals, you will likely grow market share and be more successful.</p><p> It really is as simple as that.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 16:42:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 16:42:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_RukHX8c.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-road-to-business-success-a-simple-concept/\", \"post_id\": \"11302\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 16:42:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 16:42:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-road-to-business-success-a-simple-concept\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11301\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5526\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Road-to-Business-Success-A-Simple-Concept.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"613\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464202800,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

He was married with two young children.  His company&rsquo;s success was driven, in large part, by two key employees who managed all of the company&rsquo;s projects. During our estate planning discussion, I suggested to Ralph that he consider doing something (from a lifetime planning standpoint) to ensure that these two key people would stay with the company for the long haul. Hank, with a wave of his hand, dismissed my concern. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t worry about them leaving. I pay them plenty.&rdquo;</p><p> Two months after signing his will Hank died. &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;at least his estate is in good shape.&rdquo; The estate plan worked perfectly, but I was wrong. Three months after his death, the business and Hank&rsquo;s estate were bankrupt.</p><p> Shortly after his death, Hank&rsquo;s two key employees realized that the business was not going to survive without him. While they felt badly for Hank&rsquo;s family, they decided that their first responsibility was to support their own families. They accepted jobs with new employers who had contacted them shortly after Hank&rsquo;s death. Without their supervision, the projects Hank&rsquo;s company had underway came to an abrupt halt. Lack of progress put the construction contracts into default, and the bond company eventually foreclosed on the company&rsquo;s assets. The bond company then threatened to file suit against Ralph&rsquo;s estate for the bond default.</p><p> In only 90 days the business and the value of Hank&rsquo;s estate had evaporated. The one saving grace was the irrevocable trust we had created for the benefit of Hank&rsquo;s family. It was funded with a significant amount of life insurance, but not nearly enough to replace the income stream Hank and Hank&rsquo;s business produced every year.</p><p> The disaster that befell Hank&rsquo;s family (and perhaps threatens yours) was entirely avoidable. You can avoid this estate planning disaster by asking three Exit Planning questions: </p><li> If I walk away from my business today, never to return, will it continue with minimal disruption to its cash flow?</li><li> Can I successfully transfer my business today to the successor of my choice?</li><li> If I sold my business today for fair market value, would my family and I be able to maintain our lifestyle?</li><p> Had Hank and his advisors discussed what would happen to both his family and the business if Hank immediately left his business forever, they would have realized that the business could not continue without the key employees.</p><p> Exit Planners know that when a business depends on the owner&rsquo;s active involvement, it has little or no transferable value. Estate planners see the same situation and know that the income that the ship (business) provided to the captain&rsquo;s family (and all employees) disappears. That&rsquo;s the best-case scenario. In Hank&rsquo;s case, the entire estate, which Hank had used as collateral for bonding purposes, was also lost.</p><p> What could have been done? First, owners must ask and answer an estate planning question. Second, owners must construct an Exit Plan founded on a basic fact.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-24 16:46:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-24 16:46:55.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_qQBQITa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/exit-planning-will-you-go-down-with-your-business-like-a-sinking-ship/\", \"post_id\": \"11304\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-24 16:46:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-24 16:46:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"exit-planning-will-you-go-down-with-your-business-like-a-sinking-ship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11303\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5527\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Exit-Planning-Will-You-Go-Down-With-Your-Business-Like-a-Sinking-Ship.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"944\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464181200,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Or maybe you have been the one underbidding, which leaves you no room for growth or prosperity.</p><p> If you want to stop competing on price alone, it may be time to develop a stronger differentiation strategy.</p><h3> Differentiation Strategy Defined</h3><p> <br/> There are really only two ways to gain a competitive advantage over your competition. One way is to compete on price, highlighting the similarities you share with your chief competition.</p><p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just as good as our competition, but we cost less.&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, unless you have a sustainable cost advantage, you can&rsquo;t keep up this strategy for long. All it takes is someone willing to undercut your lowest price. The lowest-cost strategy also exposes you to commoditization and a much wider range of competitors, including do-it-yourself approaches, off shoring and automation.</p><p> Another way&mdash;a better way&mdash;is to stand apart. Be different. Separate yourself from the rabble in a way that is important and relevant to potential clients.</p><p> This is what is known as a differentiation strategy.</p><h3> Three Tests for a Successful Differentiator</h3><p> <br/> How do you know you have a good differentiator? Well, we recommend you put each differentiator to the test. If it can pass these three critical checks, it is worth  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/differentiation-guide-for-professional-services-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  developing into a broader differentiation strategy </a> :</p><p> <strong>  1) Is it true? </strong>  You can&rsquo;t just make up claims of differentiation. Apart from the moral hazard of making something up, it is simply too easy for people to see through your exaggerated claims. Your firm has to live it each day. And remember, you&rsquo;ll need to deliver on all claims.</p><p> For example, many firms say they have superior client service but do nothing special to make it a reality. No special policies. No special training. Nothing to ensure it actually happens. The bottom line is they are no different than their competitors making the same claims.</p><p> <strong>  2) Is it relevant? </strong>  Any half-decent differentiator will resonate with prospective clients. If your point of distinction doesn&rsquo;t matter to them, it won&rsquo;t work in getting you more business. More importantly, what is ultimately most important is what plays into their selection criteria and decision making process. Any non-relevant differentiators are wasted effort.</p><p> We once had a client that believed their strongest differentiator was the lack of conflict of interest. Their competitors certainly could not make the same claim. But, when we dug a bit deeper, we realized their clients (both current and target) didn&rsquo;t value the impartiality as highly as the firm did. So much for a strong brand differentiator.</p><p> Going back to our example of client-side service. It is all too common to claim &ldquo;Customer service is our main priority.&rdquo; A lack of customer service may be a reason why you lose a client, but did you know it rarely plays into the initial selection process?</p><p> <strong>  3) Is it provable? </strong>  This is the often the hardest test of a differentiator. You may have identified a true and relevant point of distinction, but it is useless without proof. Even if everyone says a differentiating statement is true, without a way to prove it, it will be ignored.</p><p> &ldquo;We have great people&rdquo; jumps to mind as an example we frequently must dissuade clients for using within their differentiation strategy. It is a trap! Why? Well, have you ever heard a firm claim they have average people?</p><p> Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p><h3> The Challenges of Maintaining a Competitive Advantage</h3><p> <br/> You are well on your way to a solid differentiation strategy once you know what sets you apart from your competitors. Especially if you can explain&mdash;and prove&mdash;it in a way that is relevant to who you want to attract as clients. But, you are still not done.</p><p> The marketplace won&rsquo;t stand still. And your competitors will look to your success and attempt to copy it. Over time, what was once a distinctive characteristic is neutralized. As is your competitive advantage.</p><p> Therefore, a sustainable differentiation strategy requires that you build those distinctive characteristics into your reputation. As such, it becomes the foundation of your  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/seven-big-growth-benefits-that-demonstrate-the-importance-of-branding\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  professional services brand </a> .</p><h3> Why Visible Expertise is So Impactful for Professional Services Firms</h3><p> <br/> This brings us to the topic of expertise and why it is so critical to professional services.</p><p> When you talk about professional services, expertise is what you sell.</p><p> Put another way, clients aren&rsquo;t buying your services because they like them. They are buying your services to solve a problem. Maybe they need help complying with a regulatory requirement or they need a solution to a specific strategic challenge.</p><p> Our research highlights the reasons why a company would select one professional services firm over another. Expertise is the top selection criteria for most prospects, and it is most frequently the factor that tips the scale for the contract-winning firm.</p><p> But what about the argument that professional services are &ldquo;a relationship business&rdquo;? Well, that assumption is true. But when you look at the research, the only factor that trumps a great relationship is expertise.</p><p> As we outline in  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/book-inside-the-buyers-brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Inside the Buyer&rsquo;s Brain </a> , both buyers and sellers of professional services understand the importance of an existing relationship, but sellers consistently underestimate the role their reputation plays in the final selection.</p><p> Also, a strong reputation for expertise is the one factor that can overcome an existing relationship. If a company does not believe their current provider can solve a problem, they will look for someone who can.</p><p> Not long ago, a prospective client came to us for our marketing expertise. He had hired a life-long friend to help with his marketing. Despite their close relationship, he had fired his friend (and hired Hinge) because his friend could not solve his marketing challenge. Our strong reputation for solving the specific marketing challenges of professional services firms was more important then their strong relationship.</p><p> And to add to the argument of expertise as a differentiation strategy, we can look to the latest research on  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/referral-marketing-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  professional services referrals </a> . According to our most recent study of referral marketing, visible expertise plays the single most significant role in driving referrals (37.3% of all referral-driving factors). Relationships, both social and professional are still important, but only when there is an awareness of your expertise.</p><h3> Overcoming the Problem of Invisibility</h3><p> <br/> Developing expertise as a differentiation strategy sounds like a great idea, but there is a catch. Clients are notoriously uninformed when it comes to judging actual expertise. Consequently, your firm&rsquo;s expertise is often unseen by the marketplace.</p><p> And if your firm&rsquo;s expertise is not visible it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p> Fortunately, it is possible to make intangible expertise visible and real.</p><p> We conducted extensive research on highly visible experts and the professional services buyers who hire them. As we outline in  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/programs-services/visible-expert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Visible Expert </a> , there are certain strategies and techniques that work well in elevating the visibility of your expertise in the marketplace.</p><p> Public speaking, writing blog posts and articles, and books are all great ways to demonstrate your expertise. And other strategies and approaches are helpful in boosting the visibility of that expertise, either as a  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/programs-services/visible-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  firm </a>  (or practice within a larger firm) or as an  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/programs-services/visible-expert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  individual </a> . The value of these different techniques, when put together as part of a differentiation strategy, has been proven time and again by our clients that go through either our  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/programs-services/visible-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Visible Firm&reg; </a>  or  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/programs-services/visible-expert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Visible Expert&reg; </a>  programs</p><h3> Building Your Differentiation Strategy</h3><p> <br/> The only proven way of making your expertise visible so that it can work as a differentiator is to have a clear strategy.</p><p> Start with an understanding of exactly what you want to be known for. What are you expert in? Your area of expertise should be broad enough to be enduring and important. But that breadth must be balanced. The narrower and more specialized your expertise, the easier it is to make it visible and defend against potential competitors.</p><p> The next step is research. Research will help you align your firm&rsquo;s offerings with the desires and preferences of potential clients. It will also inform your selection of issues to write about to make your expertise more visible to your target audience. We have found that research of your target client group is associated with growth. In fact, the fastest growing firms (those that grow as much as 20% year over year) are  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/2016-high-growth-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  twice as likely to conduct research </a>  as their no-growth peers.</p><h3> Upon Implementing Your Differentiation Strategy</h3><p> <br/> The research on using expertise as a differentiation strategy is still evolving. We know that highly visible experts accelerate the growth of a firm both by attracting new leads and making it easier to close them as clients. We also know the fastest growing, most profitable firms use strategies and marketing techniques that  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/2016-high-growth-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  raise the visibility of their expertise </a> .</p><p> With a well thought-out strategy and diligent implementation, you&rsquo;ll see your firm&rsquo;s visibility and perceived expertise accelerate. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the average increase in visibility, perceived expertise and new business leads experienced by firms going through the Visible Firm program.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/increase-visibility.png\" width=\"604\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/perceived-expertise.png\" width=\"593\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/growth-in-online-leads.png\" width=\"610\"/></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-25 14:14:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-25 14:14:18.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_3vpdQdq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-visible-expertise-is-so-impactful-for-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"11309\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-25 14:14:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-25 14:14:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-visible-expertise-is-so-impactful-for-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11305\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5528\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-Visible-Expertise-is-So-Impactful-for-Advisors.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"840\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464253200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5308,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Stop Before Defense Stocks Hit All-Time High","link":"stop-before-defense-stocks-hit-all-time-high","source_link":null,"content":"<p> First, it was Stan Druckenmiller, now it&rsquo;s George Soros. Following billionaire former hedge fund manager Druckenmiller&rsquo;s announcement that gold was his family office fund&rsquo;s largest currency allocation, we learned last week that his old boss, billionaire investor George Soros, purchased a $264 million stake in Barrick Gold, the world&rsquo;s largest gold producer, after liquidating $3.5 billion in U.S.-listed stocks. Additionally, he disclosed owning call options on a gold ETF.</p><p> Soros&rsquo; investment can be held up as further proof that sentiment toward gold has decidedly shifted positive, following the challenging last three years.</p><p> London-based precious metals consultancy Metals Focus just released its Gold Focus 2016 report in which the group calls an end to the gold bear market that began in late 2011 after the metal hit its all-time high of $1,900 per ounce. &ldquo;We are optimistic about gold over the rest of this year and our projections see it peaking at $1,350 in the fourth quarter,&rdquo; the group writes. Global negative interest rate policy fears have reawakened investors&rsquo; confidence in gold as a reliable currency and store of value.</p><p> The group adds: &ldquo;In the near term, there may well be some liquidations of tactical positions.&rdquo; This is to be expected, especially at the start of summer, based on historical precedent</p><h3> Will Gold Follow Its Short or Long-Term Trading Pattern?</h3><p> We&rsquo;ve noticed that mining companies which have deleveraged their balance sheets this year have been some of the biggest gainers. Barrick, now Soros&rsquo;s largest U.S.-listed allocation, started 18 months ago.</p><p> Glencore, Teck Resources and higher-risk junior producers such as Gran Colombia bounced off the canvas after being knocked down.</p><p> Gold equities always have a higher beta than bullion. Usually, a &plusmn;1 percent move translates into 2 to 3 percent in gold stocks.</p><p> Regardless of it being a bull or bear market, there are still fairly predictable intra-year trends in the price of gold. Below is an updated composite chart of the metal&rsquo;s historical yearly patterns over the last five, 15 and 30 years, courtesy of Moore Research.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Golds-Composite-Historical-Patterns.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> In all periods, gold contracted in May to early summer, then rallied in anticipation of Ramadan&mdash;this year beginning June 4&mdash;and India&rsquo;s festival of lights and wedding season. India has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, and for at least 5,000 years they&rsquo;ve adhered to the tradition of giving gold as gifts during religious and other celebrations.</p><p> Predictably so, the yellow metal has retreated somewhat this month, following its best start to a year in 30 years and its best-ever first quarter for demand. As I told Daniela Cambone during last week&rsquo;s Gold Game Film, this pullback provides an attractive buying opportunity</p><p> The five-year period decoupled from the other two starting in mid-autumn, but the annual losses in 2013 (when the yellow metal fell 28 percent), 2014 and 2015 skewed the data. Metals Focus sees gold following its more typical trading pattern this year, possibly climbing to as high as $1,350 an ounce.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Quarterly-Gold-Price-Forecast.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> In the near-term, gold is threatened by a rate hike, possibly as early as next month&rsquo;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The metal fell to a three-week low this week on hawkish Fed minutes. If the Fed ends up delaying a hike, it could give gold the chance to take off.</p><h3> Analysts See a Possible 25 Percent Depreciation in China&rsquo;s Currency</h3><p> One of the concerns the Fed has right now is the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi. In a special report, CLSA estimates it could fall as much as 25 percent before rebounding somewhat. Because the trade volume with China is so massive, the fear is that it could affect the U.S. economy.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CLSAs-Renminbi-Exchange-Rate-Forecast.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> This would have many obvious negative consequences. For one, because China&rsquo;s oil contracts with the Middle East are denominated in renminbi, not dollars, Middle East suppliers would be hurt.</p><p> CLSA points to several winners, however, including investors. The devaluation could very well &ldquo;represent the best opportunity to buy Chinese assets that investors have had since the financial crisis,&rdquo; the investment banking firm writes. China&rsquo;s materials sector, local exporting producers and mainland gold producers should also benefit. The renminbi will &ldquo;inevitably&rdquo; fall, CLSA says, &ldquo;irrespective of economic fundamentals, as a free market works out what it is worth.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s little wonder then that, in the meantime, the country&rsquo;s consumption of gold has skyrocketed in recent years as it vies to become one of the world&rsquo;s key gold price makers. (Remember, China just introduced a new  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/china-still-the-worlds-number-one-heavy-metal-rock-star/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  renminbi-denominated gold fix price </a> .)</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mainland-China-Official-Gold-Bullion-Imports.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> In addition, it was reported last week that Chinese bank ICBC Standard just purchased one of Europe&rsquo;slargest gold vaults from Barclays, located in London, for $90 billion. This will help give the country greater control over gold transactions around the world, about $5 trillion of which are cleared in London every year</p><h3> Should They Stay or Should They Go?</h3><p> Likely to help gold this summer are geopolitical events, specifically the potential &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; next month when U.K. voters decide on whether to remain members of or leave the European Union.</p><p> Various analysts have warned that such an event could trigger a crisis with both the euro and pound, which might spread to other economies. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey found, in fact, that the idea of a Brexit has risen to the top of global investors&rsquo; worries. What&rsquo;s more, no consensus was reached during a meeting among G7 nations this past weekend on how to deal with fiscal policy, other than to take a &ldquo;go your own way&rdquo; approach.</p><p> In the past, gold has been used as a hedge against the risk of not only negative interest rates but also inflation.</p><p> High inflation might also be coming to the U.S. thanks to the Labor Department&rsquo;s new regulation on overtime pay, which doubles the eligibility threshold from $23,660 a year to $47,476 a year, on condition that the worker puts in more than 40 hours a week. It&rsquo;s estimated that the ruling will affect 2.2 million retail and restaurant workers, among others.</p><p> President Barack Obama&rsquo;s heart is certainly in the right place by wanting to boost workers&rsquo; wages. But it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the unintended consequences that have often accompanied such sweeping edicts throughout history. We could end up with rampant inflation as companies will have little choice but to raise prices to offset the increased expense. Again, having part of your portfolio invested in gold and gold stocks, as much as 10 percent, could help counterbalance inflationary pressures on your wealth.</p><h3> Defense Stocks Hit All-Time Highs on Terrorism Jitters</h3><p> Global fears of terrorism persist, of course, with a Cairo-bound EgyptAir flight crashing in the Mediterranean Sea last week. Although the cause of the crash is not clear at this point, officials have not ruled out terrorism. In light of this and other tragedies&mdash;the attacks in Belgium, for instance&mdash;defense and military stocks have made huge moves in recent weeks. Shares of Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and L-3 Communications all hit all-time highs the week before last.</p><p> In a recent call, an analyst with Cornerstone Macro predicted that a presidential victory for Donald Trump would be good for defense stocks as he&rsquo;s made promises to &ldquo;rebuild&rdquo; the military should he make it into the White House.

By definition, only after an experience will we become wise. This is why only our older, eh-hem, wiser selves can look back to our youth and say, &ldquo;wear sunscreen,&rdquo; &ldquo;take care of your body,&rdquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go out with Chad,&rdquo; or &ldquo;prioritize date night.\"</p><p> When it comes to planning for your future, rather than relying on your own wisdom &ndash; which comes after-the-fact &ndash; rely on the experiences of others instead. Although your 20-year old self couldn't see the inevitable damage of any SPF, your current self can wise up to an issue your future self is highly likely to experience: long-term care.</p><p> Long-term care provides support when you are unable to do two out of six activities of daily living (such as bathing and dressing). 70% of people turning age 65 will expect to use some form of long-term care during their lives. The healthier you are, the higher the chance that you will need help over your (expected) longer lifetime. Yet, having a long-term care game plan is one that many of us don&rsquo;t want to face. We get it. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine being dependent on others for our own care and, if we can, it&rsquo;s too uncomfortable to entertain for long. Instead, we plan for other, more palatable expenses like college funding. Although long-term care costs vary by state, in certain states like California the cost of full-time help could be more than a 4-year education. Absent proper planning, the burden of care will fall on children and loved ones. Watching loved one's age is an emotional expense alone. A plan to help cover the financial costs should be just as important as college funding.</p><p> A long-term care plan may include self-insuring if you have enough income or assets to cover the expense, assigning the risk to an insurance company by purchasing a long-term care policy, or a combination of both. To allow time to accumulate assets dedicated to this need and to help keep insurance costs down, we recommend that you begin planning for long-term care needs in your mid-40s or early 50s. Don&rsquo;t let your 80-year-old self say, &ldquo;if I knew then what I know now&rdquo; about long-term care. Work with your financial advisor to get a plan in place or email us if you need help.</p><h3> MAKING SENSE: <br/>  </h3><p> The Wealth Effect: An idea that investors feel wealthier when the value of their investment portfolios rises, making them inclined to spend more.

{"original_id":5311,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want To Go Beyond Leadership? Teach and Inspire... Here's How!","link":"want-to-go-beyond-leadership-teach-and-inspire-heres-how","source_link":null,"content":"<p> No one wants to work, day in and day out, carrying out meaningless tasks that feed the passion and vision of someone else. People want to feel engaged in work that is meaningful to them, where they know they are adding value. When you focus on the task of leadership, you often alienate your employees. As a leader, you have a unique opportunity to step beyond leadership and become a teacher. When you serve your employees in a teaching role, you inspire and engage them. So, how can you step up your leadership to teach and inspire?</p><h3> Offer challenge</h3><p> Talented employees want to be challenged and engaged. They don&rsquo;t want all the answers and every solution provided for them. They want the opportunity to identify problems, tackle issues, and make decisions related to their work for themselves. When you offer challenges to your employees, not only do you show that you trust them but, you make their work more exciting; when their work is more exciting they become more engaged; and, when they are engaged they are eager to learn new skills and gain new knowledge.</p><h3> Provide meaning</h3><p> Employees need to find meaning in their work. They need to know that their contribution is making a difference. This cannot be your meaning; work must be meaningful to employees on an individual basis. They need to see the big picture and understand the important role they play in that big picture. When employees feel that their work is meaningful, motivation switches from external to internal. Meaningful work provides inspiration, and inspiration motivates employees to put more effort into their performance. High performing employees are always looking for ways to develop and to learn which improves themselves, the team, and the organization.</p><h3> Support growth</h3><p> Employees want opportunities to grow. When you serve in the role of a teacher you invest your time and resources into helping others become the best they can be. Growth requires exposure to new experiences, continual training, opportunities to use new knowledge and skills, and the leeway to fail and learn from that failure. The more employees grow, the greater their potential for future growth and the greater their contribution to the organization.</p><h3> Share vision</h3><p> At the end of the day, successful leaders are the ones who effectively lay out their vision and then get employees to buy into that vision heart and soul. When you serve employees as a teacher and a mentor, you inspire them to make your vision their own. With a shared vision, employees become more dedicated, teams become more committed, and the organization thrives.</p><h3> Teach and Inspire</h3><p> Effective leadership goes beyond dictating and directing employees and tasks. It requires stepping beyond the traditional role of the transactional leader to that of a teacher. When you become a teacher and mentor who offers challenge, provides meaning, supports growth, and shares vision you inspire your employees. And, inspired employees will take pride in their work, they will respect the goals of the organization, and they will give 110% in pursuit of those goals.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-25 16:05:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-25 16:05:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_gbM7Axj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-to-go-beyond-leadership-teach-and-inspire-heres-how/\", \"post_id\": \"11320\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-25 16:05:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-25 16:05:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-to-go-beyond-leadership-teach-and-inspire-heres-how\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11321\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5532\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Want-To-Go-Beyond-Leadership-Teach-and-Inspire-Heres-How.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"659\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464256800,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

She brought such complete attention, that in her presence I could see his confidence expand. He stood taller. He played with more passion. It was as if she had the power to light him up from within.</p><p> This past weekend, as my kiddo was reacquainted with his keyboard and asked me to listen to him play every song he could remember, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of my friend Alise. My friend Alise visited last year and was, to date, his best audience yet. While I knew she was amazing, I couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated the impact she would have on my son.  The night she visited, after dinner, Jeremy decided to put on a concert. He played through his repertoire and we ooooh&rsquo;d and ahhhhh&rsquo;d and clapped in all the appropriate places.</p><p> After about 20  minutes into his concert, my husband and I grew restless, and retired into the living room (we had, after all, heard the same songs over-and-over-and-over again), but not Alise. She drew closer. Brandy in hand, she nestled into the hammock chair beside Jeremy&rsquo;s keyboard and gave him her full attention.  &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it magnificent how my fingers can do this?&rdquo; he said, playing as fast as he could play, his confidence soaring as his humility wavered. &ldquo;Yes!  It is magnificent!&rdquo; she replied. My husband and I sat laughing quietly in the living room as his music filled the air.</p><p> I remember sneaking in, a few minutes later, and watching them &ndash; my friend, rapt with attention, listening so intently to my child playing with such gusto. I recognized that look in his eyes; I had seen it before.</p><p> He felt seen.</p><p> When I teach, it&rsquo;s the same look I see in my participants&rsquo; eyes when I&rsquo;m talking with them one-on-one. When someone gives us their full attention &ndash; really sees us &ndash; it makes all the difference. Suddenly, the confidence we didn&rsquo;t know we had comes to the surface, our natural abilities strengthened, passion unleashed.  We feel more powerful. Able. Ready. When we feel truly seen, our best comes easily. There&rsquo;s not a greater gift you can give someone than to give them your full attention.

And THIS!&rdquo;</p><h3> Focused attention can fuel even greater performance. <br/>  </h3><p> Think about it from a leadership perspective. If your job is to ensure you&rsquo;re are getting the best from the people you lead, to meet the goals of your organization, is there anything more important?  What could your results be if the people on your team were truly confident, if they were leveraging their natural abilities, and brought passion to work?  If they felt powerful? In a world where we&rsquo;re going a million-miles-an-hour all day long, balancing 20 different things, with competing priorities and deadlines looming, it&rsquo;s hard to give our full attention to anything or anyone.  But maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;s worth trying.</p><h3> These days, it&rsquo;s hard to give our full attention to anything or anyone.

{"original_id":5313,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Important Keys to Articulating Your Value in Business","link":"3-important-keys-to-articulating-your-value-in-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> With major regulatory changes and the emergence of robo-advisors in the fintech world, now more than ever in history has it been more important for financial advisors to be able to clearly articulate what clients pay and what clients get for what they pay.</p><p> In other words, &ldquo;how do you explain to a client, what I pay in dollar terms and what I get in value terms? The three keys in articulating your value are processes. As the saying goes, the three keys to success in real estate are location, location, location. In practice management for financial advisors, the three keys to success are process, process, process. The advisors who have proven processes to articulate their value do significantly better than advisors who lack critical processes.</p><h3> Getting clarity, the first key</h3><p> <br/> Getting clarity around what you do and your process to deliver value, you must have a documented process. To answer the question what do I get for $5000, $10,000 or more per year? In workshops, when I ask advisors the question, what do I get for $10,000 per year, most are answering the question off the top of their mind. The next question in the workshop helps them get more clarity. The next question is&rdquo; what do I get for $20,000 per year?&rdquo; Usually, it is the same answer as the last one and comes off the top of their mind. This is where clarity comes in. It is not the amount that I pay, it is the value I receive for what I pay. Do you have it in writing and can you clearly articulate what value I receive? Building a value promise document is the first process to help advisors clearly articulate the value clients receive and your process to deliver it. This is an ongoing process, so you can constantly improve the value you deliver and deliver more and more value. Start by putting it in writing.</p><h3> The written process, the second key</h3><p> After the process is documented, you must have it scripted for clarity .Once you have the value that you deliver to clients in writing, have it scripted or written out so you can hear how it sounds as if you were a client. Does it make an impact on <br/> you, or does it sound like something every other advisor would say? What questions do you ask to help people get clarity around their finances and goals? What type of outcomes am I looking for and willing to pay for as a result of your work? For the most part, we think it is our job to ask questions and for clients to supply the answers. But what happens when the tables are turned? Would we make any sense? Or would our answers tumble out incomplete and unclear? <br/> Your value promise document takes on the seldom considered idea that your clients ask an awful lot of questions. Simply put, the questions of your clients reveal what is important to them, what they want, what they wanted to know of us and from us, and what they want to happen, the outcomes they are searching for. Their questions reveal their greatest intents. Ultimately, though, the questions of our clients reveal what we ourselves should be asking. That is if we are brave enough. Are we?</p><h3> Clarity through conversations, the third key</h3><p> <br/> In my workshops, I ask advisors to write down three to five things of value, your best clients are willing to pay for and holds great value to them. Rarely if ever, advisors write down what I consider three critical words to explain their value. The words are conversations, exercises or discussions. No matter what you call it, having key conversations with clients about important areas in their life so they can gain clarity is valuable. The value is in the conversations (or call them exercises or discussions) you have. Think about this. One of your values is to help people gain clarity around their financial goals for their future, through your conversation. Can people do it on their own? Yes. Do their get a deeper understanding of their financial goals and put it down on paper. Sometimes. Do they sit down with their spouse and get clarity around where they are going together? They gain a deeper, more objective insight into where they have been and the new direction that will bring clarity to their lives. Again, the value is in the conversation. I would encourage you to ask this question. Would it be valuable to get clarity around your goals for the future and put it on paper ?</p><p> With the rise of #fintech and robo advisors, how many of them would be able to have a valuable conversation or discussion to help people gain financial clarity? Start by getting clarity around the value you deliver for clients and put it on paper. Then clearly articulate it and describe your value. Part of your value is in your conversations. Now you have the three keys to articulating your value, which will give your clients and prospects more clarity, and more importantly, you.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-25 16:13:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-25 16:13:11.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_NbHlrDQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-important-keys-to-articulating-your-value-in-business/\", \"post_id\": \"11325\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-25 16:13:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-25 16:13:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-important-keys-to-articulating-your-value-in-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11324\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5534\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3-Important-Keys-to-Articulating-Your-Value-in-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1785\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464249600,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

The next step consists of creating a clear vision.In his book &ldquo;Principle Centered Leadership,&rdquo; Steven Covey shares valuable insight on how to create your mission statement. Specifically, he shared that your mission statement  should include &ldquo;&hellip; four basic human needs: economic or money, social or relationship, psychological or growth, and spiritual or contribution.&rdquo;When your mission and vision statement is based on universal principles it remains stable with the changes of outside circumstances. A principle based statement should include: values of your firm, the <a href=\"http://pma360.com/financial-advisor-business-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> niche market</a> you serve, products and services you offer, how you offer your product or service and how you give back. Let&rsquo;s dive into the 7 steps on how to create a mission statement.<h3> Step 1: Identify the core values of your business</h3>Roy Disney said it so well, &ldquo;When your values are clear to you, making decisions becomes easier.&rdquo; This is why clarifying your values in your small business, consultant or financial services marketing plan is so powerful.<h3> Get clarity on the values that govern your consulting or financial services firm and life.</h3>From the list below, identify &amp; circle your top four values:FunRelationshipsHonestyLearningConnectionVolunteer WorkEducationFitnessBalanceSpiritual ConnectionAdviceCreatingServingTeachingCompassionFinancial Security<h3> Step 2: Identify the niche market you serve</h3>Be as specific as possible in <a href=\"http://pma360.com/copper/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> identifying your ideal niche market</a>, for example non-traditional affluent women is a better niche market description than women. Anesthesiologists is better than doctors.<h3> Step 3: What do you aspire to achieve?</h3>For example you may want to provide a financial literacy legacy for non-traditional affluent women. Or assist anesthesiologists in creating financial freedom so they can retire in the lifestyle for which they have become accustom.<h3> Step 4: What roles do you provide to your niche market?</h3>The next step on how to create your mission steps requires that you get clear on what services you provide to your ideal client. Examples may include life planning, life coaching, business coaching, small business consulting, budgeting support, risk assessments, risk management, tax planning, insurance analysis, financial analysis and financial planning, investment planning and/or estate planning.Other services may include bookkeeper or concierge services, animal care, cosmetic, medical or dental referrals, travel agencies, and anything else your affluent clients desire.<h3> Step 5: Write a draft mission statement for your practice.</h3><h3> Step 6: Confirm that your draft statement compliments your purpose and &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</h3><h3> Step 7: Write a final mission statement for your financial services firm.</h3>For example: PMA360.com provides solutions to transform your business and life.

But, with so many other Financial Advisors taking on the digital world, having a website simply just isn&rsquo;t enough anymore.</p><p> Think of it this way: If you were to open a retail store, would you expect that just because you opened a store, people will flock to it, and you will experience instant success? Of course not. You have to work on building your inventory, increasing your visibility, and marketing and advertising it.</p><p> Similarly, just because you have a website, doesn&rsquo;t mean that clients and prospects know about it or can find you. Just like opening your own retail store, you need to continuously build your websites inventory (content), spread awareness and visibility (SEO), and market and advertise it. The more active you are digital, the stronger your website (and your business) will be.</p><p> As a Financial Advisor: you can&rsquo;t assume that because you have a website, people know about it.</p><p> Constantly updating your website creates two key benefits:</p><h3> 1. Your visitors are happier and more engaged</h3><p> Having new and fresh content will not only engage your current audience, but it will motivate them to keep coming back. Continuously updated content will ensure that you have repeat visitors and subscribers (if you have an opt-in option for visitors who enjoy your content). Also, if they are engaged and happy, the chances of them sharing your website with others greatly increases, which in return could increase your websites total visibility (and hopefully client base).</p><p> As a Financial Advisor, the financial services industry is continuously changing &ndash; from new policies and regulations to changes in season. If your content and information are out-dated, your audience will get little value out of it, which could affect the perception of your brand and practice. Frequently updating and adding content, especially content that is aimed to solve your prospect and client challenges, can help you build credibility and trust with your visitors while increasing your digital visibility.</p><h3> 2. Search engines LOVE dynamic content</h3><p> When content, on your website, is continuously added and updated, that means that your website is constantly changing &ndash; it&rsquo;s dynamic. When search engine crawlers come to your website to audit if anything has been updated or added, they report their findings back to Google to determine your ranking on their search engine. By updating your website, a crawler&rsquo;s report back would be something along the lines of &ldquo;Yes, this is an important website because it&rsquo;s frequently updated with fresh, useful and good quality content.&rdquo;</p><p> So, why should you care? This means that Google will send crawlers to your website more frequently, helping you rank higher for keywords that you may be focusing on to reach your target audience.  As a result, this will help increase your websites visibility and attract more prospects to your website.</p><p> As a Financial Advisor, you need to think about different ways you can get found, capture your traffic and keep those who have left your website, coming back. Take a minute and ask yourself:</p><li> When was the last time I updated my website?</li><li> When was the last time I wrote a blog for my website?</li><li> Does my website rank highly at all for words or phrases like &ldquo;Financial Advisor, Toronto&rdquo;?</li><li> What kinds of words or phrases would my target audience be writing in a search engine that could lead them to my website?</li><p> It is important to think about these questions as you are building your online presence. Whether you write a new blog, update your information, or add a new widget, take some time out of your day to update your website. Remember that continuously updating your website will greatly benefit your digital presence in the long run and more easily connect you with your future clients.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-25 16:40:10.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-25 16:40:10.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_EjHYAnJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-why-having-a-website-isnt-enough-anymore-and-what-you-need-to-do/\", \"post_id\": \"11327\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-25 16:40:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-25 16:40:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-why-having-a-website-isnt-enough-anymore-and-what-you-need-to-do\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11328\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5536\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Advisors-Why-Having-a-Website-Isnt-Enough-Anymore-and-What-You-Need-to-Do.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"659\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464264000,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}

Listen up, everyone. There is an incorrect perception that social media is for teeny boppers and millennials who are broke and are wandering around jobless.

They&rsquo;ve already heard the marketing pitch before and they can see you coming a mile away. So if you want to get their attention, stop product pitching and start captivating, start intriguing.

{"original_id":5317,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"To Disclose or Not to Disclose on Form U4, That is the Question","link":"disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question","source_link":null,"content":"<p>When a financial advisor is contemplating a move to a new firm, there are times when questions arise as to whether he should or should not disclose negative events from his past on his Form U4. If there is ever any question about whether a disclosure to a prospective employer should be made, it is almost always better to err on the side of caution and make the disclosure. This is especially important in today&rsquo;s hyper-vigilant compliance environment. Sometimes, a failure to disclose even the most mundane or long forgotten youthful indiscretions could lead to career-damning consequences, essentially costing the advisor his job and the potential of being banned from the securities industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to 2015, FINRA would bring direct actions against advisors who falsified or failed to set forth reportable events on their Form U4. In FINRA&rsquo;s new Rule 3110(e), heightened burdens were placed on broker-dealers (&ldquo;BDs&rdquo;) to monitor both new employees and existing ones on an ongoing basis. What that means is that today, firms are required to undertake much more in depth background checks and reviews on all of their advisors or suffer the consequences. Moreover, within 30 days after a new U4 is filed, the BD must &ldquo;verify the accuracy and completeness of the information&rdquo; provided by the financial advisor on the U4. From a practical perspective, firms are now &ndash; more than ever &ndash; digging deeper into a prospective advisor&rsquo;s past and the expectation that the advisor will be 100% honest and forthright when providing information in anticipation of becoming employed or affiliating with a new BD are significantly greater.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>So, what types of events are &ldquo;reportable&rdquo; ones that warrant mandatory disclosure?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These range from being charged with a felony or certain types of misdemeanors that involve investments, investment-related businesses, fraud, wrongful taking of property, perjury and other similar offenses that go to the good character of an advisor. Issues surrounding bankruptcies and compromises with creditors will not disqualify an advisor from being licensed or affiliating with a firm, but they must be timely disclosed. Any civil litigation settled for more than $15,000 and any civil judgment must be disclosed, as well as any types of liens and judgments or regulatory actions regarding other professional licenses (e.g., being suspended from the practice of law), also must be set forth in Section 14 of the U4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seemingly, reporting these types of events would appear rather cut and dry, and lead all advisors to make the necessary disclosures; but unfortunately, this is not always the case. Many believe that what was thought to be a minor transgression&ndash; such as pleading guilty to shoplifting while in college, passing a bad check, being arrested for possessing a small amount of cocaine or declaring bankruptcy many years ago &ndash; do not need to be reported. However, this cannot be further from the truth. The operative word in the Form U4 for these events is &ldquo;ever&rdquo;&mdash;as in, &ldquo;Have you ever been charged with a felony?&rdquo; Even if the charges were dismissed, they still must be disclosed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have worked with too many terminated advisors who failed to report an expunged drug arrest from their early twenties because they were assured by the court or their attorney at the time that the offense occurred &ldquo;was off their record&rdquo;. The cold hard fact is that &ndash; for purposes of an advisor&rsquo;s Form U4 disclosure obligations &ndash; these events stay with the individual like a bad haircut that never seems to grow out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The past isn&rsquo;t really in the past: Finding out the hard way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently worked with a young advisor from a wirehouse in the Northeast. &ldquo;Tim&rdquo; was 38 years old, producing in excess of $1.4 million dollars annually and had been hired by his firm in mid-2015 after being paid a sizeable recruiting deal. Earlier this year, he was called into his manager&rsquo;s office where he was met by members of the firm&rsquo;s compliance department. After doing a post-hire check on Tim, it was discovered that he failed to report that he had been found guilty in his early twenties of writing a bad check for $300 (a felony in the jurisdiction where he went to college). While he eventually made full restitution for the bad check and was able to enter and complete a pre-trial intervention program, he was still required to disclose the matter to his firm. He also failed to report that 7 years earlier, when his condominium was close to being foreclosed upon, he arranged with his lender to sign back the unit and walk away from the balance of his mortgage (a deed in lieu of foreclosure). Any type of compromise with a creditor (occurring within 10 years of filling out the Form U4) must be disclosed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact that Tim&rsquo;s compliance record was otherwise clean, he was terminated on the spot from his firm for these disclosure failures. The termination, and the circumstances causing it became a black mark for Tim. Subsequently, he was unable to obtain employment with any other top or even second tier firm and was forced to accept an offer from a small local broker-dealer. And, to boot, he is responsible for repaying the yet unforgiven significant portion of the recruiting bonus he had received from his former firm in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A financial advisor&rsquo;s failure to disclose material events from his past, regardless of the amount of time that has elapsed or the perceived inconsequential nature of the offense, could very well derail his career. Extreme care and transparency about one&rsquo;s past must be the top of mind when completing or supplementing Form U4. If there is any question as to whether an event should be disclosed, it is good practice to consult with an attorney who practices in this area of law. But, when in doubt, always disclose.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-25 17:36:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-25 17:36:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_pnhHWTn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/to-disclose-or-not-to-disclose-on-form-u4-that-is-the-question/\", \"post_id\": \"11332\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-25 17:36:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-25 17:36:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"to-disclose-or-not-to-disclose-on-form-u4-that-is-the-question\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11331\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5538\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/To-Disclose-or-Not-to-Disclose-on-Form-U4-That-is-the-Question.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"10265\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":38177,"author_id":198,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5318,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Millennials: Five Business Etiquette Tips You All Need to Know","link":"millennials-five-business-etiquette-tips-you-all-need-to-know","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s amazing to me how many younger people there are in the workforce these days. I guess that means I&rsquo;m getting old. According to statistics by the Pew Research Center, millennials now make up the majority of the workforce. In 2015, they surpassed Baby Boomers and Gen Xers in the number of workers.</p><p> Millennials bring many assets to the workforce including digital smarts &ndash; having grown up with tech tools at their disposal.  They are also ambitious and innovative. But there are downsides to these traits as well. Millennials&rsquo; reliance on their digital tools can be annoying and off-putting to others. Their ambition and restlessness can seem brash to those generations who patiently put their time in to get to where they are in their careers. Millennials can avoid generational clashes by being mindful of a few etiquette tips that seem to particularly apply to their generation.</p><h3> 1. Be More Formal with Your Technology Tools</h3><p> Yes, I know your phone is another appendage, but it still has its place. Don&rsquo;t look at or use your phone when you&rsquo;re meeting with others. It&rsquo;s like turning your back to someone when they are talking to you.</p><p> Treat emails like a business letter rather than a text message. Include a greeting (&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yo&rdquo;) and a closing (&ldquo;Best regards,&rdquo; &ldquo;Best,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sincerely&rdquo;). Avoid using abbreviations. Spell words out. And, avoid casual language like, &ldquo;you guys,&rdquo; &ldquo;no worries&rdquo; or &ldquo;dude.&rdquo;</p><p> When it comes to texting, avoid sending texts to your clients or your boss unless they have specified that it&rsquo;s okay to do so. Texts are very casual and somewhat invasive, so you should only send them to people you know fairly well and who are comfortable receiving texts. Always ask first if you&rsquo;re not sure if texting someone would be okay. And, be a little more formal when you write your texts.</p><h3> 2. Be Punctual</h3><p> It&rsquo;s a sign of respect when you show up on time. And, when you&rsquo;re late you could miss out on important information or risk not being included because of your tardiness.</p><h3> 3. Be Respectful of People with More Authority</h3><p> Yes, you have fresh, innovative ideas, but many of the older folks you work with have years of experience and knowledge. Be respectful of that.</p><h3> 4. Share Your Opinion but Be Humble</h3><p> Rather than assuming you know everything, listen and watch. It takes time to understand a company&rsquo;s history, nuances, and culture. Allow yourself time to get the lay of the land or the gist of the meeting before you jump in with your opinion. And when you do share your opinion, be complimentary of others&rsquo; contributions.</p><h3> 5.

{"original_id":5319,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Customer Experience Measurement is Extremely Important (but Poorly Done)","link":"customer-experience-measurement-is-extremely-important-but-poorly-done","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When it comes to the profession that Customer Experience has now become, one of the most important and significant competencies required by all organisations is that of measurement.</p><p> The ability of a company to robustly and continuously capture a &lsquo;fact-based&rsquo; understanding of how capable they are of meeting customer needs and expectations is critical if they have a desire to achieve customer-focused success.</p><p> However&hellip;. There is usually one of those, whilst many businesses may be confident that they are indeed &lsquo;measuring&rsquo; the Customer Experience, my overwhelming concern is that too many are doing so badly. I recognise that this is a rather bold statement to be making, so allow me to clarify my top 4 reasons why I think this:</p><h3> 1. Failure to measure sufficient &lsquo;voices&rsquo;!</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"822\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Measurement-Your-Customer-Experience.png\" width=\"1054\"/></p><p> I believe that the most robust Customer Experience measurement systems should contain a combination of three important &lsquo;voices&rsquo;- Voice of the Customer (VOC); Voice of the Employee (VOE); and Voice of the Process (VOP). Many organisations are (and have been) measuring VOC for a number of years. Although this is important, VOC in isolation of any other form of measurement may not enable those capturing it to understand the relationship between the things they do (processes that enable the customer journey) and the way they make the customer feel (customer perception). If this is the case, determining exactly WHAT it is that needs to be &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; to improve customer perception is challenging (and sometimes impossible).</p><p> Over the years, I have interacted with a number of organisations who capture VOC (and VOC alone) yet do not understand what they are supposed to do with it &ndash; what prioritised actions should be taken. If these businesses were complementing and correlating their VOC with VP and VOE, they would be in a very different position.</p><h3> 2. Failure to measure the true &lsquo;end to end&rsquo; customer journey</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Failure-to-measure-true-end-to-end-customer-journey.png\" width=\"543\"/></p><p> The theme of &lsquo;not measuring sufficient voices&rsquo; continues in my next assessment of the state of Customer Experience measurement today. Whilst many companies are capturing at least VOC, too often, the VOC they are capturing is NOT representative of the &lsquo;end to end&rsquo; customer journey &ndash; and sometimes of all types of customer. If you are only asking customers about a part or parts or the customer journey, the feedback being received will only be representative of the parts you are asking them about &ndash; it is not rocket science.</p><p> Despite this, I have observed too many scenarios where the measurement system is not representative and as a result, an organisation in this position is likely to do one thing &ndash; JUMP TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION! It is so important to get to the TRUTH with Customer Experience measurement &ndash; nothing else matters than having a clear understanding of the things that need to be addressed to have the greatest effect on improving customer perception and as a result, commercial goals. One thing I can say with certainty &ndash; if your customer metric looks too good to be true &ndash; it probably is!</p><h3> 3. Failure to align business process to the customer journey</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Organisational-Layers-of-CX_0.png\" width=\"786\"/></p><p> The most robust Customer Experience measurement systems are structured by correlating business processes with the customer journey. If we think of all organisations as a combination of &lsquo;layers&rsquo;, whilst the top layer is the customer journey, the middle layer is made up of business processes. It is a business&rsquo;s processes that enable the customer journey to happen. The third layer comprises the technology that enables business processes to deliver the customer journey&hellip;. Are you still with me?!</p><p> For a business to be &lsquo;focused&rsquo; on knowing WHAT to address to improve the customer journey &ndash; in other words, to be able to narrow down to a small number of priorities &ndash; it must be able to measure &lsquo;CAUSE and EFFECT&rsquo;. If you measure how capable business processes are at doing what they need to do (the CAUSE), as they improve, you should see an improvement in the way customers feel about what you do (the EFFECT). This principle only works on two conditions &ndash; a) you measure all business processes that enable the delivery of the customer journey; and b) your business processes are ALIGNED to the customer journey.</p><p> In my experience, so many companies designed and implemented business process (and technology for that matter) without even knowing that the customer journey existed, too often, business processes do NOT align to the customer journey. As a result, it is difficult (and sometimes impossible) to correlate a change in the performance of processes with customer feedback. Getting this right &ndash; enabling the relationship between process and customer journey is perhaps the most powerful way of understanding how to improve the customer experience (based on fact).</p><h3> 4. Failure to take ACTION</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/which-will-it-be.jpg\" width=\"610\"/></p><p> Failing to take ACTION on Customer Experience measurement is a BIG mistake to make. It is more common to see this being the case than you may imagine. All over the world, business leaders seem unsure as to whether or not they should be using measurement as the carrot or the stick! In reality, neither of these analogies is appropriate (in my opinion).</p><p> When it comes to Customer Experience Measurement, the number &ndash; an NPS score for example (which some may see as either the carrot or the stick) &ndash; is not the sole reason for measuring. Regularly I come across leaders who are focussed on the score and the score alone &ndash; almost obsessively. I do believe that a score is important &ndash; to link to business strategy and to act as a &lsquo;talisman&rsquo; for everyone to follow, BUT unless you know what to do with the measurement being captured, it is POINTLESS.</p><p> There are more examples I could add of what I consider to be &lsquo;bad&rsquo; examples of Customer Experience measurement &ndash; but rather than me rambling on, I would love for you to add your reasons by commenting on this article. As a profession, it is the responsibility of Customer Experience Professionals all over the world to educate businesses how to measure the Customer Experience well &ndash; I hope you will take some time to add your expertise for others to learn from!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-25 17:48:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-25 17:48:06.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_C3Svlrt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/customer-experience-measurement-is-extremely-important-but-poorly-done/\", \"post_id\": \"11339\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-25 17:48:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-25 17:48:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"customer-experience-measurement-is-extremely-important-but-poorly-done\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11340\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5540\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Customer-Experience-Measurement-is-Extremely-Important-but-Poorly-Done.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"939\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464282000,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5320,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Risky Business: Why Calmer Thinking Prevails in Employee Relations","link":"risky-business-why-calmer-thinking-prevails-in-employee-relations","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There are a few different profiles when it comes to organizational risk as it pertains to Employee Relations. You have the organizations that slap-happy risky. These are the companies that do whatever they want without regard for consequences. They expect employee claims and suits to come against them, but that doesn&rsquo;t move them much. Often times, these companies have money &ndash; making it even easier for them to settle a dispute and move on somewhat unscathed.</p><p> On the other end of the spectrum, you have the risk-averse organizations who would rather die than to be sued by an employee. These companies mean well, but their approach to ER issues are equally as damaging as the slap-happy risky companies. Their penchant for going above and beyond to avoid and/or remedy claims or conflict is admirable &ndash; yet not a surefire way for eradicating the possibility of any future ER issues.</p><p> Employee claims will happen. </p><p> Try as you may, someone in your organization will make a claim on you at some point. The key is to not panic and plan your next step from a place of fear.</p><p> I am often perplexed when I see people with zero stomach for having to relay difficult messages or dealing with litigious matters in Employee Relations positions. Why would you do that to someone? Better yet, why would you do that to your organization?</p><p> There are places for the meek in every organization. I&rsquo;m not sure that Employee Relations is the place where I would place really nice, but indecisive people. Conversely, it isn&rsquo;t the place for bull-headed individuals either. Decisive, critical-thinking, and calm are just some of the necessary attributes that come to mind when I think of the nature of the work in Employee Relations.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><p> Recently, I heard from someone who was finishing up an investigation regarding a manager and employee at odds. The final disposition report was written up and submitted to the general counsel at the company. Due to some of the risque findings and the level of the manager, general counsel suggested that the actual findings be kept separate from the final report. He also asked for &ldquo;tweaking&rdquo; of some of the wording in the final report.</p><p> This tampering with the investigation write-up was not solid advice. One of the two investigators were part of the risk-averse family and panicked. Off he went revising the language of this report from what was intended to something more &ldquo;frilly&rdquo; and less harsh.</p><p> It was the second investigator that questioned the revisions to the report &ndash; only to get concurrence from general counsel that it was both necessary and right to leave the report as-is. Granted the guidance from general counsel was not clear, but if something doesn&rsquo;t seem right &ndash; do we not ask questions or make better suggestions?</p><p> Some may argue that it was risky to question the general counsel&rsquo;s order, but the reality is the employee being affected by her manager&rsquo;s behavior would file a lawsuit in a heartbeat if somehow all that she claimed is painted in a different light to suit the manager&rsquo;s stature in the organization.  Reacting frantically to what was asked of the investigation team without considering the potential impact to the investigation is a rookie move &ndash; not to mention that fudged findings can put you on litigious ground unnecessarily.</p><p> Calmer heads in Employee Relations will always prevail. </p><p> Managing risk and conducting investigations requires a certain temperament. You need to be able to ask the right questions that will lead you to the answers you seek. We also need to welcome collegial discourse that allows one party to respectfully question a practice that doesn&rsquo;t seem right without being seen as a troublemaker.</p><p> In my experience, the power of managing risk from an employee relations standpoint is in the concerted efforts among all of the team members that touch the process.</p><p> If you are in charge of an HR department, please be sure you are putting the right people in ER positions and not just anyone who thinks they can do the job. Please and thank you!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-25 17:51:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-25 17:51:54.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_lnqB58a.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/risky-business-why-calmer-thinking-prevails-in-employee-relations/\", \"post_id\": \"11342\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-25 17:51:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-25 17:51:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"risky-business-why-calmer-thinking-prevails-in-employee-relations\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11341\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5541\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Risky-Business-Why-Calmer-Thinking-Prevails-in-Employee-Relations.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1335\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464271200,"author_id":212,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5321,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Should We Use Robo-Advisors? I Don't Know, Let's Ask Siri!","link":"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Any web search for &ldquo;robo-advisors&rdquo; (or robo-advisers, robo-planners, etc.) produces an interesting spectrum of content, from &ldquo;for&rdquo; to &ldquo;against,&rdquo; with a fair share of &ldquo;undecided.&rdquo;</h3>Some posts are ready to embrace new technology. We recently re-blogged <a href=\"/development/how-robo-advice-has-upped-everyones-game\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Robo Advice? Bring it on, it will be great for business</a> by Tony Vidler. He says robo-advisors:Will be good for business for those advisors who provide real value and are smart marketers. The Robo&rsquo;s will probably kill off the bottom-feeders in the business, together with those who have no genuine advice-based value proposition. Perhaps that is an unfortunate consequence, but then, maybe it isn&rsquo;t.We also reblogged Neil Wood&rsquo;s post &ldquo;<a href=\"/grow/development/are-you-prepared-for-the-tidal-wave-of-assets-going-into-robo-advisor-programs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Are You Prepared For the Tidal Wave Of Assets Going Into Robo-Advisor Programs?</a>&rdquo; He says:Remember the stock jockeys of the 1970s-1990s that refused to embrace financial planning? Many call them dinosaurs that died with a change in the way our industry did business. There will always be new competitors in our industry. People want faster, cheaper, better, improved, more powerful and a so-called better mousetrap.But many posts are threatened by new technology. For example, the title alone in the post by Sara Grillo puts robo-advisors in a derogated status: <a href=\"/sell/marketing/why-a-roboadvisor-is-like-getting-financial-advice-at-a-mcdonalds-drive-through\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Why a Robo-advisor is Like Getting Financial Advice at a McDonald&rsquo;s Drive Through</a>. More on Ms. Grillo in a minute &hellip;.Here is another, where the title of the article by Craig Iskowitz sounds as if he thinks robo-advisors are a passing fad: <a href=\"https://ezragroupllc.com/2016/02/26/dead-robo-walking-wealthfront-doomed/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Dead Robo Walking: Why Wealthfront is Doomed</a>.However, he provides real analysis of the new technology and differentiates the growing field of robo-advisors, calling out Wealthfront as an advisor he believes failed to prepare and execute well. Wealthfront may not do well, but Mr. Iskowitz sees it as losing out to other investment firms, both robo or traditional.Finally, there are some who purport to be threatened but may in fact be carving out their own turf in the robo-advisor space. Ron Lieber believes that is what JP Morgan is doing.As I said in <a href=\"http://www.millennials-money.com/index.php/2016/03/25/what-is-a-financial-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> What is a financial plan?</a>, that those who insist that robo-advisors will not replace individual, human planners comprise the &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no app for that&rdquo; group.Hold on, Steven. This is Siri. What about me? Where do I fit in?Well Siri, you are a robo-voice, not an advisor.But you ask me questions all the time!Yes, I do. But I don&rsquo;t count on you for life-changing decisions!I&rsquo;m hurt!Enough! As promised, back to Sara Grillo. In the end, she thinks robo-advisors &ldquo;are a good way to get financial advice for those who have no emotion attached to their money, a long time horizon, and simple requirements.&rdquo; However, if you need more attention, then she expects you to pay a human for advice, despite the $500,000 portfolio minimum threshold barrier.Should that be the cutoff? You have to already be wealthy to get good advice? We think it shouldn&rsquo;t.Imagine that, as a financial planner, CFP or other advisor, robo-advisor technology frees up more of your time. You could use that time to provide more advice to clients or to advise more clients.

I have also learned that they lend significant guidance to better understanding your relationship with money and wealth. </p><p> As a society, given where we have been and where we are now relative to global economics, finances, and interpersonal relationships, there are two archetypes (sometimes considered to be one) that come to mind&ndash;enter Midas and Miser. </p><p> Most I believe are familiar with the story of King Midas&ndash;everything he touched turned to gold, including his beloved daughter. On the one hand, the Midas archetype is connected with entrepreneurial and creative abilities. The gift of taking an idea and seeing it through to physical manifestation and great success. Steve Jobs is one example. On the other hand, there is the shadow side of Midas. As a King, Midas&rsquo; position is symbolically connected to the power to create wealth for an entire kingdom however, his focus was only of personal amassment and glorification. Greed was his motivation, and ultimately his downfall. From this we can surmise that lessons of generosity and benevolence are characteristics of this archetype. What you do for oneself, you do for others and the effects are felt by the whole. </p><p> The Miser acquires his/her wealth by hoarding money (and/or emotions, time, creativity, talents, etc), refusing to share. This time greed plays itself out from a place of lack, scarcity. The Miser also tends to exist &ldquo;outside&rdquo; himself/herself, seeking to manage his/her fears by controlling others or circumstances. The lesson here again is in transforming greed to generosity. To give without the fear of losing it all. </p><p> Greed has eradicated past human civilizations&hellip;and we, as a global society, are once again at grave risk of repeating past patterns. We&rsquo;ve been given the signs, recalling the events of 2001-2002 and 2008-2010. We live in a &ldquo;dog eat dog&rdquo; world and a world afraid of sharing wealth. It is time to begin shifting the belief that greed will bring about abundance and compassion. The time is now, starting with each individual, to ask yourself at what length are you willing to go to create piles of money&mdash;and the consequences your actions will have on the greater whole, your family, your community, and society. Will your actions come from a place of fear, greed, and competition or from a place of faith and benevolence?</p><p> Imagine a world open to sharing wealth, creativity, prosperity, and well-being&hellip;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 15:20:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 15:20:36.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_8N99ssK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/king-midas-and-miser-business-lessons-we-can-learn-from-energy-guides-to-hit-potential/\", \"post_id\": \"11346\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 15:20:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 15:20:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"king-midas-and-miser-business-lessons-we-can-learn-from-energy-guides-to-hit-potential\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11345\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5543\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/King-Midas-and-Miser-Business-Lessons-We-Can-Learn-From-Energy-Guides-to-Hit-Potential.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1728\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464372000,"author_id":113,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5323,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Essential Elements of Grit Instilled During My Time as an FBI Agent","link":"4-essential-elements-of-grit-instilled-during-my-time-as-an-fbi-agent","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It didn&rsquo;t take me long to figure out what I needed to do to move as quickly as possible out of the rut of Team B and into the ranks of Team A&mdash;comprised of FBI agents who not only worked hard but had the grit to keep moving ahead when faced with failure or adversity.</p><p> But new agents were not the only ones stuck on Team B.</p><p> Older agents who did not have the grit to consistently do what they needed to do to succeed often found themselves run over by other agents who possessed resolve, willpower, and the perseverance to stick to their long-term goals.</p><p> Grit is your ability to persevere over the long-run and thrive despite all kinds of unplanned events.</p><p> As leaders, entrepreneurs and business owners, grit is an essential skill because it is the one thing you will need to succeed. If you give up when the going gets tough, you&rsquo;re done.</p><p> Here are 4 essential elements of grit that you should know:</p><h3> 1. Feel The Fire In Your Belly</h3><p> <br/> I knew I wanted to be the type of FBI Agent who could make a difference. In other words, I was passionate about my work.</p><p> Passion is the linchpin of grit. It is doing something and following a dream that gives you both value and meaning.</p><p> Passion gives people a single-mindedness that we do not see in others. It is a combination of ambition, willpower, and grit that keeps long-term goals in focus at all times.</p><p> TIP:</p><li> When you feel your determination begin to waver, remember the reason you want to accomplish your goal.</li><li> If you surrender and give up, ask yourself if it&rsquo;s because there is no fire in your belly and you are not really following your dream. <br/>  </li><p> All dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity; but the dreamers of the day are dangerous, for they may act their dream with open eyes to make it possible&mdash;T.E. Lawrence</p><h3> 2. Maintain Clarity of Goals</h3><p> <br/> When I first started working counterintelligence and espionage, my goal was to be assigned a foreign intelligence officer.</p><p> Later, though, my goal had shifted. Now it wasn&rsquo;t enough to be working cases&mdash;I felt drawn to tell others about how a huge organization like the FBI could be nimble and flexible enough to react to the demands of terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11.</p><p> My vision had not changed&mdash;I still wanted to be an FBI agent, but my goal had. I became the spokesperson for the FBI in Northern California for four years. I&rsquo;m glad I made the move because my long-term goals had shifted.</p><p> TIP:</p><li> Revisit your goals annually to make certain that something hasn&rsquo;t changed over the past year. Your mind is constantly adapting to new information coming your way.</li><li> Even a slight shift calls for a re-alignment in your priorities. Like myself, it may not require you to throw up your hands and quit, but it may suggest that you re-think where you fit in the larger picture. <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Follow Up With Self-Discipline</h3><p> <br/> There were many times when it was tempting to give up on an investigation when the leads got cold and there was no easy path forward.</p><p> Mental toughness was required to persevere and be agile enough in my thinking that I could approach a roadblock or obstacle from many different angles&mdash;always looking for the soft underbelly and refusing to give up.</p><p> Self-discipline is important because while grit is the ability to keep doing something, self-discipline often implies the ability to refrain from doing something.</p><p> TIP:</p><li> Face your problems head on. It isn&rsquo;t your problems that define you&mdash;it&rsquo;s how you react and recover from them. Your problems are not going away unless you do something about them.</li><li> Be honest with yourself about what you want to achieve, who you want to become, and the obstacles that are preventing you from achieving your goals.</li><li> Define your goal as behavior. Identify the specific steps you need to take to achieve your goal. Define your goal in terms of behavior.</li><li> Organize your day. Once you&rsquo;ve set your goal, it must become a priority.</li><li> Watch for excuses. Self-discipline means doing something you don&rsquo;t necessary want to do.</li><li> Remember the reasons you want to reach your goal. When you feel your determination begin to waver, remember the reason you want to accomplish your goal. <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Learn From Your Misses</h3><p> <br/> Training in the FBI starts on your first day at the FBI Academy in Quantico and ends on your last day as an agent. If FBI instructors are not pushing you beyond your comfort zone, they aren&rsquo;t doing their job.</p><p> Moving out of our comfort zone is hard because it usually means a trial and error approach as we find new footing. It&rsquo;s important to take mistakes in stride and use the opportunity to learn from them. Only idiots don&rsquo;t learn from their mistakes.</p><p> People with grit shrug off failure, focus on immediate recovery, and move on. The attitude determines the outcome, so it&rsquo;s important to focus on lessons learned and how to keep moving forward.</p><p> TIP:</p><li> Seek feedback about how you can make your best performance even better. Research indicates that leaders who are in the top 10% are those who are willing to ask for feedback&mdash;both positive and negative.</li><li> Celebrate the small wins. Learn to appreciate the smaller steps that lead to success.</li><li> Learn from your challenges and become better because of them. <br/>  </li><p> Grit is the mental toughness to continue to move ahead even when life hasn&rsquo;t thrown you a perfect hand. It is the deliberate action of doing something again and again until you get it right. And then maybe doing it again after that, too.</p><p> Talent does not trump determination. Nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Grit, persistence, and determination will keep you moving ahead when your circumstances and environment has changed.</p><p> How have you developed grit?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 15:39:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 15:39:05.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_M3rwrT1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-essential-elements-of-grit-instilled-during-my-time-as-an-fbi-agent/\", \"post_id\": \"11348\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 15:39:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 15:39:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-essential-elements-of-grit-instilled-during-my-time-as-an-fbi-agent\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11347\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5544\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4-Essential-Elements-of-Grit-Instilled-During-My-Time-as-an-FBI-Agent.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"863\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464501600,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

This is a typical entrepreneurial day.</p><p> When I get down, I pick up the phone to speak with a good friend who understands similar situations.

Don't use to-do lists</h3><p> <br/> Did you know 41% of tasks on to-do lists never get done?</p><p> When we leave a task unfinished, our subconscious is negatively impacted (aka the Zeigarnik Effect). It leads to worry-filled, restless nights as our brains try to process all that didn&rsquo;t get accomplished during the day.</p><p> Kevin&rsquo;s suggestion is to stop living from unfinished and stressful to-do lists and start organizing your world from your calendar.</p><p> Rather than a slew of tasks on paper, which have no context as to complexity or time requirements, set aside time blocks on your calendar to complete those tasks.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll kill two birds with one stone&ndash;you&rsquo;re less likely to procrastinate a big task if the time is already secured (i.e. no meetings or phone calls scheduled during that time) and you&rsquo;ll reduce your mental stress as you don&rsquo;t have to think about what hasn&rsquo;t gotten done.</p><p> Tools, such as  <a href=\"https://calendly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Calendly </a>  and even good old Outlook, exist to help you manage your personal and professional time; effectively allowing you to align your tasks and schedule to your values and priorities.</p><h3> 2. Limit meetings</h3><p> <br/> Can you imagine Bill Gates bopping in and out of meetings all week?  Of course not!  His time, just like yours, is extremely valuable and 99% of the time is better spent doing his actual job.</p><p> In fact, nearly every one of the ultra-productive leaders Kevin surveyed said they have strict rules in place to how often they would schedule and attend meetings.</p><p> Some set aside one day a week where they won&rsquo;t schedule any meetings to not interrupt the flow of productivity, while others swing to the other extreme and allow just one a day a week for planned meetings.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/time-wasting-at-work-infographic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Atlassian </a>  even suggests that as much as $37 billion in salary costs is wasted in the U.S. alone due to employees attending unnecessary meetings. It&rsquo;s not only a productivity killer, it&rsquo;s a profitability drainer, too.</p><h3> 3. Make your mornings count</h3><p> <br/> Consistent morning routines which include drinking water, eating breakfast, and some form of exercise, are another common habit of ultra-productive people.</p><p> Meeting your body&rsquo;s basic physical needs, combined with some form of mental preparation such as reading or meditating, is a proven way to set yourself up for an energized and productive day.</p><p> &ldquo;If you want to do more, you need to become more,&rdquo; says Kevin on why you can&rsquo;t forego your morning routines.</p><p> Block out an hour on your calendar every morning for your &ldquo;pre-work prep.&rdquo;  It doesn&rsquo;t have to be CrossFit or a gourmet breakfast, but whatever it is, it needs to be consistent.</p><p> It can be as simple as drinking a protein shake and 20 minutes on a treadmill while watching the news&ndash;these few tasks awaken your mind and body, and set the tone for the rest of your day.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Kevin dropped this nugget of wisdom, saying, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not attacking the day, you&rsquo;re letting the day attack you!&rdquo;</p><p> Take control of your time and productivity through a series of intentional actions.</p><p> Swap your to-do list for a calendar.  Be ruthless about which meetings are critical and which should be scrapped.  Start your day by invigorating your mind and body, so you can achieve productivity like you&rsquo;ve never known.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 16:17:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 16:17:37.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_WoXN3gc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-should-stop-using-to-do-lists/\", \"post_id\": \"11352\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 16:17:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 16:17:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-should-stop-using-to-do-lists\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11351\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5546\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-You-Should-Stop-Using-To-Do-Lists.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"528\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464368400,"author_id":208,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5326,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Own Your Own Firm (or Looking to Start One)? How to Recognize Intangibles of Success","link":"own-your-own-firm-or-looking-to-start-one-how-to-recognize-intangibles-of-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In January, I offered strategies on entrepreneurship in &ldquo;Five Reasons to Start Your Own Firm and Four Steps to Take to Do It.&rdquo; Now, I would like to address the intangibles of an entrepreneurial mindset.</p><p> Launching a business and then building a profitable company are difficult. Even in the business-friendly climate in the United States, the overwhelming majority of new businesses fail.</p><h3> Recognize the Intangibles of Success &mdash; Especially Trust</h3><p> <br/> There is so much in life we cannot measure. How do you quantify trust, love, relationships, and communication? Our interdependent global economy naturally puts a premium on trust, which cannot be measured.</p><p> Acquiring and serving clients requires specific skills. When launching your own business, you will need to foster trust with prospective clients and strategic referral partners. In order to help clients implement investment or financial planning advice, you will need to build even more trust.</p><p> On the recommendation of my business partner, I read The Speed of Trust by Stephen M. R. Covey. It taught me the importance of using my ears and mouth proportionately. To build trust, take a &ldquo;listen first&rdquo; attitude. Genuine listening is an intangible skill and a competitive advantage. Covey also explains that trust is a function of two things: character and competence.</p><p> Character is defined by your integrity, your motives, and your intentions. Competence is a function of your capabilities, your skills, your results, and your track record. Both are equally critical when fostering trust and relationships that will support the growth of your investment business.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"572\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Intangible-Capital-Chart.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><h3> Measure Success</h3><p> It is important to have metrics for quantifying success. Just as benchmarks are important for measuring the success of an investment portfolio, they are also critical for your business success, because you are responsible for your time. <br/>   <br/> Though assets under management and returns are both important for profitability, how well you define success at the beginning of your business will determine how strong a foundation you have for progress in growth. Our firm made a decision to never allow the size of our company or number of clients to define our success. We choose to measure success in terms of helping clients achieve their goals through financial planning and the impact we have on the world through our education strategy. Our Blue Ocean Strategy is education.</p><h3> Adopt a Global Mindset</h3><p> <br/> One of my favorite childhood activities was buying the Choco Taco from the local Good Humor ice cream truck. Unilever, a British-Dutch company and the world&rsquo;s largest ice-cream maker, owns Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s, Breyers, and Good Humor. CITGO was founded by Henry Doherty, an American, in 1910, but the company is now owned by the government of Venezuela. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council owns 75% of New York City&rsquo;s Chrysler Building, while Israeli El-Ad Group owns the Plaza Hotel.</p><p> The interdependence of our global supply chain requires us to have a global mindset across all disciplines. Just under half of S&amp;P 500 sales are from outside the United States. If the Ford you buy is built in Mexico and the Honda is manufactured in Ohio, which company has a better claim to ask its customers to &ldquo;Buy American&rdquo;?</p><p> Similarly, clients require their advisers to have a global perspective when serving as fiduciaries and managing their investment portfolios. Investment professionals must account for and explain myriad variables, including increased global stock market correlations, each country&rsquo;s idiosyncratic stage of the investment cycle, low-interest rates in many developed market economies, and geopolitical uncertainty.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Estimated-Percent-of-S-and-P-500-Company-Sales.png\" width=\"584\"/></p><h3> Embrace Innovation</h3><p> <br/> Taking an innovative approach when building your investment business will help you drive progress and expand your opportunity set. This may mean that you are thoughtful about how you engage your clients and prospects, perhaps leveraging technology to communicate through video conferencing rather than requesting a traditional meeting at your office.</p><p> Innovation can also occur within your investment process when you identify non-traditional asset classes or discover new ways to hedge against adverse declines in portfolio value.</p><p> We follow a financial planning process at our firm. Investments are important and represent a cornerstone of each financial planning relationship. When planning for the launch of our firm, our team recognized that technology must be an asset rather than a challenge, barrier, or constraint.</p><p> As a result, we conducted an exhaustive global search to identify experienced technology partners. We became clients of several companies and referred others in our network to test our new resources. We applied our financial planning background to create a technology planning process to help align marketing, sales, and technology resource allocations with the organization&rsquo;s strategic plan. Sustaining a company&rsquo;s inherent competitive advantages requires a transparent and innovative technology partner.</p><h3> Have a Long-Term Perspective</h3><p> <br/> Investing for clients requires a long-term perspective. So does launching a business and building an enduring company. They are often a life&rsquo;s work. I tried to make this point when I spent time in India this past fall providing entrepreneurial education and speaking on the benefits of completing the CFA Program.</p><p> Today, India is experiencing a start-up revolution. The country is young, with over 500 million people under the age of 26. Naturally, the media focuses on the success stories of a few companies such as SnapDeal and FlipKart. I reminded the audience these are anomalies, though. Even these seeming overnight successes are the product of much more than a great idea and an infusion of capital. A long-term perspective is fundamental to building a great business. It is essential to make decisions based upon where you want to be five, 10, and 20 years from now.</p><h3> Enjoy the Journey</h3><p> <br/> Satisfaction is found in personal and professional happiness. Work fueled by your strengths and passions will produce extraordinary results.</p><p> This story, which is probably apocryphal, sheds some light on what I mean:</p><p> When John Lennon was a boy in the late 1940s, his mother taught him the importance of happiness. One day in school, the teacher instructed the class to draw what they wanted to be when they grew up on a piece of paper.</p><p> Most students created pictures of Winston Churchill, pilots, firefighters, and those heroes who had led the United Kingdom in World War II. John drew happy faces, toys, and the beach. John&rsquo;s teacher said, &ldquo;John, you don&rsquo;t understand the assignment.&rdquo; John replied to his teacher, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand life.&rdquo;</p><p> I encourage you to think about what makes you happy. Follow your heart when applying for your next job or launching your next entrepreneurial venture.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 16:33:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 16:33:28.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_CkoqWLG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/own-your-own-firm-or-looking-to-start-one-how-to-recognize-intangibles-of-success/\", \"post_id\": \"11356\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 16:33:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 16:33:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"own-your-own-firm-or-looking-to-start-one-how-to-recognize-intangibles-of-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11353\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5547\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Own-Your-Own-Firm-or-Looking-to-Start-One-How-to-Recognize-Intangibles-of-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"963\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464422400,"author_id":421,"chart_url":""}

In reality, retirement is little more than a career change.</h3><p> <br/> It is rare for a person to move from a job with a regular paycheck into a stay-at-home life with little more to do than sit on the couch and watch television. You may not be moving into another full time job or even part-time work, but for most retirees happiness comes with finding useful ways to fill the void after leaving the nine to five grind.</p><p> According to clinical psychologist Jill Steinberg it&rsquo;s the people who don&rsquo;t think about what they are going to do in retirement before they leave their job who have the most trouble making the transition. But there are steps you can take after you leave full time work to develop your life&rsquo;s &ldquo;second act.&rdquo;</p><p> In an article for Everyday Health, Katherine Lee offered tips she says will help you create a new life that is as happy and stimulating as you want it to be.</p><h3> 1. Take your time</h3><p> <br/> This might surprise you. Life is a transition and it doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. So after you leave your job take the time to relax, travel, or to do something you have wanted to do. In doing so you have some all-important &ldquo;me time&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll also have time for ideas to percolate in your brain.</p><h3> 2. Define retirement</h3><p> <br/> Retirement&rsquo;s different for everyone but you probably have some ideas about how you would like to spend retirement. Write them down. List the ones you believe are most important for you first. Be specific. Don&rsquo;t just write down &ldquo;travel.&rdquo; For example, write, &ldquo;Take a gondola ride in Venice.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. Take an honest look at your financial situation.</h3><p> <br/> Most people discover they need to supplement social security and savings with at least some part-time employment. That is not a sign of failure. More than anything else it&rsquo;s a sign of the times, so you&rsquo;re probably not alone.</p><h3> 4. Keep moving and stay active</h3><p> <br/> Make time for regular exercise. Not only is it good for your body, it helps your mind stay sharp as well.</p><h3> 5. Maintain an active social network</h3><p> <br/> This should be an important part of your retirement plan. Consider the social network you have now and how you would like to build it. This is a network of friends who can to you with the overall enjoyment of life.</p><h3> 6. Keep your skills current</h3><p> <br/> Remember your skills are a selling point that can separate you from the pack and could open doors for you. Don&rsquo;t shy away from classes that could strengthen the skills you already have and lead to certifications that may make you more attractive to potential employers.</p><h3> 7. Be flexible</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s important to have a plan but we all know plans don&rsquo;t always work out. Wanting a second act in the workforce is good, but when your first choice for a second career evaporates take a good look at your transferable skills that could be keys to opening other doors of opportunity.</p><h3> 8. Finally, a successful transition to retirement isn&rsquo;t always easy</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t resist the idea to seek help from a retirement specialist for professional advice and guidance in making the transition.</p><p> It&rsquo;s been said &ldquo;unretirement&rdquo; is the new retirement. The fact is few have the financial reserves to live a retirement life without at least part time work.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 16:42:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 16:42:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_UqK9ZFV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-steps-to-transition-into-retirement-just-like-a-career-change/\", \"post_id\": \"11358\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 16:42:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 16:42:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-steps-to-transition-into-retirement-just-like-a-career-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11357\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5548\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/8-Steps-to-Transition-Into-Retirement-Just-Like-a-Career-Change.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"873\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464361200,"author_id":464,"chart_url":""}

It goes something like this, according to Wikipedia</p><p> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys, and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes, the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, \"This is where the light is.\"</p><p> This parable describes the phenomenon known as The Streetlight Effect. It is defined as a type of observational bias where people only look for whatever they are searching for by looking where it is easiest. The search itself may be referred to as a drunkard's search.</p><p> It got me thinking about how companies decide to make improvements to the customer experience. Assuming they do anything at all, it often happens just like that: they go to where the light is. In other words, they pick the low-hanging fruit. And sometimes, when you're picking the low-hanging fruit, you get stuck in this loop or cycle of finding other low-hanging fruit - and feeling like you're making some progress, but you're really not.</p><p> Bottom line is that it's a waste of time and resources to just do what's easy to do.</p><p> \"Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy are the noise before defeat.\" - Sun Tzu</p><h3> Company's suffering from the Streetlight Effect:</h3><li> improve only the stuff that's easy and accessible to fix</li><li> apply band-aids rather than work to get to the root cause, to fix the systemic issue</li><li> often delay doing the hard work</li><li> have disparate and siloed improvement efforts happening throughout the company</li><li> don't make improvements based on work they've done to identify what's important to the customer</li><li>  don't identify what's important to the customer</li><li> don't make improvements based on the impact of the fix, i.e., on the customer and then on the business</li><li> don't think about outcomes </li><li> only focus on time to fix and cost to fix</li><li> think touchpoints, not journeys - don't think about the experience holistically</li><li> are very tactical, not strategic, in their efforts</li><li> aren't able to transform the organization, culture, experience</li><li> either lack or haven't communicated well a customer experience vision</li><li> haven't defined and communicated a customer experience strategy <br/>  </li><p> The best way to keep employees or individual departments or business units from conducting a drunkard's search is to create, communicate, and live and breathe your...</p><li> brand promise</li><li> guiding principles</li><li> organization's mission</li><li> customer experience vision <br/>  </li><p> ... and outline and communicate the customer experience strategy, which helps to define, design, and, ultimately, deliver the desired customer experience (desired, of course, by your customers). The strategy is mainly about the how, but your customer experience strategy may also include details about the who, what, when, and the how much of experience design and helps everyone focus on those activities or improvements that will be most impactful to your customers. (It gets everyone on the same page, marching to the same beat.)</p><p> Working in the light of the street, focusing on the easy stuff, derails you from the hard work that is required by your customer experience strategy. Don't get me wrong: sometimes doing that solves an immediate problem. But while it's tempting to only focus there, stick with the strategy outlined to achieve your goals.

{"original_id":5330,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Detailed Onboarding System for First-Time Employees","link":"a-detailed-onboarding-system-for-first-time-employees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Every manager wants to hire great employees. However, the process of building a great team doesn't end with just finding the right people. In order to set teams up for success, supervisors and managers need to construct a detailed onboarding system that ensures new hires are educated on how to excel in their roles.</p><p> For no group is this more important than first-time employees &mdash; or recent college graduates with limited professional experience. Most of them will find everything about their new work environment different, so it&rsquo;s important to create a program that factors in adjusting to the workplace alongside learning the skills of the trade. </p><p> Does the thought of teaching a whole new generation of workers how to be effective sound daunting? Don&rsquo;t worry. They have almost all of the tools they need to succeed (you hired them in the first place for a reason!), and we&rsquo;re here to help identify what they&rsquo;re lacking, what they need, and how you can set them up for success.</p><h3> What Recent College Grads Are Lacking</h3><p> <br/> Two words: soft skills. It turns out that despite being new to their roles, it&rsquo;s not technical know-how that recent college grads are missing. In a survey done by Adecco Staffing USA, it was found that 44% of senior executives believed that the biggest gap in skills had to do with the following:</p><li> Communication</li><li> Critical thinking</li><li> Creativity</li><li> Collaboration</li><p> The distinction between technical and soft skills is important here, because a lot of these traits are developed over time and on the job. However, that&rsquo;s exactly what recent grads are missing &mdash; time on the job. This study by McKinsey &amp; Company further expounds on the point, by citing that while 72% of educational institutions believe recent grads are prepared to take on the workplace, only 42% of employers concur with that assessment.</p><h3> How Do Soft Skills Translate to the Work Environment?</h3><p> <br/> While the above-listed soft skills are easy enough to comprehend on a word-association level, what do they actually mean in terms of the workplace?</p><li> Communication: The ability to clearly communicate ideas, and keep one&rsquo;s supervisor and teammates informed, as well as the ability to ask questions and seek clarification when objectives or procedures are not perfectly clear.</li><li> Critical thinking: The ability to problem solve and find solutions in the face of doubt or when guidance is not available.</li><li> Creativity: Being open to new ideas and seeing problems from different sides. Bringing new solutions to the table or being able to adapt to changing demands.</li><li> Collaboration: Knowing how to work in a team. Making sure to pull one&rsquo;s own weight as well as communicate effectively with all members of a team in order to produce the desired outcome. <br/>  </li><p> What&rsquo;s great about recent grads missing soft skills, as opposed to technical, is that soft skills can be naturally picked up on the job. Just working on a team forces members to adapt in order to succeed. The downside is that teams absolutely require them in order to succeed. Having someone throw a wrench in the works because they&rsquo;re unable to communicate clearly with other members can have a big impact on business and office morale. Therein lies the dilemma, but what&rsquo;s to be done?</p><h3> What They Need to Succeed</h3><p> <br/> Training. Pure and simple. While it would be ideal for candidates to arrive straight out of the gate as impact makers, the truth is that first-time employees aren't always going to come fully assembled. But that's OK &mdash; as long as you hired them because you&rsquo;re invested in the individual, rather than the position.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve taken a chance on a recent grad, it&rsquo;s likely because you saw them for their potential. With the right employee onboarding program in place, you can help grow that potential and mold these folks into the perfect contributors to your organization.</p><p> Another way to help these new hires adapt is by providing a mentor. This survey conducted by Atenga shows that 67% of millennials believe that strong mentors are important to their success with a company.  And many Fortune 500 organizations have built mentorships into their onboarding processes.</p><p> Even for the ones who seem to have things figured out, the right employee onboarding process is an essential part of the new hire experience. Why? It helps solidify their role in your company. Imagine weight lifting, for instance. You wouldn&rsquo;t start by picking up the heaviest dumbbells in the room and trying to curl them, because you&rsquo;d risk injuring yourself. The same applies to onboarding. Not giving new hires the chance to familiarize themselves with the various processes of your organization risks alienating them, lowering morale, and can ultimately lead to the high cost of turnover.</p><h3> The 30-, 60-, 90-Day Onboarding Plan</h3><p> <br/> Instead, there are many ways to help get first-time hires ready for their new role. One of the best techniques we can think of is the 30-, 60-, 90-day plan. While traditionally it&rsquo;s used as a means for new hires to evaluate their own progress with a company, there&rsquo;s absolutely no reason you can&rsquo;t adapt it and make it work as part of your company&rsquo;s onboarding process.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how to structure the three different stages:</p><p> <strong>  The First 30 Days </strong></p><p> This is the learning stage of the process, where new hires look about the company and its culture, as well as navigate the professional landscape by determining one&rsquo;s expectations and interacting with coworkers.</p><p> <strong>  From Day 30 to Day 60 </strong></p><p> This is where more assertion takes place. It&rsquo;s where the new hire should be discovering how they fit into the context of the company and bringing their own unique ideas to the table. They should be discovering how they can make an impact and should be taking on new opportunities.</p><p> <strong>  From Day 60 to Day 90 </strong></p><p> The final stage is full assimilation &mdash; the transformation, so to speak. The employee should now be able to identify problems, bring their own solutions to the table, and work with others in order to make things happen. They should be able to identify new opportunities and take them on accordingly, well aware of how procedures work, and able to make high-level impacts from their role.</p><p> As you can see, the 30-, 60-, 90-day plan helps to address all of the soft-skill functions that employers have found recent grads to be lacking while at the same time ensuring that new hires gain a complete understanding of the company and their position in it. By partnering this with a mentorship program and providing them with check-ins to see how they&rsquo;re coming along, you&rsquo;ll be able to put even the most inexperienced new hires on the path for success. Which is good for you, good for them, and great for the company.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 17:16:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 17:16:47.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_WNClYmc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-detailed-onboarding-system-for-first-time-employees/\", \"post_id\": \"11370\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 17:16:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 17:16:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-detailed-onboarding-system-for-first-time-employees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11369\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5551\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/A-Detailed-Onboarding-System-for-First-Time-Employees.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"428\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464364800,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

How to Create an Action Plan to Achieve Your Goal","link":"failed-in-the-past-how-to-create-an-action-plan-to-achieve-your-goal","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Change sucks. Whether you&rsquo;re trying to build in more balance, boost your business, or stop binging on brownies, we can always find reasons NOT to take action. In my work with clients (especially women), I find that activities relating to self-care and prioritizing one&rsquo;s own needs are often the most challenging. For most, we&rsquo;ve been conditioned to put others&rsquo; needs ahead of our own. Carving out time for ourselves can feel scary or like we&rsquo;re a selfish slacker.</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to find a million reasons not to take care of ourselves. Our excuses often outweigh our motivation to create change. So today, I&rsquo;m going to walk you through a common self-care goal and show you the exact system I use to create any type of lifestyle change. This system not only addresses the obstacles that held you back, it also helps you to create a motivating plan for change. So, let&rsquo;s get to it.</p><h3> Goal: Meditate For A Minimum Of 5 Minutes Each Day <br/>  </h3><h3> Step 1. Get clear on the benefits of your goal and what you&rsquo;ll achieve <br/>  </h3><p> This step is all about your &ldquo;What &amp; Why.&rdquo; In other words, why is this change important to you? What do you want to achieve and what will that feel like? It&rsquo;s not enough to focus on the textbook benefits, you need to go deeper and find what it means to you. For example, meditation has A TON of well-documented benefits including:</p><li> less stress</li><li> better sleep</li><li> improved physical &amp; mental health</li><li> more energy</li><li> better memory</li><p> But that&rsquo;s not going to get you to meditate. Why? Because it doesn&rsquo;t create a clear visual of what you&rsquo;ll achieve and how you&rsquo;ll feel. Take it one step further and tap into what you&rsquo;ll use those benefits for. For example, &ldquo;Adding in 5 minutes of mediation each day will help me to (decrease my stress which will help me to) not flip out when my boss asks for a project update.&rdquo;</p><h3> Step 2. Address your personal obstacles <br/>  </h3><p> These are the internal reasons that held you back in the past.</p><li> I stopped meditating because it&rsquo;s frustrating. I couldn&rsquo;t get my mind to stop wandering, so I gave up.</li><li> I don&rsquo;t like being still. Feeling my feelings makes me want to reach for my phone and distract myself.</li><p> Writing out what previously held you back will stop the amorphous, unnamed fears from sabotaging you. And, it will help you to create a plan that addresses these challenges moving forward.</p><h3> Step 3. Block out time to take action <br/>  </h3><p> This step is crucial. It isn&rsquo;t enough to focus on the internal obstacles that keep you stuck, you need to focus on the external. Why? Because we tend to procrastinate the things that are new and uncomfortable. We wait until we magically &ldquo;find time,&rdquo; rather than actively making time.</p><p> When a client tells me &ldquo;I want to meditate, but I&rsquo;m too busy,&rdquo; I know their time management skills don&rsquo;t support the life they want to create. The key to making a habit stick is to determine when and where it will happen in your routine. For example, if you&rsquo;re committing to adding 5 minutes of meditation in the morning, visualize how it fits in with your current routine: &ldquo;Every morning I brush my teeth, wash my face, meditate for 5 minutes, eat breakfast, etc.&rdquo;</p><h3> Step 4. Create your action plan <br/>  </h3><p> To do this, draw on step #1 to get clear on your EXACT goal and why it matters to you. Look at the obstacles from step #2 and figure out how you&rsquo;ll respond to each. Block out time and space (using your calendar or alarms as necessary) to incorporate it into your current routine. Go into as much detail as possible to ensure that when the time comes to take action, you aren&rsquo;t scratching your head.</p><h3> Step 5. Track Your Accomplishments. <br/>  </h3><p> Whether it&rsquo;s creating a chart or using an app, celebrate each win. Be sure to acknowledge your progress and how far you&rsquo;ve come!</p><h3> To Review:</h3><li> List the benefits, how you&rsquo;ll feel, and what you&rsquo;ll achieve.</li><li> Get clear on the personal obstacles that previously held you back</li><li> Mange your time</li><li> Create a detailed action plan</li><li> Track and celebrate your success</li><h3> The Takeaway: <br/>  </h3><p> To achieve new goals, you must be willing to try new things. Rather than using the same methods you used before and then beating yourself up for getting the same results, create a plan that draws on what didn&rsquo;t work to propel you forward. Remember: how we do anything is how we do everything. Use these steps to troubleshoot the changes you struggle to make. And if you need support, I&rsquo;ve got these 3 options for you.

{"original_id":5332,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"12-Step Quick and Dirty Content Strategy Guide","link":"12-step-quick-and-dirty-content-strategy-guide","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Having a documented content marketing strategy is one of the primary indicators of whether or not you will be successful in your content marketing efforts.</h3><p> <br/> Whether you have an abundance of content and you&rsquo;re overwhelmed at the thought of organizing it all or your content library is pretty lean &ndash; this quick and dirty content strategy guide will help you think strategically about your next marketing move.</p><p> Whether you have an abundance of content and you&rsquo;re overwhelmed at the thought of organizing it all or your content library is pretty lean &ndash; this quick and dirty content strategy guide will help you think strategically about your next marketing move.</p><p> Below are the recommended steps you should take to build out a documented content marketing strategy for your business. It&rsquo;s only when you are able to be clear in these areas that you can truly organize your marketing efforts to support your bottom line.</p><h3> Step 1: Document your business goals</h3><p> <br/> What are three to five business goals you hope to achieve this year? Is it reaching a certain level of sales, successfully entering a new market, launching a new service or product? Whatever it is for you, get it down in writing as the first place you start when you think of marketing.</p><h3> Step 2: Write your brand short story</h3><p> <br/> What&rsquo;s your brand about and why does it matter? Can you communicate in 30 seconds or less why your brand exists and why your audience should care? For planning purposes, don&rsquo;t pen a Tolstoy novel. Seriously, no one has time for all that. Document the essence of your brand &ndash; the must-know climax of your story. Clear and concise in an ever impatient, interrupted World will only help you in the long run.</p><h3> Step 3: Craft a content marketing mission statement</h3><p> <br/> What is the purpose of your content and for whom is it being created? Boom. Done. This statement should be tied up with a bow in less than 140 characters. Why? Because focused content is high-performing content. This statement will help you keep your content on target, on message and on brand &ndash; providing a consistent brand experience across all your digital and other content assets.</p><h3> Step 4: Detail the desired user experience</h3><p> <br/> Pretend you are the audience you are trying to attract with your content. From finding your content to be coming to a client &ndash; sketch out a map of how your content is going to lead them back to your website to take which actions and then what happens after they provide their information.  This is your buyer&rsquo;s journey, so make sure you&rsquo;ve paved the road for your audience to have an easy and enjoyable trip.</p><h3> Step 5: Document the content creation process</h3><p> <br/> How will your brand create content? Document the operational process from brainstorming, creation, revisions, approvals and publishing. Make sure it&rsquo;s clear so that you and others can get into a rhythm that won&rsquo;t bottleneck at a certain point, potentially threatening your ability to maintain a consistent publishing schedule.</p><h3> Step 6: Assign roles for content contributors</h3><p> <br/> Who is in the lead and then who is responsible for copywriting, design, editing, publishing, promoting, tracking performance? Becoming a publisher of your own original content will likely take more than one dedicated resource and so it&rsquo;s good to have your team assembled and on the same page so everyone can work together successfully.</p><h3> Step 7: List out content marketing priorities</h3><p> <br/> You have everything in place and are clear about your business goals and the ultimate purpose of your content. Now it&rsquo;s time to list out a few priorities for your content marketing program. You won&rsquo;t be able to master everything at once, so start with what you most want to accomplish. Building your subscriber list, increasing your audience on social media, driving more traffic to your website &ndash; whatever it is, jot it down.</p><h3> Step 8: Identify and detail your target audience</h3><p> <br/> Build out detailed buyer personas. If you don&rsquo;t document them for you and your team to reference, you are cutting a necessary corner. Who are they, what are they like, what are their primary responsibilities, what are their challenges, how does your business solve their problem, where do they go for information, what are common objections they have for working with you?</p><h3> Step 9: Build out your specific campaigns</h3><p> <br/> This is the nitty gritty! The actual WHAT TO DO of content marketing. Craft campaigns that serve the marketing priorities and don&rsquo;t forget to assign a purpose and desired outcome for the campaign. It&rsquo;s easier to know what to do at this stage when you have so much clarity over what you&rsquo;re ultimately trying to accomplish.</p><h3> Step 10: Set SMART marketing goals</h3><p> <br/> Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely. Based on your marketing priorities and efforts, set some goals so you can remain focused and build motivation and momentum.</p><h3> Step 11: Identify key performance indicators</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a good idea to measure your performance against past performance and industry averages. Success is measured incrementally and comprehensively. Tracking certain KPIs will inform if you&rsquo;re on track to reach your larger goals and alert you to any adjustments you may need to make along the way.</p><h3> Step 12: Generate an editorial calendar for content creation and distribution schedule</h3><p> <br/> Finally, get it scheduled. I mean in it &ndash; all the best ideas in the World will go to Hell in a handbasket if you don&rsquo;t actually schedule it to happen!</p><p> This is the quick and dirty of content marketing strategy! Of course, there is more complexity to nail down each of these steps, but at least you now have a frame of reference to get you started in the right direction.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 17:29:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 17:29:47.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Mg51FH0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/12-step-quick-and-dirty-content-strategy-guide/\", \"post_id\": \"11374\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 17:29:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 17:29:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"12-step-quick-and-dirty-content-strategy-guide\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11373\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5553\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/12-Step-Quick-and-Dirty-Content-Strategy-Guide.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"876\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464375600,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5333,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Overcommited? Why it Could be Destroying Your Leadership","link":"are-you-overcommited-why-it-could-be-destroying-your-leadership","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I have watched a very talented leader self-destruct before my very eyes. He wants to do it all, both professionally and personally.</h3><p> <br/> He works long hours in his office, always taking on tough assignments and additional work. He is the glue that keeps his team members connected and often is the go-to person when conflict flares. He is the person his boss will always choose to represent her in meetings if she is unable to attend. And as if that was not enough, he has a large group of friends who set up all sorts of social gatherings that he never misses. FOMO (Fear of missing out) keeps his evenings and weekends booked.</p><p> Do you know someone like this young leader? Are you in fact similar to this enterprising emerging leader? Can you relate in any way no matter your years working in your career?</p><p> When we are in the middle of our workday, we sometimes get so caught up in the activity level that we forget we are human. We want to do a good job and build a great reputation and can&rsquo;t always see what we are doing to our minds or our bodies. What I have seen happen is that an overcommitted leader keeps going until one day they just stop.</p><p> Here are seven signs that we have become overcommitted:</p><h3> 1. Fatigue is setting in</h3><p> <br/> If we are moving slower and no longer have a jump in our step, we may be experiencing overcommitment. Think about how you are holding your body and moving. Are you dragging? Are you sleepy and not able to keep your eyes open? Does your brain scream- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m exhausted and need a break!&rdquo;</p><p> TIP: Take some R&amp;R time to breathe, rest and think. Get some perspective by stepping back for a few days.</p><h3> 2. Feel Constantly Overwhelmed</h3><p> <br/> When you look at your workload and projects, are you able to keep the deadlines straight? Are you in control of what stages each assignment is in? Is asking for help out of the question? Will one more deliverable crush you?</p><p> TIP: Take a hard look at your projects and initiatives and dump some or reach out for help.</p><h3> 3. Double book withour realizing</h3><p> <br/> When you set up some downtime with your friends or co-workers, did you forget that you had a late global call? Did you block out time on your calendar to work on your presentation? Do you have two meetings at the same time?</p><p> TIP: Build some free time into your day and put all your commitments on your calendar.</p><h3> 4. Redoing our work</h3><p> <br/> If we are so busy moving from project to project without coming up for air, we may end up with sloppy work. Do you find yourself making silly mistakes or even missing big issues? Are you spending lots of time reworking deliverables due to errors or no time for proofreading?</p><p> TIP: Multitasking can be a myth when we need to focus without interruption. Before going on to a new assignment, try to be at a clear breaking point with the other work project.</p><h3> 5. Sense of lonliness</h3><p> Going from activity to activity and not giving ourselves time to connect with others in a meaningful way can lead to us feeling lonely.</p><p> TIP: Make sure to meet people for coffee, lunch or dinner. Set up phone call time to connect with friends and family.</p><h3> 6. Never fee accomplished</h3><p> <br/> Do you have a sense of not being able to reach an end? Does it seem like as soon as you finish one project, there is always another one to be tackled immediately? Is there no finish line in sight?</p><p> TIP: Celebrate when assignments are completed by taking a walk, getting some treat or just sharing the news with a colleague or friend.</p><h3> 7. Not excited about anything</h3><p> <br/> Does nothing excite or energize you these days? Has a rut set in and it is difficult to look forward to another day or project?</p><p> TIP: Identify what brings you joy and energizes you to jump out of bed in the morning. Remind yourself that you are deserving of pursuing your passion in some way and take some action to make it happen.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 17:33:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 17:33:39.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_SSbfqJC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-overcommited-why-it-could-be-destroying-your-leadership/\", \"post_id\": \"11375\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 17:33:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 17:33:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-overcommited-why-it-could-be-destroying-your-leadership\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11373\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5554\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/12-Step-Quick-and-Dirty-Content-Strategy-Guide.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"364\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464339600,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5334,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Happens When Your Department Is Downsized and You're Not","link":"what-happens-when-your-department-is-downsized-and-youre-not","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Being downsized is an awful experience. But keeping your job while everyone around you is downsized isn&rsquo;t always much better.</p><p> At first, you might feel relieved that you still have a job to go to. You&rsquo;ll also feel sympathy for the friends and colleagues who weren&rsquo;t so lucky. But soon enough, you&rsquo;re going to start to feel something different. You&rsquo;re going to feel completely overwhelmed.</p><h3> Dazed and confused</h3><p> <br/> When your department is downsized and you&rsquo;re not, two things typically happen.</p><p> First, you suddenly have a lot more work because you&rsquo;re doing the work of two (or more!) people now. Everyone else you still work with is taking on a lot more, too, so you can&rsquo;t exactly go to them for help. There&rsquo;s so much to do, and you don&rsquo;t know when or how you&rsquo;re supposed to get it all done. This is the &ldquo;dazed&rdquo; phase of not being downsized.</p><p> Second, you&rsquo;ll be taking on new and different types of work, because the colleagues who were let go likely had jobs that were different &ndash; although related &ndash; to the job you&rsquo;ve been doing. You&rsquo;re taking on new tasks that you&rsquo;re not sure you know how to do. How are you supposed to learn it all when you&rsquo;re already snowed under with work? Welcome to the &ldquo;confused&rdquo; phase of not being downsized.</p><p> No wonder you&rsquo;re overwhelmed. One thing that could help you get through this massive change is focusing on the opportunities your expanded role creates.</p><h3> Learn, network, repeat</h3><p> <br/> Take advantage of this challenging time in your career to learn new skills, take courses and network with colleagues and experts who can help you do a great job in your new role.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at an example of a copywriter who, because of downsizing, now has to manage the company blog and social media properties. We&rsquo;ll call them Sam.</p><p> Sam is an excellent copywriter who has written plenty of blog posts, tweets, Facebook and LinkedIn updates and more. No problem there. But someone else has always taken care of the back-end: making sure the blog posts end up on the company website, finding photos for posts, scheduling tweets and other social media updates, and engaging with clients on social media.</p><p> The person who did all of those back-end functions is gone now, and Sam&rsquo;s in charge of it all. This is a great opportunity for Sam to take a course on coding and to reach out to social media experts at other companies. If Sam can&rsquo;t find a coding course in the area, there are online courses for almost everything now.</p><p> The coding course will teach Sam how to get posts up on the blog, choose and size photos that capture attention and troubleshoot issues as they arise. From other social media experts, Sam will learn the best time of day to post on various social media sites, how many times a day to post, how many hashtags is too many, how to handle client interactions on social media, and so much more.</p><h3> Time to move on?</h3><p> <br/> There are opportunities to be had, but we don&rsquo;t want to sugarcoat this. Making time to network and take courses on top of an already increased workload won&rsquo;t be easy. And over the long term, the increased workload could lead to burnout and resentment.</p><p> So Sam may end up looking for another job. Luckily, Sam now has a bunch of new contacts that will make the job search that much easier. Plus, Sam isn&rsquo;t just a copywriter anymore, but a social media expert with coding skills, too. That&rsquo;ll open up a world of possibilities.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to be a copywriter to make this strategy work for you. Think about the types of skills and contacts you need in your new roles &ndash; and that would help you in the next stage of your career &ndash; and get to work on building them.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-26 20:53:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-26 20:53:52.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_Lr0gHdQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-happens-when-your-department-is-downsized-and-youre-not/\", \"post_id\": \"11377\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-26 20:53:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-26 20:53:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-happens-when-your-department-is-downsized-and-youre-not\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11376\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5555\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Happens-When-Your-Department-Is-Downsized-and-Youre-Not.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"911\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464436800,"author_id":126,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5336,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want Influence? Ask Great Questions","link":"want-influence-ask-great-questions","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Personal Influence. Most folks like the notion of having some. My professional practice is predicated on the benefits of getting it.</h3><p> <br/> The right position in the right firm gets us a modicum of influence. Knowing other influential people gets us some more. Presenting innovative ideas &ndash; huh, now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere. The most disarming way of being influential?</p><p> Yep. Ask great questions.</p><p> It&rsquo;s that simple. It&rsquo;s not that obvious. It allows everyone in every organizational function to wield influence. And it needs to be executed with finesse.</p><p> When we hired Leandra Campbell to be the Relationship Manager at my firm, we hired her over more seasoned, more flashy, more obvious candidates. Why did we hire Leandra? In the interview, Leandra asked keenly thoughtful questions.</p><p> Back in the days, when I had my very first assignment as an Executive Coach, I had a session with my client Oliver in which I felt resoundingly inadequate. Oliver talked and talked, and I simply had no insights to offer or any great wisdom to share. I chimed in a few times, remained silent the remainder of our session. It was an utterly excruciating experience for me.</p><p> &ldquo;You were so helpful,&rdquo; Oliver said when we were done.</p><p> Yep. I asked a couple of questions.</p><p> What makes a question a great influencing question? Influencing questions expand the scope of a conversation. They invite fresh perspectives and surprising ways of looking at the familiar. They help others to see things they may have overlooked. They create momentum.</p><h3> Here are 4 ways of influencing a conversation with a question: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Appreciate assets when folks get too critical in their thinking:</h3><p> <br/> What are some things that we&rsquo;re really good at that we don&rsquo;t want to forget? </p><h3> 2. Consider alternative scenarios that have not yet been considered:</h3><p> <br/> I wonder what would happen if __________ ? </p><h3> 3. Broaden the context if a conversation is getting stuck in predictable thinking:</h3><p> <br/> How does what we are considering compare to what companies like ________ are doing? </p><h3> 4. Mine added reasons for pursuing a certain path:</h3><p> <br/> What might be some other considerations that would prompt us to follow this particular course of action?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the finesse part I suggest we never forget. It&rsquo;s as critical &ndash; and influential &ndash; as the questions themselves.</p><li> Pose every question with a sense of childlike curiosity.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t ever try to outsmart a Senior Stakeholder with your question.</li><li> Keep your ego 100% out of the conversation.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t force the flow of the conversation if your question doesn&rsquo;t yield instant insight. Listen &ndash; and then offer another influencing question. <br/>  </li><p> Sometimes we influence with a fresh idea, a new course of action. Here&rsquo;s the gift of influencing with questions: We can do it in the absence of a fresh idea or a new course of action. We can do it any day, anywhere, anytime. We can always be influential.</p><p> I find it profoundly liberating.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-29 14:43:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-29 14:43:59.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_BlZhfy1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-influence-ask-great-questions/\", \"post_id\": \"11381\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-29 14:43:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-29 14:43:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-influence-ask-great-questions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11380\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5557\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Want-Influence-Ask-Great-Questions.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"650\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464609600,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

Put these so-called strategies in the same category as &ldquo;How to Win the Lottery&rdquo; and &ldquo;Making Big Money in Real Estate&rdquo; where only the writers of books, newsletters and the talking heads on the screen are the winners. It&rsquo;s fair to say that hidden forces are manipulating your sensibilities.</p><p> If there&rsquo;s any doubt about the magnetic draw of magical solutions, look at the overwhelming success of the Superhero movies. The answers to salvation lie with those who fly, are blessed with supernatural powers and lots of nifty gadgets.</p><p> But success in your financial life is hinged less on god-like knowledge and more on Ironman will. If you aren&rsquo;t endowed with an MBA in Personal Finance or haven&rsquo;t practiced in the world of Financial Planning, chances you don&rsquo;t have the breadth of knowledge or experience to fly through all the choices necessary to beat back the evil forces.</p><p> Being a superhero of your financial life begins with a clear vision that includes your values and a working knowledge of what&rsquo;s coming in the door and what&rsquo;s flying out. You don&rsquo;t need to be a CPA to understand the flow of your resources. You can use a computer program or the back of an envelope&mdash;whatever works for you.</p><p> But to gain true superhero status, you have to identify your own personal Kryptonite.

Jonathan Clements&rsquo; Money Guide 2016 covers a myriad of financial topics while Plan Your Estate (2016) by Denis Clifford offers solid information on understanding estate planning challenges.

If you&rsquo;re in search of real information about investing, try The Investment Answer by Daniel C. Goldie and Gordon S. Murray and if your habits around money are less than supportive grab a copy of Carl Richards&rsquo; The Behavior Gap.</p><p> To support your learning and knowledge, find a planner who can help you synthesize these materials into your life and your values. Actively work to learn to separate real information from marketing schemes and dastardly contrivances.</p><p> You can pair building super habits&mdash;along with your newly acquired knowledge&mdash;into an unbeatable duo to lead your fight to a rich and satisfying financial life.</p><p> Being a superhero with your money takes dedication, patience and the will to break free of the bonds that limit your real success.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-29 16:04:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-29 16:04:36.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_iE3r4k3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/success-in-your-financial-life-is-hinged-less-on-god-like-knowledge-and-more-on-ironman-will/\", \"post_id\": \"11383\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-29 16:04:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-29 16:04:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"success-in-your-financial-life-is-hinged-less-on-god-like-knowledge-and-more-on-ironman-will\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11382\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5558\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Success-in-Your-Financial-Life-Is-Hinged-Less-on-God-Like-Knowledge-and-More-on-Ironman-Will.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"733\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464602400,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

There are usually 2 things wrong with this assumption:</p><p> <strong>  1. Clients are not all the same at all&hellip;even when they appear to be. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. Clients don&rsquo;t tend to want our technical knowledge &ndash; they want a different outcome in their lives. </strong></p><p> The following is a fabulous summary of some research which highlights the differences in priorities for investment clients.  It covers a range of demographic age groups, and a variety of needs and wants, and highlights that while there are many many things a financial planner or investment advisers might be able to do for a client in any given demographic, there is a fairly broad selection of &ldquo;client wants&rdquo;.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/investor-priorities.png\" width=\"614\"/></p><p> While this research is focussed upon investment clients, I believe that the results will be similar in any other line of professional services.

For example, the Internet transformed the travel service industry as sites like Travelocity decreased the need for travel agents and apps like those created by Uber have shaken the world of taxi drivers forever.</p><p> Recently, Mark Zuckerberg predicted that &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; and robotic computers will replace almost all service professionals. With due respect to the genius of Zuckerberg, I question whether the need for &ldquo;human service&rdquo; will ever become extinct.</p><p> In support of my argument, I lean on two phenomena: a  <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-digital-disconnect-customer-engagement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent study by Accenture </a>  and a hypothesis referred to as the &ldquo;uncanny valley.&rdquo;</p><p> Accenture recently released a study of 24,489 customers in 33 countries and across 11 industries.</p><p> According to that research:</p><li> 83% of U.S. consumers prefer dealing with human beings.</li><li> 65% agree in-store service is the best channel for personalized experiences. <br/>  </li><p> Clearly, technology will have a continually important role in service delivery, as evidenced by Accenture&rsquo;s finding that 73% of study participants expect customer service to be easier and more convenient, and 61% expect it to be faster.</p><p> As for robots replacing human beings, imagine a very human-like computer functioning as a front-desk clerk at a high-end hotel. For the sake of this example, further assume everything about the robot approximates a person (skin tone, simulation of breathing, and algorithms that are able to anticipate consumer responses). Let&rsquo;s even assume the robot can approximate true human empathy.</p><p> If and when all that might be possible, I am convinced there will be a strong underlying resistance from customers. A form of resistance captured in the concept of an  &ldquo;uncanny valley.&rdquo; In a nutshell, the &ldquo;valley&rdquo; refers to a decline in perceptions of machines and other animated objects as those devices take on &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; resemblances to humans. In essence, the more machines resemble humans the less acceptable those machines become to us. Whether it is fear of replacement or our need to interact with service providers like ourselves, human-like machines are &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; and &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo; for most of us.</p><p> While we wait to see whether Mark Zuckerberg is correct, I recommend we merge the best human and technology solutions together in order to produce easy, seamless, consistent, humane, and emotionally engaging experiences for those we serve!

This is especially true in light of the recent spur of acquisitions. The proverbial big fish in the fund industry &ndash;  <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6a441de0-1eac-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122.html#axzz49n7bww7r\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Oppenheimer, JP Morgan Asset Management, Hartford Funds,  </a> and the like &ndash; are swallowing up smaller ETF shops in an effort to stake their claim in the land of smart beta, leaving the ETF &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; in the dust.</p><p> As the big get bigger, what&rsquo;s the fate for the rest of the ETF issuers who are true boutiques in the industry? What happens to the innovators and disruptors who haven&rsquo;t gotten investment from or aligned with the larger investment industry players? The cost of compliance and operations already eats up much of the revenue produced by the first $50 million in AUM. The threat of added regulation will only push that break-even mark higher, thus making the barrier of sustainability that much higher.</p><p> Only time will tell, but what we do know is that strategy alone is no longer enough to fuel organic growth for ETFs. However, if an ETF shop wants to thrive in today&rsquo;s David and Goliath environment, the answer is quite simple&hellip; Market.</p><p> With  <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/white-speech-keynote-address-ici-052016.html\" target=\"_blank\">  1,594 registered as of 2015 and $2 trillion </a>  in net assets, it&rsquo;s no secret that ETFs are proliferating. Growing an ETF to a sustainable &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; level of assets and generating enough market interest to have meaningful trading volume requires more than just a good investment strategy and a market maker. Success going forward will be predicated as much on the coordinated efforts between distribution, marketing and publicity that cultivate interest from investors in the ETF. Like we&rsquo;ve said before, now,  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/why-the-financial-advice-business-needs-to-speak-up-for-itself-now-more-than-ever/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  more than ever </a> , ETFs need to be thoughtfully marketed and publicized to have staying power.</p><p> Already, the process for engaging social media has been tilted in favor of large firms with big budgets as FINRA charges for review of individual tweets and status updates sits around $125. Posting daily, or multiple times per day, is no big deal for the BlackRocks and Vanguards of the industry. For upstarts, the cost to use social media can deter them from leveraging all the channels their bigger competition has at its disposal. You need to be savvy about how you engage marketing, PR, social media and sales to get results on a limited budget.</p><p> Since 2008, our agency &ndash; one of the top 10 financial PR firms in the country, per O&rsquo;Dwyer&rsquo;s &ndash; has been helping ETF issuers craft their brands, develop crisp messaging, build a market presence and magnify the reach of their messages and product stories.</p><p> While there is still plenty of opportunity to be had, there&rsquo;s no denying compliance changes and industry restructuring will present challenges for ETF providers. But it is in choppy waters, especially, when you&rsquo;re going to want to tap your brand equity to pull you through.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-29 16:25:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-29 16:25:26.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_1zRxkcp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/etfs-are-in-the-hot-seat-now-what/\", \"post_id\": \"11390\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-29 16:25:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-29 16:25:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"etfs-are-in-the-hot-seat-now-what\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11389\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5561\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ETFs-Are-in-the-Hot-Seat-Now-What.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"614\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464598800,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5342,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Exactly Is Smart Beta?","link":"what-exactly-is-smart-beta","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The smart beta is actually an umbrella term for investment strategies that utilize alternative methods to construct indexes as opposed to traditional market capitalization weighting. Smart beta emphasizes various investment factors or characteristics in a rules-based and transparent way. Such strategies are often called multifactor investing.</p><p> The smart beta concept can be traced back to academic research, specifically the capital asset pricing model created by Bill Sharpe in the 1960&rsquo;s. Sharpe turned the algebraic equation for a straight line into a market changing theory. His research determined that sensitivity to market volatility in a given security or portfolio, which he labeled beta, explained 70% to 75% of investors&rsquo; returns. Alpha, often considered the active return on an investment, gauges the performance of an investment against a market index used as a benchmark, since they are often considered to represent the market&rsquo;s movement as a whole. The excess return of a fund relative to the return of a benchmark&rsquo;s index is the fund's alpha. Sharpe posited that the other 25% to 30% were considered alpha. <a href=\"https://blog.flexshares.com/what-exactly-is-smart-beta#_edn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [i] </a></p><p> Expounding on Sharpe&rsquo;s research, Eugene Fama and Ken French&rsquo;s seminal work in 1992 <a href=\"https://blog.flexshares.com/what-exactly-is-smart-beta#_edn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [ii] </a>  found that, while beta was the most explanatory factor, size and value were also important in illuminating portfolio performance. They determined that the level of exposure to value and small capitalization stocks, alongside beta, explained 90% or more of returns, leading to the identification of value and small cap as compensated risk factors.

How's Your Team EI?","link":"never-mind-your-iq-financial-advisors-hows-your-team-ei","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Just as there&rsquo;s been a shift in the <a href=\"/fintech-center/run-smarter/5-ways-to-avoid-generational-warfare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  generational attitude of the advisor workplace </a> &ndash; changing how and why people will invest as more millennials enter the market &ndash; there&rsquo;s been a shift in the way people view the idea of teamwork. Whether you run your own practice or collaborate with fellow advisors, most people have been on both teams that work and teams that don&rsquo;t work. But we now have a better idea of <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/want-better-teams-include-more-women/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  what makes a team work </a> &mdash;and it may not be what you think.What makes  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  teams so important in the first place </a> ? &ldquo;Studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems,&rdquo; writes Charles Duhigg in the New York Times. &ldquo;Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.&rdquo;You might think team success is primarily a matter of which people are on the team. In other words, if you could just come up with the right combination of people, any team would be successful. But Google, which has hundreds of teams, examined all its team data in an attempt to answer this question, and found it was something else entirely.</p><h3> What makes a team work</h3>&ldquo;Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions,&rdquo; writes Julia Rozovsky, analyst for Google People Operations (which most companies call HR), in a blog post <a href=\"https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> examining the results of the study</a>.In the study, which it calls Project Aristotle, Google learned there are five major factors behind successful teams:<li> <strong>  Psychological safety: </strong>  Can team members take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed?</li><li> <strong>  Dependability: </strong>  Can team members count on each other to do high quality work on time?</li><li> <strong>  Structure and clarity: </strong>  Are goals, roles, and execution plans clear?</li><li> <strong>  Meaning of work:  </strong> Are team members working on something that is personally important?</li><li> <strong>  Impact of work:  </strong> Do team members fundamentally believe that their work matters?</li>By far, the most important of these is psychological safety. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all reluctant to engage in behaviors that could negatively influence how others perceive our competence, awareness, and positivity,&rdquo; Rozovsky writes. &ldquo;Although this kind of self-protection is a natural strategy in the workplace, it is detrimental to effective teamwork. On the flip side, the safer team members feel with one another, the more likely they are to admit mistakes, to partner, and to take on new roles.&rdquo;Moreover, feeling safe has many broad benefits, she continues. &ldquo;Individuals on teams with higher psychological safety are less likely to leave Google, <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/why_diversity_matters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> they&rsquo;re more likely</a> to <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2015/01/20/new-report-finds-a-diversity-dividend-at-work/\" target=\"_blank\"> harness the power of diverse ideas</a> from their teammates, they bring in more revenue, and they&rsquo;re rated as effective twice as often by executives.&rdquo;<h3> Raising the emotional intelligence of the team</h3>In retrospect, this finding&mdash;which has been<a href=\"https://business.inquirer.net/202780/google-searches-itself-to-build-more-productive-teams?utm_expid=.XqNwTug2W6nwDVUSgFJXed.1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> reinforced by other studies</a>&mdash;isn&rsquo;t terribly surprising.<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2008/02/make-your-good-team-great-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Nor is it new</a>; the behaviors are similarly to those recommended in a 2008 Harvard Business Review article, which called it group &ldquo;emotional intelligence,&rdquo; or EI. What&rsquo;s new is the data backing it up.After all, in a successful team, it&rsquo;s important for people to feel free to suggest ideas. This isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve heard of the necessity of &ldquo;feeling safe&rdquo; as critical for collaboration. For example, the notion of a &ldquo;safe space&rdquo; comes up often in brainstorming, where people need to feel free to suggest any idea&mdash;no matter how nonsensical it might seem&mdash;without having to worry about ridicule.At the same time, it&rsquo;s also important for people to feel free to shoot down plans that they think won&rsquo;t work. Otherwise, team members can succumb to &ldquo;groupthink,&rdquo; or feeling intimidated about going up against what they perceive to be the will of the group&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-you-managing-up-your-boss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> particularly if managers are involved</a>. Both of these situations require people to feel safe in the group.Google went on to create a tool that is intended to help boost the dynamics found in the survey, which it calls the gTeams exercise. &ldquo;Over the past year, more than 3,000 Googlers across 300 teams have used this tool,&rdquo; Rozovsky writes. &ldquo;Of those Google teams, the ones that adopted a new group norm &mdash; like kicking off every team meeting by sharing a risk taken in the previous week &mdash; improved 6 percent on psychological safety ratings and 10 percent on structure and clarity ratings.&rdquo;<h3> Getting the team talking</h3>How can you tell if group members feel safe? A significant factor is whether all the members are contributing roughly equally in meetings. If not, then for whatever reason, people don&rsquo;t feel safe. &ldquo;On the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion,&rdquo; Duhigg writes. &ldquo;On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount.&rdquo;While a number of articles about this study summarized the results as &ldquo;<a href=\"http://qz.com/625870/after-years-of-intensive-analysis-google-discovers-the-key-to-good-teamwork-is-being-nice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Be nice</a>,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s actually more nuance to it than that.&ldquo;By adopting the data-driven approach of Silicon Valley, Project Aristotle has encouraged emotional conversations and discussions of norms among people who might otherwise be uncomfortable talking about how they feel,&rdquo; Duhigg writes. &ldquo;The paradox, of course, is that Google&rsquo;s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.&rdquo;Hear that advisors?

Bill Crager and Jay Hummel have built a wonderful guide for today&rsquo;s financial advisor to do just that.</p><p> The goal of the book is to bring Advisors and Consumers closer together &mdash; a point that seems to be lost on an industry that is swirling in more of what&rsquo;s wrong than what&rsquo;s right.  The book is filled with commentary from far and wide throughout the industry &mdash; some with important bit parts, others with commentary that will leave you wanting more.</p><p> Crager and Hummel believe that today&rsquo;s advisor can add 3% to the value of their clients annually &mdash; which is broken down and explained thoughtfully.  Consumers are dying for this kind of information &mdash; the same consumer that questions this industry as a whole.</p><p> <strong>  Chatzky: </strong> &ldquo;Why do we do things with our money we know are not in our own best interest? More importantly, how do we stop? Advice&mdash;good advice, holistic advice&mdash;is a big part of the answer.&rdquo;</p><p> The question the consumer must always ask is &lsquo;am I receiving objective and disinterested advice.&rsquo; This is underlined and if you&rsquo;re an advisor that can&rsquo;t answer this question, you&rsquo;d better begin pecking on your keyboard and producing bullet points and statements of worth to prove it. Help is provided.</p><p> <strong>  Joe Duran: </strong> &ldquo;People are getting too smart. They are starting to calculate fees in dollars and not basis points and they aren&rsquo;t going to pay tens of thousands of dollars for something they can get with technology.&rdquo; </p><p> That said; the book gives a brutally and thorough look at today&rsquo;s robo advisor, which is brilliantly compared to Napster.  As we know Napster changed everything and then went away &mdash; will we see a similar path?  Then there&rsquo;s the question for this segment of &ldquo;What does a fiduciary duty even look like or mean for a robo advisor?&rsquo; Interesting. Crager and Hummel have opinions here and don&rsquo;t shy away from sharing them.</p><p> <strong>  Michael Kitces </strong> (who makes enlightening points again and again): &ldquo;As an industry, we continue to talk about financial planning being at the center of what we do for clients. What does that mean? The consumer doesn&rsquo;t understand what planning is because every advisor delivers a different product under that term.&rdquo; Enough said.</p><p> As we all know, the meltdown truly impacted millennials views on investing.  So what does the future hold for them? Are they going to follow the path of investing their money because they&rsquo;re told to? Because their parents did? There&rsquo;s a huge &ldquo;trust gap&rdquo; that exists between the industry and the consumer. Is it something that can be overcome? Crager and Hummel suggest that coaching and financial planning are going to be the key building block of advisor value. Trusting institutions, they point out, may be a whole different matter. </p><p> <strong>  Pam Krueger: </strong> &ldquo;Advisors are in the weeds &mdash; they&rsquo;re leaving the old world behind and dealing with so many new technologies. How are they going to explain what&rsquo;s happening to the industry to clients and prospects without sounding defensive or from a pedestal?&rdquo;</p><p> The book asks a number of great, tough questions but doesn&rsquo;t just stop there. Advice is given.  Good advice.</p><p> Crager and Hummel argue, &rdquo;Financial services is not going through an evolution, but a revolution. The consumer is pushing the industry to think differently.&rdquo;</p><p> The future is yesterday, FinServ &mdash; you have a lot of catching up to do. The Essential Advisor is a great start.  Take heed and give it a read. </p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 15:22:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 15:22:43.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_EGZWcbG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/envestnets-bold-attempt-to-inform-and-educate-the-industry-is-fascinating/\", \"post_id\": \"11399\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 15:22:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 15:22:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"envestnets-bold-attempt-to-inform-and-educate-the-industry-is-fascinating\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11398\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5565\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Envestnet\\u2019s-Bold-Attempt-to-Inform-and-Educate-the-Industry-is-Fascinating.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"667\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464685200,"author_id":146,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5345,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Smart Advisors Expect More From Their Firms Than Just a Brand Name","link":"smart-advisors-expect-more-from-their-firms-than-just-a-brand-name","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There was a time when the prevailing belief amongst advisors was that the corporate name on your business card defined your potential to attract and retain clients via the presumption of irrefutable prestige. Names like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan created an aura of professionalism and platform superiority that superseded an advisor&rsquo;s own persona.</p><h3> With crisis comes change</h3><p> <br/> The financial crisis abruptly forced advisors to reevaluate their relationship with their firms. At the worst of the crisis, advisors often had to defend firms whose names had become tarnished &ndash; and in some cases even toxic &ndash; and many advisors chose to distance themselves from the &ldquo;brand&rdquo; in order to preserve or rebuild client confidence. Firms that historically inspired their employees&rsquo; near blind loyalty were now expected to prove themselves every day, with advisors no longer bound by unconditional trust and respect. Even long tenured teams felt justified in questioning what they wanted as their legacy. In a dramatic paradigm shift, quality advisors emerged from the turmoil more comfortable in relying on their own reputations and experience when working with clients and in winning new business.</p><h3> Platform becomes a commodity</h3><p> <br/> Out from under the former mystique of their post-crisis firms, advisors found that the industry had evolved. &ldquo;Platform&rdquo; &ndash; once the exclusive domain of a particular firm &ndash; had virtually become a commodity. Advances in technology were an equalizing force in the industry, and it became rare for one firm to legitimately claim exclusive rights to its capabilities. Even now, where &ldquo;robo-advisors&rdquo; are being scrutinized as the next threat, advisors understand that it&rsquo;s their personal and ongoing relationship with a client that is, and will remain, paramount.</p><p> This realization has allowed quality advisors, more closely connected to their clients than ever, to confidently join firms with little to no name recognition, like HighTower, Snowden Lane or, in certain parts of the country, Raymond James. In the most dramatic examples of relying on their own identities, advisors are creating independent businesses where both the ownership and the brand belong exclusively to them. Furthermore, clients are following their advisors in these moves to new and unfamiliar destinations.</p><h3> Decisions in a new light</h3><p> <br/> For most firms having survived the latest crisis, it&rsquo;s back to business as usual. However, advisors are unlikely to revert back to &ldquo;old habits&rdquo; of putting the name and reputation of a firm ahead of their own. While an advisor may have joined a firm years ago because it was &ldquo;THE&rdquo; place to do business, advisors decide to stay with a firm today not because of what the name means to a client; they stay only when they receive the support and resources they need to service clients and to grow.</p><p> Bottom line is that smart advisors expect more from their firms today than just a brand name. And their clients are recognizing the same: it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;person&rdquo; they call &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; or &ldquo;Susan&rdquo; that&rsquo;s watching out for them and not the corporate name posted outside their door.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 15:34:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 15:34:33.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_xiNhy05.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/smart-advisors-expect-more-from-their-firms-than-just-a-brand-name/\", \"post_id\": \"11401\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 15:34:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 15:34:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"smart-advisors-expect-more-from-their-firms-than-just-a-brand-name\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11400\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5566\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Smart-Advisors-Expect-More-From-Their-Firms-Than-Just-a-Brand-Name.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"931\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464685200,"author_id":50,"chart_url":""}

The daily charge of $20-$40 is expensive, and the coverage often unnecessarily duplicates that provided by your credit cards and personal auto policy</p><p> Before you assume you don't need the rental insurance, though, it's wise to take a closer look at where you'll be traveling and whether your existing coverage will take care of all potential costs. There are times that taking the insurance can alleviate some nasty surprises.</p><p> The insurance can be a good idea if you rent a car outside of the US. As I've discovered first-hand, being in a country where roads double as paths for livestock, or one where people drive on the \"wrong\" side of the road, can increase your risk of minor accidents. While in some countries my US policy will cover damage, I don&rsquo;t enjoy the prospect of spending countless frustrating hours as an intermediary between the foreign rental company and my US insurance carrier. I am happy to pay for the insurance and avoid heated arguments with the rental company over whether any damage was pre-existing, much less the hassle of negotiating repair bills.</p><p> It is important, though, to buy insurance carefully. On a recent trip to South Africa I rented a car and purchased the insurance online. When I returned the car, the agent said I had scratched the paint. Not wanting to waste time arguing, I pointed out I had purchased their insurance, thinking that was the end of the discussion. It wasn't. The insurance offered on the site where I rented the car was a third party policy, not one offered by the car rental company. That meant the car rental company would charge me for the alleged damage. Then it was up to me to slug it out with the third party insurer. This left me taking pictures of the alleged damage, filling out damage reports, and arguing with the rental company agent. By the time I checked in for my flight home, I was tense and stressed: exactly what I intended to avoid by purchasing the insurance.</p><p> Another instance where taking the rental company&rsquo;s insurance can be beneficial is to avoid loss-of-use charges if you damage a rental vehicle. This is a fee the rental company charges to cover the income it loses while a vehicle is in the repair shop. Companies used to absorb this cost, but in recent years they have begun to charge consumers for it. The catch is that the coverage you have through your regular auto insurance or your credit card may not pay loss-of-use charges.</p><p> A few states (Alaska, Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Texas) mandate that insurers automatically pay loss-of-use claims. If you don't live in one of these states, it's a good idea to verify whether your credit card will cover these fees.</p><p> According to <a href=\"https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/posts/loss-of-use-what-it-is-and-how-to-avoid-getting-stuck-with-the-bill-for-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AutoSlash.com </a> , a website focused on helping consumers save money on car rentals, Visa does cover loss-of-use charges. However, it uses \"fleet utilization logs\" from the car rental company to verify the claim. Obtaining those records can take time and be a hassle. MasterCard may cover some loss-of-use charges, but check the restrictions. American Express offers a separate car rental protection policy; the premium is likely to be cheaper than the premium charged by a car rental company.</p><p> Never buying car rental insurance isn't necessarily a wiser choice than always buying it. As the consumer, it's up to you to do enough research to decide whether the insurance is a product you need. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 15:58:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 15:58:03.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_oUxQsn9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/before-you-assume-you-dont-need-car-rental-insurance/\", \"post_id\": \"11403\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 15:58:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 15:58:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"before-you-assume-you-dont-need-car-rental-insurance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11402\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5567\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Before-You-Assume-You-Dont-Need-Car-Rental-Insurance.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"762\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464699600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Because Atoms Make up Everything!","link":"financial-services-why-atomise-your-content-because-atoms-make-up-everything","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Sophie Brown </p><p> Atomisation to a financial services content marketer is the art and science of breaking down larger pieces of content (think: research report, white paper, webinar etc) into smaller, more digestible formats aka atoms. You want to do this because it&rsquo;s the atoms that will drive eyeballs back to your landmark content pieces.</p><p> Think about the hours, days and weeks researching, drafting and perfecting a meaty piece of content, only to have it sit on your website and stagnate. It&rsquo;s just depressing.</p><p> And by disseminating your atoms through your various channels, you&rsquo;re effectively stretching your larger pieces of content out over what could be an entire content calendar. This saves you time in content creation while also increasing visibility and drawing interest back to your original piece.</p><p> Fortunately you don&rsquo;t need a PhD in chemistry to achieve great results with your content.</p><h3> Principles of atomising content for financial services brands</h3><p> <br/> Atomising content involves analysing the content you have produced, pulling it apart into different sections and repurposing it for use across a variety of channels . Here&rsquo;s how:</p><li> <strong>  Zoom in </strong>  &ndash;Extract a single topic or point and make it the subject of a separate blog. For example, an interesting piece of research from a whitepaper, or a particularly salient chapter in an e-book  could stand alone as a shorter blog.</li><li> <strong>  Morph </strong>  &ndash; Can your content be reworked for different platforms? For example, an interesting statistic from your research could be turned into an infographic.</li><li> <strong>  Complement </strong>  &ndash; After you have selected your topic, think about how you could produce further material off the back of a landmark piece. For example, break down a high level whitepaper into a webinar or video to make it more digestible.</li><li> <strong>  Connect </strong>  &ndash; Group relevant content together to make it easier for your audience to explore</li><li> <strong>  Cross-promote </strong>  &ndash; Maximise exposure and facilitate traffic between pieces by promoting related articles. This could be done at the end, or even within, your content pieces.</li><li> <strong>  Atomise </strong> - Recognize noteworthy sections that could be repackaged for different channels. More on this later. <br/>  </li><p> Five top tips to maximize your content lifecycle</p><li> <strong>  Identify your message </strong>  &ndash; Be clear on what you are aiming to achieve and the message you are trying to deliver. For the most part, your message should be to communicate your brand&rsquo;s thought leadership on a particular topic. It should align with your brand messaging, be of interest to your target audience, be optimised for search engines and most importantly, be creative</li><li> <strong>  Create a comprehensive piece of content </strong>  &ndash; Creating a rich piece of content that zooms in on a certain topic provides more opportunity for atomisation. It needs to be useful, contain actionable insights for your target audience and differentiate your brand from the competitors. Example formats include white papers, research reports, webinars and e-books</li><li> <strong>  Atomise and repurpose content </strong>  &ndash; Think creatively about how you can take different sections of your content and reshape it into a variety of formats. For example, you could take a white paper, turn it into a series of blog posts and refine key points into infographics to be shared on social networks</li><li> <strong>  Publish content </strong>  &ndash; Generate greater reach by pushing your content out through a combination of owned and earned channels. Track your traffic and engagement analytics and back the winners i.e. promote the pieces of content driving high quality traffic or enquiries or sign-ups (or whatever your call-to-action objective is) through use of paid channels</li><li> <strong>  Measure and learn </strong>  &ndash; Tracking your content performance is integral to ensuring you are using the appropriate channels and helps when refining your approach for the next campaign <br/>  </li><h3> Choosing the right content formats</h3><p> <br/> Webinars, videos, blog posts and interactive quizzes are a few examples of highly promotable, high impact content formats that will keep your audience awake and interested. These different content formats can also be customised to align with your audience&rsquo;s needs depending on where on the buyer journey they are and the channel through which you are reaching them. For example, a longer-form article would be appropriate to post on LinkedIn, while an attention-grabbing image may be more appropriate for Facebook. For a table on choosing the right formats for your channels, refer to page 18 in BlueChip&rsquo;s playbook  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/content-distribution-financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A Complete Guide to Content Distribution for Financial Services </a> .</p><h3> Optimising your content for search</h3><p> <br/> Beyond amplification techniques, how do you increase your chances of reaching your target audience? SEO, of course!</p><p> Use target keywords to help achieve a higher ranking in search engine results, and therefore be found by your target audience. Follow the best practices and you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to SEO stardom:</p><li> Pinpoint the most salient themes and topics in your content and ensure the appropriate keywords are used accordingly</li><li> Create content that is sharable to encourage backlinks</li><li> Make your content available across multiple devices to avoid getting penalised by Google</li>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 16:10:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 16:10:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_TRlcAuy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-services-why-atomise-your-content-because-atoms-make-up-everything/\", \"post_id\": \"11404\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 16:10:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 16:10:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-services-why-atomise-your-content-because-atoms-make-up-everything\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11405\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5568\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Financial-Services-Why-Atomise-Your-Content-Because-Atoms-Make-up-Everything.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"606\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464696000,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

May is  <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mental Health Month </a> , and it&rsquo;s something near and dear to my heart. While this awareness campaign has been happening every May since 1949, this year&rsquo;s theme of Life with a Mental Illness calls on individuals to share what life with a mental illness feels like for them and tagging their social media posts with #mentalillnessfeelslike. (You can read the collected posts on the  <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/feelslike\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mental Health America </a>  site.) The goal is to break down negative attitudes and misperceptions surrounding mental illness and to let people suffering from mental illness know they&rsquo;re not alone in their feelings or their symptoms. Breaking the silence is an important mission. All too often, mental health issues are hidden away, giving them the power to have a negative impact on our lives.</p><p> I read  an article  in The Atlantic a few years ago by a successful professional and Duke graduate who felt that impact heavily. Despite her passion for telling her story, she used a pen name because &ldquo;The stigma that surrounds mental health is suffocating, and I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable talking about it with most of my friends and family, and certainly not my boss or colleagues.&rdquo; She talks about how the need to keep her mental illness a secret has impacted her professional life, as well as relationships with friends and family. It&rsquo;s a sad and all-too-common story that, hopefully, is beginning to shift.</p><p> As a financial advisor, I&rsquo;m very aware of another often hidden consequence of mental illness: financial distress. I&rsquo;ve learned firsthand that, in many cases, high levels of debt and financial chaos are directly tied to mental health, with financial issues either resulting from or leading to mental health issues. I&rsquo;m not alone in my findings. A  <a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13619321111202313\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2011 study </a>  by a team of UK researchers found that &ldquo;financial strain and debt are strong risk factors for mental-health problems.&rdquo;  <a href=\"http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/108.short\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A separate study in 2012 </a>  found that &ldquo;adults in debt were three times more likely than those not indebt to have (common mental disorders).&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to see the connection. Binging, which often involves spending, is one way to numb the feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression that can come with mental illness. &ldquo;Retail therapy&rdquo; is something people often joke about, but shopping binges are a very real problem for many people with mental health issues. If you&rsquo;re depressed, shopping gives you a way to surround yourself with cheerful people and boost your endorphins with the pleasure of a new purchase. But when shopping becomes binging, it can result in skyrocketing debt&mdash;which causes more stress and, yes, more depression. It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle, and the best way to break that cycle is awareness.</p><p> Clinical psychologist and mental health advocate  <a href=\"http://davidsusman.com/2015/04/30/5-simple-steps-to-reduce-stigma-about-mental-illness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  David Susman </a>  offers these five steps to reduce stigma about mental illness:</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t label people who have a mental illness.</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bipolar&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rsquo;s schizophrenic.&rdquo; People are people, not diagnoses. Instead, say &ldquo;He has a bipolar disorder&rdquo; or &ldquo;She has schizophrenia.&rdquo; All of this is known as &ldquo;person-first&rdquo; language, and it&rsquo;s far more respectful, for it recognizes that the illness doesn&rsquo;t define the person.</p><h3> 2. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of people with mental illness.</h3><p> <br/> Sure, they may sometimes display unusual behaviors when their illness is more severe, but people with mental illness aren&rsquo;t more likely to be violent than the general population. In fact, they are more likely to be victims of violence. Don&rsquo;t fall prey to other inaccurate stereotypes, such as the deranged killer or the weird co-worker depicted in the movies.</p><h3> 3. Don&rsquo;t use disrespectful terms for people with mental illness.</h3><p> <br/> In a research study with British 14-year-olds, the teens came up with over 250 terms to describe mental illness, and the majority were negative. These terms are far too common in our everyday conversations. Also, be careful about using &ldquo;diagnostic&rdquo; terms to describe behavior, like &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my OCD&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rsquo;s so borderline.&rdquo; Given that 1 in 4 adults experience a mental illness, you quite likely may be offending someone and not be aware of it.</p><h3> 4. Don&rsquo;t be insensitive or blame people with mental illness.</h3><p> <br/> It would be silly to tell someone to just &ldquo;buckle down&rdquo; and &ldquo;get over&rdquo; cancer, and the same applies to mental illness. Also, don&rsquo;t assume that someone is okay just because they look or act okay or sometimes smile or laugh. Depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses can often be hidden, but the person can still be in considerable internal distress. Provide support and reassurance when you know someone is having difficulty managing their illness.</p><h3> 5. Be a role model.</h3><p> <br/> Stigma is fueled by lack of awareness and inaccurate information. Model these stigma-reducing strategies through your comments and behavior and politely teach them to your friends, family, co-workers and others in your sphere of influence. Spread the word that treatment works and recovery is possible. Changing attitudes takes time, but repetition is the key, so keep getting the word out to bring about a positive shift in how we treat others.</p><p> I would add one more to his list:</p><h3> 6. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to share your experience with mental illness.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m proud of my daughter Jamie for sharing her story on  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154865557215031&amp;set=a.10150497715440031.466970.696880030&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook </a>  as part of Mental Health Awareness Month. In her post, she shares her experience living with anxiety, OCD, and bi-polar disease, and writes, &ldquo;There is nothing wrong with you, and there is nothing wrong with me. It&rsquo;s a real issue probably facing more people than you will ever realize. Be proud like me that you were able to face your issues, confront them, talk to someone about them and treat them. We all deserve a normal life. We all have struggles. If yours is some kind of mental illness, don&rsquo;t be ashamed. You are not alone. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to share with others&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> While changing perceptions about mental health may not come easily, the shift is happening slowly but surely. My friend&rsquo;s daughter Emma is another great example. In her junior year of high school, she was suffering from severe anxiety and depression. A star student, her condition got so bad that she had to withdraw from regular classes for a semester and continue through independent study. When she returned for her senior year, she agreed to talk about her experience in the school newspaper. The day the paper was distributed, Emma&rsquo;s mother got an urgent call from a close friend. &ldquo;Have you seen the paper?! Did you know she was doing this? Are you ok?&rdquo; And while the friend&rsquo;s reaction was full-blown alarm, when Emma got home from school, she shared a completely different experience. &ldquo;It was great Mom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So many people came up to me and thanked me for doing the interview&hellip;they thought they were the only ones at school who had an issue until I spoke out.&rdquo;</p><p> Hopefully, Jamie and Emma&rsquo;s generation will erase the stigma of mental illness. If they do succeed, I have no doubt we&rsquo;ll all be better off for it&mdash;mentally, socially, and financially</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 16:26:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 16:26:45.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_aGJali9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/has-a-mental-health-issue-impacted-your-personal-finances/\", \"post_id\": \"11411\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 16:26:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 16:26:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"has-a-mental-health-issue-impacted-your-personal-finances\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11410\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5570\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Has-a-Mental-Health-Issue-Impacted-Your-Personal-Finances.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"815\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464703200,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}

Perhaps if we think of &ldquo;Social Selling&rdquo; as &ldquo;Social Influencing&rdquo;, then our thought processes as CEOs might shift.  After all, in today&rsquo;s digitally enabled environment, it is no longer about selling &hellip; it&rsquo;s about influencing the buyer.</p><p> The demands of the job are great, but we wouldn&rsquo;t have the job if it weren&rsquo;t for our clients.  It&rsquo;s our responsibility to be transparent, provide thought leadership, and listen to what it is that our prospects, referral partners, COI&rsquo;s, and clients want.  It is our responsibility to contribute to making their day-to-day lives and routines a little more impactful. </p><p> Here are 3 things that you can do on LinkedIn as a CEO that will impact and influence your professional network on a regular basis.  Dedicate 20 minutes per day&hellip; baby steps at first.</p><li> <strong>  Optimize your LinkedIn Profile. </strong> Better yet,  <a href=\"http://allaboutleveragellc.com/what-we-do/linkedin-profile-optimization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  have your profile optimized. </a>   Be sincere, transparent, and open.  Yes, optimizing your LinkedIn Profile will help you get found faster in LinkedIn and Google searches.  But don&rsquo;t forget to show your personality and sincerity with the content on your profile.  Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to exhibit your subject matter expertise.  Yes, the summary and experience sections are important.  Don&rsquo;t forget about your volunteer work, organizations, awards, certifications, interests (professional as well as personal), publications, patents, and recommendations.  Also use your profile to feature videos, marketing materials, slide decks, and case studies.  Even though it&rsquo;s your profile, it&rsquo;s not for you, it&rsquo;s for the people that are taking the time out of their day to visit it.  As CEO, your personal brand IS the brand.  A  <a href=\"http://www.webershandwick.com/uploads/news/files/Social-CEO-Study.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study by Weber Shandwick </a>  backs up this observation: 68 percent of customers say their perception of a CEO directly impacts their perception of the company.    Your profile should be a landing page that reflects your capabilities as a professional and relationship builder.</li><li> <strong>  Leverage the LinkedIn Publisher and showcase your thought leadership. </strong>  The publisher can be leveraged to influence, teach, listen, engage, and prospect.</li><li> <strong>  Leverage LinkedIn to listen. </strong>  LinkedIn allows us the ability to listen to our entire networks or hyper-focus on specific individuals.  Take a genuine interest in the topics that your network cares about, and engage them in conversation right on LinkedIn.  Like, comment, share.  LinkedIn Groups are another excellent venue for listening. <br/>  </li><h3> Here are some best practices: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Consider your LinkedIn profile an on-going project. </strong> Update it regularly but always be purposeful with your updates.</li><li> <strong>  Spend 10 minutes per day engaging in conversation on LinkedIn with your network. </strong> If you engage with 2-3 prospects, clients, and referral partners per day &ndash; that&rsquo;s less than 1 hour per week that you have spent engaging with 10-15 professionals that are important to your business. </li><li> <strong>  Publish on LinkedIn&rsquo;s Publisher with pure thought leadership a minimum of twice per month. </strong> Our best practice here at All About Leverage, is to publish answers to questions we commonly hear from our prospects, clients, and professional partners.  If you do that you will never run out of content to write about. <br/>  </li><p> Remember:</p><li> Be the first to give to your new business relationships</li><li> Always pay it forward</li><li> Network with purpose. <br/>  </li><p> Good luck and good networking!

Now I know he never put my name on those deeds&mdash;then he sold the properties for millions. Where is that money?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;He wants a divorce? I knew things weren&rsquo;t perfect but I never thought he wanted out!&rdquo;</p><h3> There are so many ways women can be financially blindsided in their marriages.</h3><p> <br/> Through years of experience as a  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  divorce financial adviser </a> working exclusively with women, I&rsquo;ve known husbands to go to  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-a-landers/is-your-husband-hiding-as_b_832383.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  great lengths </a>  to keep assets out of a divorce settlement&hellip; often entirely behind their wives&rsquo; backs.</p><p> According to  <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/01/24/husband-secretly-divorced-wife-after-wedding-to-protect-assets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  an article </a>  in the New York Post, Cristina Carta Villa can probably relate. Her husband Gabriel reportedly pulled a truly extraordinary stunt: A few months after they were wed, and unbeknownst to Cristina, it seems he filed for and obtained a divorce in the Dominican Republic. Here&rsquo;s a woman who was evidently completely blindsided not only by her husband&rsquo;s wish to be divorced, but by finding out she already wasdivorced, some 20 years after the fact!</p><p> Cristina&rsquo;s first clue came in the mail, in the form of what she thought to be a routine tax bill for the Manhattan condominium she and Gabriel shared. Believing she was part owner of the property, Cristina was reportedly puzzled that her name wasn&rsquo;t on that bill. Her &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; was discovered when she hired an attorney to investigate the matter. According to thePost, Gabriel claims that because he and Cristina are divorced, he is the sole owner of the condo. Cristina has since filed suit to nullify this divorce, which she says she did not know about and absolutely would not have agreed to. (We can only wonder whether she plans to file for divorce herself, once the suit about the Dominican divorce is resolved.)</p><p> Obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot we don&rsquo;t know about the details of this case, including why the divorce was sought in the Dominican Republic, and the validity of a divorce reportedly obtained in a country where neither spouse lives and which was reportedly not recorded in their home state of New York. (For information about divorces in which dual citizenship is a factor, please see my  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/01/10/small-world-big-problem-divorces-involving-dual-citizenship/\" target=\"_blank\">  previous article </a>  on the topic.)</p><p> In its sheer audaciousness, though, the Villas&rsquo; story reminds me of the case of  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/10/22/how-far-some-men-will-go-to-get-out-of-dividing-assets-in-divorce/\" target=\"_blank\">  Michael and Debra Mandelbaum </a> , who were also married for more than 20 years. Mr. Mandelbaum didn&rsquo;t secretly file for divorce abroad; rather, he claimed that he and Debra were never legally married in the first place! Further, he contended that since they were never legally married, they can&rsquo;t get legally divorced&hellip; which of course would free him from having to divide assets with Debra now that they&rsquo;re breaking up.</p><p> It&rsquo;s truly amazing how far some men will go to keep a fair divorce settlement from their wives.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the moral of Ms. Carta Villa&lsquo;s story? From my professional perspective, it&rsquo;s this:</p><h3> Where your finances are concerned, be aware, and be involved.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s difficult to deceive someone who knows what&rsquo;s what and can identify any  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2012/03/20/21-signs-that-your-husband-may-be-hiding-marital-assets-during-your-divorce/\" target=\"_blank\">  red flags </a> . The more you actively participate in managing marital finances&mdash;including major long-term decisions as well as day-to-day spending&mdash;the less likely it is your husband will be able to pull off some underhanded maneuvering.</p><p> So please, stay financially aware and involved throughout your marriage. It&rsquo;s not enough to get up to speed and then back off. If you find that you&rsquo;re increasingly leaving financial matters for your husband to handle on his own, it&rsquo;s time to turn that situation around, because as you&rsquo;ve just read, crazy curveballs do happen! Cristina Carta Villa, perhaps believing all was well, appears to have been thrown a doozy&mdash;and had she not given that tax bill a careful look, she might not have known anything was amiss.</p><p> ###</p><p> <strong>  Reminder: </strong>  My clients can tell many a tale of their exes&rsquo; lies, cheating, and all manner of attempted deceptions. The best of these stories are the ones in which deceitful intentions are exposed and foiled, and fair judgment prevails. Unfortunately, though, they don&rsquo;t all work out that way, and many husbands do get away with  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2011/06/28/five-ways-to-tell-if-your-husband-is-hiding-assets/\" target=\"_blank\">  hiding assets </a>  in divorce.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip:  </strong> If you&rsquo;re starting from scratch, begin by learning about everything you own (your assets) and everything you owe (your liabilities). A complete inventory of assets and liabilities is an excellent first step towards building a working knowledge of marital finances.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters: </strong>  A prenuptial agreement can save untold time and anguish if your marriage ends in divorce. If Mr. Villa was concerned about keeping certain assets as separate property, he would have been better advised to work out an agreement to that effect than to try to obtain a divorce overseas, which an American court may well not recognize.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 17:03:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 17:03:14.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_w72no5l.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-be-blindsided-even-happily-married-women-need-to-watch-for-crazy-financial-curveballs/\", \"post_id\": \"11414\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 17:03:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 17:03:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-be-blindsided-even-happily-married-women-need-to-watch-for-crazy-financial-curveballs\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11412\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5572\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Leadership-Teams-Who-Use-Social-Media-to-Communicate-Are-Viewed-as-More-Trustworthy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"974\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464710400,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5352,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Leaders Develop Leaders, Not More Followers","link":"leaders-develop-leaders-not-more-followers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Besides the celebration, what happens if you get a promotion? What if you need to leave your company for some reason or you find yourself called to a different path in life? If any of these occur, what happens to your team? A great leader is always on the lookout for people they can teach and mentor. They search not for more followers but for potential leaders who can replace them. They develop leaders, not more followers.</p><p> So how do you develop another you? Another great leader? Begin with these four methods.</p><h3> Give them experiences tailored to leadership.</h3><p> <br/> As a manager or leader, you have certain tasks that are not required of anyone but you. Find ways that your potential leaders can gain experience in those areas. If you make a presentation once a month, allow your mentee to try her hand at it. As you develop their leadership skills, watch for unique talents they can apply to managing. Look for skills that you didn&rsquo;t use because you didn&rsquo;t have that talent. Allow them to see behind the curtain and try their hand at the parts of your position that are invisible to most.</p><h3> Teach them to network.</h3><p> <br/> Networking events can be painful and awkward, but great leaders jump in and do the work no matter how they feel. Teach your candidates how to network by having them follow you and watch how you initiate conversations. After they&rsquo;ve witnessed your techniques for a while, they will be equipped to network independently. Networking is extremely valuable no matter the job. Giving your mentee the chance to cultivate abilities and confidence in networking is vital to the future of your company. As they progress into leadership roles, they&rsquo;ll already have contacts and people skills.</p><h3> Allow them to fail.</h3><p> <br/> E.M Forster said, &ldquo;Spoon feeding in the long run teaches us nothing but the shape of the spoon.&rdquo;</p><p> It is highly beneficial for your leaders-in-training to fail, so you need to give them that chance. Push them to figure out problems on their own and then allow them to act on the wrong solution. Micromanaging will not teach your candidates how to stand on their own when they move into the leadership role. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean allowing their failures to affect the company while you just watch. But little by little, allow your leaders-in-training more responsibility.</p><h3> Trust them to lead.</h3><p> <br/> Just as it is difficult to watch your child leave your nest, it is a hard decision to allow your leader-in-training to leave your watchful eyes to lead independently. In order to complete the development of a leader, you must take your hands off the result. Think about it: If you teach your leader-in-training how to make smart, informed decisions, but still require that they run every idea by you before they&rsquo;re allowed to make a move, how empowered will they feel?</p><p> Begin now to look around and select employees that you see have potential for leadership. If you do leave your company or your current position, you will have a succession plan in place for continued growth without you.</p><p> Leaders develop more leaders.</p>Sources:<a href=\"http://guides.wsj.com/management/managing-your-people/how-to-develop-future-leaders/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://guides.wsj.com/management/managing-your-people/how-to-develop-future-leaders/</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2010-02-16/how-companies-develop-great-leadersbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2010-02-16/how-companies-develop-great-leadersbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2013/06/25/5-strategies-that-will-turn-your-employees-into-leaders/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2013/06/25/5-strategies-that-will-turn-your-employees-into-leaders/</a>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 17:28:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 17:28:52.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_jA9d1sI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/leaders-develop-leaders-not-more-followers/\", \"post_id\": \"11416\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 17:28:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 17:28:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"leaders-develop-leaders-not-more-followers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11415\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5573\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Leaders-Develop-Leaders-Not-More-Followers.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1652\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464714000,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

Are you accountable? When you give your word, is it ironclad? It&rsquo;s easy to make promises, and even easier to go back on them. If you want people to rely on you&mdash;in business and in life&mdash;you need to be reliable. The same goes for the products or services you sell.</p><p> Sounds obvious? Well, it&rsquo;s amazing how many brands find out the hard way what happens when you don&rsquo;t deliver on your promises. As consumers, we all put some level of trust in what&rsquo;s &ldquo;on the box.&rdquo; We trust that our favorite low-fat snack really is low in fat, and that the MPG advertised for our vehicle is what we&rsquo;ll really get on the highway. If we find out that the company in question wasn&rsquo;t advertising truthfully, then we end our relationship with that company right away. Personal, and professional relationships too, are often derailed when deception is uncovered. Even the appearance of deception can spell doom.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Make Promises You Can&rsquo;t Keep</h3><p> <br/> We make little promises all the time, often without really thinking about it. I&rsquo;ll call you back after lunch, or I&rsquo;ll send you that study when I get in the office tomorrow. Every one of those promises&mdash;big and small&mdash;is an opportunity to show that you mean what you say&hellip; or not. Here are some examples:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-28/vw-posts-3-85-billion-third-quarter-loss-on-emissions-scandal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The VW Emissions Scandal </a>  is an unprecedented, extreme example that will generate case studies for decades. In addition to the billions in lost revenue that occurred in recalls, the brand took a huge hit in the trust department. Winning back the confidence of millions of consumers in Europe and the US who thought they were getting an eco-friendly vehicle is a challenge no business wants to face.</p><p> Less extreme examples happen all the time and still carry steep consequences. An all-natural food turns out not to be so natural. You provide your email address to a company that promises not to share it, then find a mysterious uptick of spam in your inbox. You reserve a seat on a flight only to find out after going through airport security that it&rsquo;s overbooked.</p><p> Phone calls are the perfect person-to-person example. It&rsquo;s so easy to call 10 or 20 minutes after you said you would. No big deal, right? Everyone&rsquo;s busy. Meanwhile, the person expecting your call blocked out time just for you, and now that time is wasted.</p><h3> Trust takes time, and it&rsquo;s hard to win back once you lose it.</h3><p> <br/> When a customer or colleague finds out they&rsquo;ve been misled&mdash;even by accident&mdash;they&rsquo;re more likely to move on than stick around to see if you make up for it.</p><p> When we were kids, teachers, parents and coaches called it accountability. Get your homework done on time, and show up to soccer practice with your cleats and shin-guards. Don&rsquo;t cheat on exams or spend your lunch money on something else. You learn (after making some mistakes) what the consequences were for screwing things up. After a certain age, we call this &ldquo;integrity.&rdquo; And the stuff we learned in school still applies&hellip; and means so mech more. Did you make a commitment? Stick to it. Did you twist the truth? Straighten it out.</p><p> In business, did you deliver what you promised, when and how you said you would? Don&rsquo;t give yourself the option for any answer other than, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Your personal and professional relationships depend on it. A &ldquo;brand&rdquo; is what a business/person does; a &ldquo;reputation&rdquo; is what people remember and share.</p><p> This originally appeared on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ted Rubin </a> .</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 17:43:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 17:43:31.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_yABuk9S.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/brands-say-what-you-mean-mean-what-you-say/\", \"post_id\": \"11418\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 17:43:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 17:43:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"brands-say-what-you-mean-mean-what-you-say\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11417\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5574\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Brands-Say-What-You-Mean-Mean-What-You-Say.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"294\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464789600,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

May Need to Be More Inclusive of Millennials","link":"why-microsoft-and-you-may-need-to-be-more-inclusive-of-millennials","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We&rsquo;ve all seen them: the corny commercials, the advertisements that are more embarrassing than they are informative. It&rsquo;s difficult to create a marketing and advertising campaign that&rsquo;s effective. It&rsquo;s especially difficult if you aren&rsquo;t actually working in an office with members of your target demographic. How can you target products to middle-aged women if your brainstorming session is made up of men? How do you market to millennials when you haven&rsquo;t bothered to talk to one?</p><p> The simple answer is, you can&rsquo;t. Rather, you can, but it&rsquo;s not likely to achieve the results you&rsquo;re hoping for. If you need more proof of this, just look at Microsoft. According to Daniel Victor&rsquo;s New York Times article  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/technology/microsoft-created-a-twitter-bot-to-learn-from-users-it-quickly-became-a-racist-jerk.html\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;Microsoft Created a Twitter Bot to Learn From Users. It Quickly Became a Racist Jerk,&rdquo; </a>  Microsoft created a Twitter bot named @TayandYou. Originally, Tay was simply supposed to converse with other Twitter users by &ldquo;mimicking&rdquo; what users said. In the end, the effort was a complete and total fail. Microsoft shut the bot down less than 24 hours later because the bot started spewing racist and inappropriate tweets.</p><h3> Microsoft blames the failed experiment on Twitter users who manipulated the bot into saying those things.</h3><p> <br/> Really though, the whole idea of creating the bot in first place says more about Microsoft being out of touch with millennials than anything else. According to Victor, &ldquo;Microsoft said the artificial intelligence project had been designed to &lsquo;engage and entertain people&rsquo; through &lsquo;casual and playful conversation,&rsquo; and that it was built through mining public data. It was targeted at 18- to 24-year-olds in the United States.&rdquo; Going a step further, Tay&rsquo;s Twitter bio read, &ldquo;Microsoft's A.I. fam from the internet that's got zero chill!\"</p><p> This marketing flop suggests that Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t done an effective job of connecting with the millennial market. If they had, they would have learned that while &ldquo;zero chill&rdquo; is a phrase used by some millennials, when used by Microsoft it comes across as trying too hard. Members of Generation Y also might have cautioned Microsoft to ditch the bot altogether. After all, real social media engagement is social&mdash;not automated.</p><p> Trying to reach out to, and engage, a specific market segment? What are you doing to listen to, and understand, that segment? Are members of that demographic part of your marketing team? Represented among senior leadership or on your board? If not, there&rsquo;s a good chance that you&rsquo;re missing some key input and information that could help you be more successful&mdash;and help you avoid the kind of misstep that Microsoft recently made.</p><p> We call this &ldquo;key employee demographics required for growth&rdquo;&mdash;a conscious, and concerted, effort to ensure that you&rsquo;re surrounding yourself with, and receiving input from, members of your key target audiences. Those key external audiences should be directly reflected in the demographics of your employees, your leaders, and your board.</p><p> Are they?</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 17:50:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 17:50:51.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_fcGYknx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-microsoft-and-you-may-need-to-be-more-inclusive-of-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"11420\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 17:50:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 17:50:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-microsoft-and-you-may-need-to-be-more-inclusive-of-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11419\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5575\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Why-Microsoft-and-you-May-Need-to-Be-More-Inclusive-of-Millennials.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"531\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464688800,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5355,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Your Way of Working Hindering Your Performance?","link":"is-your-way-of-working-hindering-your-performance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Mindfulness has been all the rage in recent years. Numerous leaders have come out to praise the benefits of &lsquo;being present&lsquo;. But are you aware of your current way of working really hindering your performance?</p><p> In the  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/books/book-review-happier/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  book review for &lsquo;Happier&rsquo; </a> , I&rsquo;ve shared how Tal Ben-Shahar advises using an hourly chime to interrupt your day. So that you can ask yourself whether or not you are still focussed on your priorities. It&rsquo;s a good idea, but one I find hard to maintain, especially in open plan offices or with client meetings.</p><h3> Ask yourself a question</h3><p> <br/> In his book &ldquo;Triggers: Creating behaviour that lasts &ndash; becoming the person you want to be&ldquo;, leading executive coach &amp; management guru  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coachgoldsmith\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Marshall Goldsmith </a>  shares that he too has a list of questions he asks himself. Apparently his list has now grown to 29 questions (things like &ldquo;Have I done my best to exercise/set goals/have positive interactions with others?&rdquo;). He asks these of himself daily, to disturb his routine &amp; check-in, so as to ensure he is doing what matters most to him.</p><p> So, if you were going to tackle just 2 or 3 things that currently hinder your best performance at work, what would they be?</p><p> When I asked myself that, 3 things sprung to mind:</p><li> eMail &amp; Social Media alerts (i.e. mastering distractions);</li><li> the lethargy that corporate office spaces can induce;</li><li> working for too many hours straight. <br/>  </li><h3> Can you master Digital Distraction?</h3><p> <br/> To achieve the first, try turning off your phone &amp; laptop alerts/notifications. I know that sounds like suggesting detox these days, but the benefits of no interruptions can be tremendous. If you haven&rsquo;t tried it and are recognising that your &lsquo;multi-tasking&rsquo; might actually be counter productive, I challenge you try it next time you have an important task to complete.</p><p> Try turning off your smartphone &amp; possibly disconnecting from wifi/network, so no alerts will interrupt your focus on the task at hand. How much more did you get done? Did you find an uninterrupted time like that also made you more creative?</p><p> If you did identify with that greater spark of creativity, you might also be interested in some  <a href=\"http://www.landrover.com/experiences/news/creative-spaces.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent research sponsored by Land Rover </a> . In that survey, organisational psychologist Sir Cary Cooper asked 900 leaders in UK, USA &amp; China about thinking creatively.</p><h3> Is your office a barrier?</h3><p> <br/> Interesting, the results reveal that the office is where most of those leaders feel least creative. When asked: &lsquo;Where are you at your most creative &amp; have your best ideas?&rsquo; Only 3% cited the office, whereas 48% said home &amp; 18% &lsquo;on the move&rsquo;. This tallies with the environmental factors they identified as needed for creative thought:</p><li> Comfortable seating</li><li> Absence of noise</li><li> Natural lighting <br/>  </li><p> My own journey, from 25 years in corporate offices, to leading my own business &lsquo;on the move&rsquo;, at home &amp; in various other comfortable locations, confirms this. It has been so much easier to have  the creative ideas needed for blogging, product development, speaking &amp; coaching sessions whilst in non-office environments.</p><h3> Should you work fewer hours?</h3><p> <br/> One final thought, comes from a  <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/OECD-2015-The-future-of-productivity-book.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  report published by the OECD </a> . It should make sobering reading for all of you who are climbing the corporate ladder in your insight career by working long hours. Analysing the hours worked and the productivity per capita of OECD member states between 1990-2012, it suggests you should work fewer hours.</p><p> The numbers appear to show a clear pattern, that the fewer hours a country spends working, the more productive it is. The UK are 7th amongst the G7 (&amp; 17th in the G20) with regards to productivity, but also have the longest average working hours. Meanwhile Germany tops the table. It has the lowest average working hours (35 hour week) &amp; is also the most productive per capita.</p><p> Personally, I&rsquo;m not surprised by these results. Just like the importance of sleep, sufficient rest &amp; time outside of the office focussed on the other priorities in your life can definitely sharpen your thinking &amp; raise your motivation.</p><p> So, what do you plan to do? Will you work fewer hours, turn off your phone &amp; go out of the office to think?</p><p> Try it. Changing your way of working might just surprise you&hellip;</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 17:58:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 17:58:04.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_G0jewHu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-your-way-of-working-hindering-your-performance/\", \"post_id\": \"11422\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 17:58:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 17:58:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-your-way-of-working-hindering-your-performance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11421\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5576\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Is-Your-Way-of-Working-Hindering-Your-Performance.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"514\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464717600,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}

Their Snapchat handles are included in parentheses.</p><p> The deal is, and it&rsquo;s no secret &ndash; managing is a not an easy endeavor whether it&rsquo;s in-house or with contracted/remote workers.</p><p> I will outline several strategies to be successful with remote management, but there&rsquo;s a singular element that MUST be an active part of everything we do &ndash; communication.</p><p> Tough love time &ndash; I believe that communication solves everything, and to bypass it when managing a team (regardless of our busy schedules) is foolish. Teams are a direct reflection of our investment, and if it&rsquo;s not working then it&rsquo;s time to take an objective look in the mirror.</p><p> As managers, we can&rsquo;t control everything or everyone, but we can be purposeful about learning to be better at what we do on a consistent basis.</p><p> &ldquo;But how do I manage a team that I can&rsquo;t see? How do I stay on top of what they&rsquo;re doing? Or ensure they aren&rsquo;t off playing video games or shopping at the mall?&rdquo;</p><p> Short answer is &ndash; you don&rsquo;t.</p><p> And quite frankly, as long as their work is in process and/or complete, it shouldn&rsquo;t matter what they&rsquo;re doing. Your main focus is getting the work done in the most efficient time with the brightest quality. And that comes by respecting the people you work with, giving trust, communicating, and providing systems to grow a happy environment.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s jump into the main components of managing a remote team successfully, and I&rsquo;ll interweave the wisdom shared via my Snapchat community.</p><h3> 1. Learn how to interact with your team on an individual level.</h3><p> <br/> Personality tests have always been fascinating. I love running them on myself and those in my life, so it was no different when I brought together a team in 2014.</p><p> My initial team at  <a href=\"http://archdigitalagency.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ARCH </a>  was comprised of people I knew well. They were personal friends and social media colleagues, so trust came innately. But it quickly became obvious that I needed to know them more intimately, i.e. how they work best, what they&rsquo;re most passionate about, and what they love doing outside of work.</p><p> A few years back, I read &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.5lovelanguages.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The 5 Love Languages </a> ,&rdquo; and it gave me a deeper understanding of my loved ones. Fortunately, the author had just released &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.appreciationatwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The 5 Languages of Appreciation in the Workplace </a> ,&rdquo; which was the same book with a business frame of mind.</p><p> At ARCH, this test is one of the first introductions to who we are as a team. It&rsquo;s the first thing a new member does, and their results are posted on the team Slack channel. It generate discussion, and as a manager it helps me to understand all the important things &ndash; how to communicate when they mess up, how they communicate best, and how they receive praise.</p><p> While some managers may scoff at such an idea, it has been monumental in helping me understand my team, and provide them communication in a manner best suited for them as individuals.</p><p> &ldquo;The key is to earn the trust of those you work with and serve as a leader who motivates and drives the team,&rdquo; says Morgan Mandriota (@morgmand).</p><p> When we take an active interest in the people we work with it sets everyone up for success.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve worked with managers who didn&rsquo;t give a crap about me unless I performed, which made me feel used. Or didn&rsquo;t provide me feedback on my work, which left me frustrated and confused about how well I was doing.</p><p> As you can imagine, neither one of those scenarios garnered anything close to my best work. Treat your team the way you would want to be treated, and never lose sight of that perspective.</p><h3> 2. Set clear expectations.</h3><p> <br/> This is a biggie.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve worked for companies that didn&rsquo;t set clear expectations, and it leads to insecurity, doubt, and failure. Also, you can almost guarantee they won&rsquo;t ever satisfy you.</p><p> Setting clear expectations from the start is important because it paves the way for success on both ends of the relationship. When someone knows what they&rsquo;re responsible for, they have clear guidelines for what must be done and how they will be measured.</p><p> But setting clear expectations means you have to slow down to be clear and concise. More than once, I assigned something only to have the person come back with questions or frustrations. And when looking at what was communicated, I shook my head at how poorly it was executed because I didn&rsquo;t stop and fully explain.</p><p> &ldquo;My #1 tip would be.. you must ensure everyone has a clear understanding of the work they must do and how they will be measured,&rdquo; says Michael Abrams (@michaeltabrams).</p><p> You think setting expectations is a waste of time? Think about ALL the time you&rsquo;ll lose when they&rsquo;re baffled and/or try to do it and can&rsquo;t. Or do it incorrectly.</p><p> Bleh, right?!</p><p> Save yourself the aggravation.</p><h3> 3. Accountability must occur in front of the team.</h3><p> <br/> This was a huge learn for me.</p><p> Not long after launching ARCH, I realized that staying on top of everyone was a major waste of my time, made them feel like I was micro-managing, and created a lot of irritation. These guys were used to working independently, so I needed to come up with a creative solution to allow me to stay on top of what we completed and respect their space.</p><p> Thankfully, I found the solution in  <a href=\"https://home.idonethis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  idongethis </a> , an app that allows employees to record tasks they&rsquo;ve completed or are in the process of completing for that day. At the end of the day, it sends out an email reminder to update it with any tasks that haven&rsquo;t been included. And the next morning, it sends out a full report to everyone on progress.</p><p> It integrates with Slack (more on that later), incorporates a messaging element (so team members can comment on tasks completed), and is super easy to use.</p><p> It saves me time and makes the team happy because I don&rsquo;t need to constantly check in and find out what is being done. And most importantly, it creates a team vibe because they see what others are accomplishing.</p><h3> 4. Utilize the right tools.</h3><p> <br/> Tools, tools, tools &ndash; there are so many! It&rsquo;s crucial to your the team that the right tools are discovered and put to use. It&rsquo;s also crucial to not jump around with new tools unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary.</p><p> &ldquo;The vast majority of your communication will take place on email, Slack, calls, etc. You need to be able to communicate what you are working on and what your teammates can help with on a consistent basis,&rdquo; said Jessica Malnik (@JessicaMalnik).</p><p> More tough love &ndash; do NOT expect your team to use what you don&rsquo;t and/or incorporate anything into practice that you don&rsquo;t. We are the managers, we&rsquo;re the leaders, and we must always lead by example.</p><p> Due to the nature of my agency, I chose to incorporate tools that could be used from anywhere, on any device, and be easily adaptable at any time.</p><p> <strong>  ARCH tools are as follows: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1.   <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Slack  </a>  . </strong> This is our team messaging platform. It integrates with almost everything, namely Google docs, Dropbox, idonethis, etc. They have an excellent iOS app, so it can be used on the go. It allows for public and private discussions, houses projects, and is SEARCHABLE. We need to be able to locate information, files or discussion at any given moment. In addition, and most importantly, Slack GREATLY cuts back on email. You should not use email for anything that isn&rsquo;t necessary because it can get lost or overlooked. My team knows that virtually all communication is via Slack, unless it&rsquo;s with a client.</p><p> <strong>  2.   <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Asana  </a>  . </strong> This is our project management platform. Initially, we used Teamwork, but found it to be too bulky and complicated for our projects. I used Asana on a personal basis for a few years, like the simplicity, and for time sake chose to utilize it as the project management platform. I can color code (one of my favorite things in life), assign projects and tasks, easily create team calendars and to-do lists, and house client information.</p><p> Bottom line, sometimes the best app isn&rsquo;t the new, fancy one, but the one you&rsquo;re used to using &ndash; as a manager. It&rsquo;s important to make a choice that is easy to explain to the team because they&rsquo;ll have questions on how to use it, and you should know and/or have a quick way to find out. Chances are that if you&rsquo;re struggling with a tool, they are too.</p><p> <strong>  3. idonethis. </strong> Mentioned above in #3, this is a major component to running a successful remote team &ndash; the ability to track where folks are at in their workflow and what they&rsquo;re doing easily.</p><p> <strong>  4.   <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google docs  </a>  . </strong> This is where the lion-share of our systems and client information is shared. It&rsquo;s a paid account, so it&rsquo;s secure. Pro tip: Use it for media instead of Dropbox. It&rsquo;s crazy cheap, and will give you the same features.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s it!</p><p> The best advice I can give you concerning tools is to find what works and stick with it. There&rsquo;s always going to be a new toy on the market to play with, but it&rsquo;s not worth your time or your team&rsquo;s time to learn if it doesn&rsquo;t fulfill a major need.</p><h3> 5. Create in-house atmospheres by personal interactions.</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever been on a conference call and everyone is trying to speak while also trying to be polite? Have you been working online for so long that you forget who&rsquo;s on the other side? Do you find yourself communicating too emotionally?</p><p> I think the online community suffers from a lack of compassion, and I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that is our fault. It&rsquo;s easy to forget we are dealing with legit humans on the other side because our world&rsquo;s largest mode of operating is via electronic equipment.</p><p> &ldquo;Communication is KEY.. and often. Via video and audio conference calls, we held meetings EVERY week, even if there wasn&rsquo;t anything significant to discuss. Recognition in front of peers works WONDERS! And builds trust, respect, and appreciation for the supervisor,&rdquo; said Liz (@lovelycreationz).</p><p> To create an in-house atmosphere, meetings should be conducted via video. Why? Because seeing faces will cultivate emotion among the team for one another, makes everyone stay focused on the meeting, makes it easier to share ideas and information without cutting one another off, and keeps frustration to a minimum.</p><p> Even though everyone won&rsquo;t always look nice or have the best background setting, it&rsquo;s important to find ways to remind one another we are a team, and we&rsquo;re comprised of real people.</p><h3> 6. Have employees participate in the process.</h3><p> <br/> When people feel like their opinion matters, it will turn the tide of what you get out of them almost immediately.</p><p> &ldquo;Have everyone share their work goals and how they are progressing. Share successes and failures with the group. The group must become vulnerable and transparent with each other to become a cohesive group. When they feel they can freely share where they need help, then others will immediately step in to help them. This breeds an amazing sense of team and not siloed individuals,&rdquo; says Michael Abrams (@michaeltabrams).</p><p> During weekly meetings, ARCH team members are given a chance to air any questions or concerns. In addition, they are constantly asked for their opinions on projects and ideas. My team knows that while I have the ultimate say, their opinion is VERY important to me, even if I disagree.</p><p> Allowing disagreement has been one of the hardest things for me to deal with as a manager because my ego doesn&rsquo;t like to be questioned, haha. But I know it&rsquo;s an important element in developing a healthy atmosphere for the team. And now I&rsquo;m much better at dealing with it.</p><p> &ldquo;We use the term RAZZLE DAZZLE when we&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed (usually with work stuff) and desperately want a time out! We have LOTS of other fun code words that makes working remotely fun and helps us stay connected,&rdquo; shared Shanon Whiteswan (@ShanonWhiteswan).</p><p> Bottom line, we will NEVER get someone&rsquo;s best when they don&rsquo;t feel necessary or needed, and when they can&rsquo;t be honest. It&rsquo;s just not possible.</p><p> When I ask for the best from the team, it means I have to be willing to hear things I don&rsquo;t want to in order to create what I do.</p><h3> 7. Be transparent.</h3><p> <br/> This should be a no-brainer, but isn&rsquo;t. Over the years, I worked with businesses who opened themselves up to their employees, so they could see what was happening. And I worked for those who didn&rsquo;t. The difference in team atmosphere is enormous.</p><p> As Peter Freeman (@peterfreeman) said, &ldquo;Be open and transparent, and build relationships with your people as it&rsquo;s often easier for staff (and bosses) to hide their issues/feelings without the benefit of face to face interaction.&rdquo;</p><p> If you want loyalty and trust, you&rsquo;ve got to earn it. Just because we&rsquo;re managers or business owners doesn&rsquo;t entitle us to anything besides the bare minimum. We have to show our team that we are worth being followed, that we know what we&rsquo;re talking about, lead by example, allow open discussion, and continually be cultivating an environment that brings out the strengths of each individual.</p><p> It is up to us to do the right thing and treat people with respect.</p><h3> Overall:</h3><p> <br/> Everything on this list goes back to healthy communication. If we maintain this priority in all of our decisions, managing a remote team will be an enriching and enjoyable experience.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-30 18:11:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-30 18:11:23.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_3vyslMl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-steps-to-managing-a-remote-team-successfully/\", \"post_id\": \"11424\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-30 18:11:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-30 18:11:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-steps-to-managing-a-remote-team-successfully\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11423\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5577\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/7-Steps-to-Managing-a-Remote-Team-Successfully.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"685\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464721200,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5357,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Important Documents All Clients Should Have in Place","link":"important-documents-all-clients-should-have-in-place","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Most people pride themselves on managing their lives and working hard so that they and their children can have better lives. They&rsquo;re are busy people and choose to rely on professional financial advisors to help increase the value of their assets. &lsquo;Let your money work for you&rsquo; says it all, right? So while the money is working for our clients, there are some major questions to ask on the client&rsquo;s behalf and the all-important accompanying documentation.</p><h3> What exactly are my client&rsquo;s planning needs?</h3><p> <br/> The planning community has had to rethink ideas on planning for aging clients. Planning is no longer based on age alone but the focus has changed to stage of life. Think &ndash; Janet Jackson&hellip; having her first child at 50. Individuals are commonly having children later in life, so schooling and college savings may actually be a priority for an &ldquo;older-ish&rdquo; client.</p><p> Individuals are also more concerned with aging in place, so paying a mortgage or having a reverse mortgage may be important for aging clients who are upgrading instead of downgrading their homes.</p><p> More traditional clients may be still be focused on investing for retirement &ndash; now retiring at a younger age &ndash; or they may focus planning on providing for future generations.</p><p> The client&rsquo;s focus could be on any of these scenarios, but when a serious illness occurs it impacts their planning needs and changes the focus toward paying for long term care.</p><h3> Generally what are the basic documents clients should have in place?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Last Will and Testament: </strong>  It is startling that as many as half of all adults do not have this most fundamental document in place when they die. Think &ndash; Prince&hellip;.$300 million in assets with no Will?</p><p> <strong>  Durable Financial Power of Attorney (DFPOA): </strong>  While a Will determines what happens to the estate after death, a DFPOA controls how business and finances are handled while the client is alive &ndash; either at their direction or when they become incapacitated.</p><p> <strong>  Durable Advance Directive for Health Care (DADHC): </strong>  Is similar to the DFPOA in purpose, but its focus is health care decision making. This is the most personal document as it directs the client&rsquo;s agent as to the physical care and the quality of life they desire.</p><h3> Are there other documents for clients to consider having in place?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Health Records </strong>  &mdash; Courtesy of the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/\" target=\"_blank\">  HIPAA </a> ) and the interpretation of the law by doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, it is difficult for family members to obtain information or medical records unless the provider has a signed HIPAA Authorization and Consent in hand.</p><p> <strong>  Deeds </strong>  &mdash; With or without Right of Survivorship depending on the desired purpose of the document and the planning needs dictated by the client&rsquo;s circumstances.</p><p> <strong>  Trusts  </strong> &mdash; These come in many forms to achieve many different purposes depending on the desired purpose of the document according to the planning needs dictated by the circumstances surrounding the client&rsquo;s situation. They are either Revocable or Irrevocable and might be called Spendthrift Trust; Settlement Protection Trust; Special Needs Trust &ndash; First Party or Third Party; Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust; Education Trust; or Bypass Trust, to name a few.</p><p> While this is obviously not an exhaustive list of documents that may benefit a client, it&rsquo;s the key ones that clients ask about most often. And when it comes to documents, it isn&rsquo;t all in the name:</p><li> For example, even if the Power of Attorney has &ldquo;Durable&rdquo; in the name it is not a Durable Power of Attorney unless the document contains the specific language to make it Durable.</li><li> A Last Will and Testament has state-specific legal requirements it must meet in order to be a legally enforceable document in that jurisdiction.</li><li> A Special Needs Trust must include required language, without which the client&rsquo;s state Medicaid Agency will not approve the document for use as a Special Needs Trust.</li><h3> <br/> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to documents, their creation, intended purpose, and use, it&rsquo;s best to defer to an experienced, knowledgeable practitioner to ensure the client reaches their intended planning goal.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 13:33:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 13:33:58.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_wFSfhTs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/important-documents-all-clients-should-have-in-place/\", \"post_id\": \"11425\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 13:33:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 13:33:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"important-documents-all-clients-should-have-in-place\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11426\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5578\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Important-Documents-All-Clients-Should-Have-in-Place.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"562\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464778800,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5358,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Senior Clients Need More Income? This Hidden Treasure May Be the Solution","link":"senior-clients-need-more-income-this-hidden-treasure-may-be-the-solution","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In 2011, a man arrived at the Tulsa Convention Center in Oklahoma with five carved cups to see how much they might be worth. Whether they&rsquo;d been hidden away in his grandmother&rsquo;s attic for decades or on proud display for decades, no one knows. But that Saturday morning, he was quite surprised to learn that the set, made from rhinoceros horn, was valued at more than $1 million, the highest evaluation in the history of PBS&rsquo;s &ldquo;Antiques Roadshow.&rdquo; If only we could all be so lucky!</p><p> As an advisor, your goal is to help every one of your clients achieve their financial goals. While that rarely (if ever) includes sifting through old attic treasures, you have a handful of strategies and a variety of assets to help your clients grow their nest eggs to support a long, happy, and (hopefully) well-funded retirement. But with traditional retirement now lasting as many as 20 to 30 years, that&rsquo;s not an easy task. Especially as baby boomers enter a highly publicized retirement crisis.</p><p> Medical costs are skyrocketing. Long-term care expenses have the potential to quickly crush anyone on a fixed income. And the market has been unpredictable (to put it mildly). So when assets are dwindling&mdash;and there are no carved rhino cups in the attic&mdash;what can you do to help your senior clients make ends meet?</p><p> The good news is that many of your clients are holding a valuable asset that you may not even realize exists. For your clients 65 and older, that asset may have a surprisingly high market value &ndash; a value that is four to ten times more than you or your clients may realize. Even better, your clients may be able to sell that asset today with little to no risk through a highly regulated transaction.</p><h3> What is this hidden treasure? Life insurance.</h3><p> <br/> Whether your client has a Term or non-variable Universal Life policy, if he or she is 65 or older, it&rsquo;s likely that policy is either unwanted or unneeded&mdash;or most likely it&rsquo;s simply unaffordable. To keep up with rising costs of insurance and compensate for increasing life spans, five major insurance companies raised their premiums last year&mdash;some by as much as 100%&mdash;primarily on policies held by seniors. That means seniors are overpaying for policies that don&rsquo;t even fit their current needs. As a result, a shocking 9 out of 10 policyholders are forced to let their policies lapse (a move that is great for the insurance companies and detestable for the consumer) or surrender the policy, giving them only about $10K on a typical $500K policy.</p><p> But there&rsquo;s a much better alternative available&mdash;one that allows your clients to reap the benefits of the full market value of each policy (as much as $100K on that same $500K policy) and enables you to help your clients generate more income to support their changing needs. That alternative is to sell the policy in a Life Settlement. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p><p> When you own real estate, the value of that property usually increases over time. When you no longer need or want your property, you don&rsquo;t go back to the original seller and ask them to buy it back. Instead, you put it on the market to be sure you get the fair market price. If you&rsquo;ve held your property for 20 years or more, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;re going to make a substantial profit on your investment.</p><p> Life insurance policies are much like real estate. Although policies are often seen as a simple monetary contract between a policyholder and a life insurance company, what many people don&rsquo;t realize is that every life insurance policy is a legal property asset,and it can be sold just like a house or any other asset.</p><p> This is great news for seniors. Just at the time when they may need extra funds, selling their policy in the secondary market can provide a valuable return on an insurance investment. That return can used to fund current expenses or be reinvested to generate future income. Either way, it can feel a lot like being told that old painting &ndash; or set of rhino cups &ndash; in the attic is worth a pretty big sum.</p><p> So why aren&rsquo;t Life Settlements a standard tool in every advisors toolbox? In the past, the market wasn&rsquo;t well regulated, and many advisors viewed Life Settlements as risky ventures. But changes in regulations over the past decade have transformed Life Settlements into a highly respectable senior financial services transaction. For the over 90 percent of seniors living in the 42 states with modern life settlement laws, the sale of a life insurance policy is fully regulated, with details, risks, and any broker commissions clearly laid out. With accountability a priority, Life Settlement buyers and brokers are state licensed and all applicable privacy and investor protections are required to be maintained.</p><p> And with a track record of only 5 consumer complaints in the past 5&frac12; years from policy owners who sold their policies, Life Settlements have quickly earned the respect of consumer advocates and public policy makers. Over the past few years, a growing number of states are requiring insurance companies and Medicaid agencies to promote Life Settlements as a tool to help seniors, particularly those in need of resources to pay for long-tern-care expenses.   And, in response to aggressive anti-consumer tactics by insurance companies, the State of Georgia just enacted a law to protect insurance agents who advise and assist their clients with a life settlement.</p><p> Everyone would love to find a hidden fortune&mdash;especially when it&rsquo;s needed to bolster a fixed income and help fund a long retirement, or meet the expected and unexpected costs of health care and long-term care. If you have time on your hands, you may want to help your clients dig around in the attic and head down to Antiques Roadshow when it comes to town. But I&rsquo;d bet my money on the fact you&rsquo;ll find much needed resources in the form of a Life Settlement. It just may be the treasure you&rsquo;ve been looking for.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 13:43:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 13:43:17.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_xdIhuln.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/senior-clients-need-more-income-this-hidden-treasure-may-be-the-solution/\", \"post_id\": \"11428\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 13:43:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 13:43:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"senior-clients-need-more-income-this-hidden-treasure-may-be-the-solution\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11427\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5579\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Senior-Clients-Need-More-Income-This-Hidden-Treasure-May-Be-the-Solution.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"951\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464793200,"author_id":190,"chart_url":""}

This led to more thinking about our humanity, which led to more thinking.</p><p> It seems to me no matter your age, we all appear to be part of a worldwide midlife crisis.</p><p> Everyday, I study the behavior of individuals and companies, and it&rsquo;s a bit head scratching at what we&mdash;as a society&mdash;have become.</p><p> Of course, it won&rsquo;t surprise most; we&rsquo;ve collectively dragged each other well below mediocrity in most aspects related to quality, service, and respect. I can&rsquo;t help but think a temporarily cheated destiny won&rsquo;t let us get away scot-free with this sustained behavior.</p><p> We can kibitz about how technology has made us less interactive or perpetually distracted. But, but if you closely examine behavior on a grander scale, of both individuals and companies, you&rsquo;ll notice the bruises run much deeper.</p><p> While I&rsquo;m still on the subject of things that irritate me, I&rsquo;d also like to take a moment to apologize to those individuals ages (roughly) twenty-two to thirty-six for taking one on the chin. As if your generation alone could put us in this crisis is absurd.</p><p> While many &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; in my and my father&rsquo;s generations would like you to believe we&rsquo;re &ldquo;here&rdquo; because of you, that&rsquo;s simply not true. These claims tends to be accompanied by an unwillingness to look ourselves in the mirror for fear of what we might see. We both know we didn&rsquo;t suddenly wake up in this 2016 because you came out of the womb with a cell phone in your hand.</p><p> I think the world still has and needs more leaders who are willing to right us again. To do that, we need to understand where we are as a society and one by one reverse this course before destiny wakes up.</p><h3> Entitlement vs. Effort</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve become soft. Those hard-working generations understood there were no shortcuts to reward. This concept must be lost somewhere in the rooms filled with participation awards. It would be easier to find it the much smaller rooms with achievement awards.</p><h3> Quick vs. Quality</h3><p> <br/> You might have guessed I&rsquo;d have said quantity, but that would be too good for us right now. I can understand sacrificing quality for quantity in some instances, but we seem to be sacrificing quality andquantity for quick trials we throw away. We start services, products, and companies and ditch them when we don&rsquo;t make progress fast enough. Lack of patience and effort leads to this line of thinking.</p><h3> Short Views vs. Grand Vision</h3><p> <br/> We don&rsquo;t fulfill the vastness of our visions for a few reasons. First, we don&rsquo;t take the time to consider the grand vision because we&rsquo;re distracted by the world&rsquo;s false, by-the-minute &ldquo;emergencies.&rdquo; Toss in an unwillingness to work hard to achieve the vision and lack of patience required to muscle through the challenges and, hey presto, there it is.</p><h3> Dismissal vs. Investment</h3><p> <br/> Investing time, energy, and resources seems to be taboo. Most people would rather quit and most companies would rather quit their people than invest time to work with them, train them, and ensure they realize their grand vision. Today, companies fold quickly, fire employees quickly, and simply dismiss anything not working.</p><h3> Avoidance vs. Confrontation</h3><p> <br/> How often do you remain silent than speak to your spouse, family member, friend, boss, or coworker regarding something troubling? When did we stop sharing feedback with each other? Was it when we started doling out participation awards? Speaking of&hellip;</p><h3> Participation Awards vs. Higher Standard</h3><p> <br/> Instead of working with people to help them achieve a higher standard, we offer them support and gratitude for showing up. I am all for encouragement and appreciation, but we&rsquo;re doing ourselves no favors by bringing the bottom to the middle and the top to the middle. Pretty soon, we&rsquo;ll be so heavy we&rsquo;ll collectively fall to the bottom.</p><h3> Convenience vs. Hard Work</h3><p> <br/> I remember twenty years ago when companies started casual payday Fridays, which turned into casual (every) Fridays. Then they offered casual dress, which turned into jeans and shorts. This was followed by foosball table breaks and where&rsquo;s my free lunch on the days I&rsquo;m not working from home? I&rsquo;m all for modernizing, but these structures are also an enhancer to the convenience mentality run amok.</p><p> Before we can change, we need to know the issues. Let&rsquo;s consider this post a rare opinion piece from me. I know my followers are smart enough to know the first steps they need to take to become leaders who can get us back on the right track!</p><p> As always, I love to hear from you: What are your observations of humanity today?</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 13:55:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 13:55:41.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_ekz0oN4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-the-world-needs-more-leaders-who-are-willing-to-right-us-again/\", \"post_id\": \"11429\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 13:55:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 13:55:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-the-world-needs-more-leaders-who-are-willing-to-right-us-again\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11427\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5580\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Senior-Clients-Need-More-Income-This-Hidden-Treasure-May-Be-the-Solution.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"334\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464782400,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5360,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Be Overwhelmed by Lamenting On \"How Do I Get There?\"","link":"dont-be-overwhelmed-by-lamenting-on-how-do-i-get-there","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if where I am is where I should be.&rdquo;</p><p> This was the essence of the question my friend raised at a recent breakfast meeting we had. She&rsquo;s been both a friend and a client for the past decade or more, and we have always talked comfortably about our industry in general; nuances related to a deal I was working on, or any number of specific questions related to the work I do for her firm. But the conversation at this meal was different than all of the countless ones we&rsquo;ve had before. Different because this time &ndash; when we were done with the polite back and forth about each other&rsquo;s families and work-life balance &ndash; she pivoted to the $64,000 question weighing on her mind. (And, in reality, the $64,000 question on just about everyone&rsquo;s mind&mdash;everyone who is being honest with themselves, anyway.)</p><p> My friend happens to be a very successful career woman and so, in this case, her query had mostly to do with her professional life.</p><p> &ldquo;Is the work I am doing now and the firm at which I do it still serving me best? And, will it continue to do so as I look into the future?&rdquo;</p><p> To tell the truth, I&rsquo;ve asked that very same question dozens of times, referring sometimes only to my career, and more often to the role I play and how I spend my time in my personal life. In fact, when I think back on the conversations I&rsquo;ve had with my&ldquo;personal board of directors&rdquo; (what I call a group of my seven closest friends), it&rsquo;s a question that someone invariably brings up.</p><p> Change, to me, feels exciting. I love the idea of growing and learning new things; being sparked by new challenges and adventures. But, even to someone like me who usually embraces it, I get paralyzed at first by overwhelm&hellip;at even the thought of doing something different in my life. For example, when I first noticed the boredom I was feeling at being a stay-at-home mom all those years ago, I became filled with a knowing deep in my soul that the status quo no longer served me and it was time for a change.</p><p> &ldquo;What could my life look like under new terms and a new direction, with different people and commitments to fill my time?&rdquo;</p><p> That question alone made me feel just short of paralyzed at first, but less so over time as I gained greater clarity around what I wanted my end game to look like. From a desire to work part time &ndash; so that I would never have to miss one of my sons&rsquo; soccer games, performances, or orthodontist appointments, yet still challenge my mind and build something that would make me more whole &ndash; Diamond Consultants was born.</p><h3> The White Space in Between: The &ldquo;Not Knowing&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> So, why is it so hard to make a change if the result is almost always something better than what we have now? It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;not knowing&rdquo;, I think. As a black and white thinker (and admitted major control freak), I need to have everything mapped out and know at all times exactly where I&rsquo;m going and how I will get there. Lack of clarity and structure makes me crazy. But, after 53 years and lots of uncomfortable changes under my belt, I realize that I am not supposed to know everything and that the best things that have happened to me were because I let go and let the universe direct me as I moved through the white space between &ldquo;here&rdquo; and &ldquo;there&rdquo;.</p><p> My business, for example, has grown into something far beyond anything I could have ever imagined. To be sure, I put in a lot of sweat equity over the last 2 decades and I definitely knew what the non-negotiable tenets were in order for me to feel good about what I was doing everyday. But if I had the need to know exactly how I would get from &ldquo;stay-at-home mom&rdquo; to a leading recruiter in the financial services industry, I am quite sure I never could have imagined where I am now&hellip;nor could I even have mapped out how to get here. That&rsquo;s because when I let go of the need to control everything, the universe actually had much better plans for me than I could ever have dreamt of for myself.</p><p> So, back to my friend&hellip;I think about how lucky she is to be gainfully employed by a firm that enables her to make a very nice living and feel good almost every day about the work she does. She knows what things she loves and hates about her job, and what sparks her. Yet, she&rsquo;s looking at the bigger picture and realizing she wants more of the things she loves, and less of those that she hates. It&rsquo;s that &ldquo;spark&rdquo; that she really wants more of&mdash;and acknowledging that is key. From there, she can start to connect the dots: think about what her job would look like if she could have it her way, and if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, then maybe she needs to create it&mdash;at her current firm or elsewhere.</p><p> Whatever your goal, don&rsquo;t be overwhelmed by lamenting on &ldquo;How do I get there?&rdquo; The answer lies in putting one foot in front of the other, one day at a time, and before you know it, the space between here and there &ndash; which initially seemed so vast &ndash; will virtually disappear. Resilience and flexibility will need to be your new best friends as it will take both to get comfortable with the &ldquo;not knowing&rdquo; of exactly how and when you will get there. Keep your focus on knowing that you want to be there and the rest will fall into place.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 14:08:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 14:08:13.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_T5kp0HT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-be-overwhelmed-by-lamenting-on-how-do-i-get-there/\", \"post_id\": \"11430\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 14:08:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 14:08:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-be-overwhelmed-by-lamenting-on-how-do-i-get-there\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11427\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5581\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Senior-Clients-Need-More-Income-This-Hidden-Treasure-May-Be-the-Solution.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"755\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464793200,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

They tend to say some of the same things over and over, such as, &ldquo;I can understand why you would feel that way and we are sorry for your inconvenience.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s as if they are reading from a script&hellip; because most of the time they are. I actually had one customer service representative repeat that phrase so many times that I asked them to not to say it anymore.</p><p> They aren&rsquo;t really sorry. At least they don&rsquo;t appear to be. What they appear to be doing is regurgitating the responses they learned in their customer service training classes or what&rsquo;s printed on a piece of paper. Maybe they really are sincere; but their company forces them to appear to be insincere, because they are required to go by the script.</p><h3> The bottom line is this: You can&rsquo;t script sincerity!</h3><p> <br/> The best customer support people, leaders, co-workers &ndash; really anyone you work with &ndash; don&rsquo;t get to be the best by being fake or insincere. No, they have empathy, concern, and genuinely care about who they work and do business with.</p><p> And, if you can&rsquo;t script sincerity, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to teach it either. If people aren&rsquo;t cut out to be empathetic and caring, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to teach them, at least not before they potentially do damage to the relationship with the customer.</p><p> That said, some people can fake sincerity, at least for a short time. Eventually the effort and pressure to be someone that they&rsquo;re not will catch up with them, and can manifest itself in potentially angry behavior. That&rsquo;s why some employees lose their cool. It&rsquo;s not that these people aren&rsquo;t nice. It&rsquo;s just that their personalities don&rsquo;t have the patience or empathy needed to deal with confrontational customers, especially if they are upset and acting unreasonable.</p><h3> The bottom line is that insincerity is a loyalty killer.</h3><p> <br/> And, while they may put up with it, customers shouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with a  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-care/customers-are-people-not-numbers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  customer support </a>  rep who is scripted, apathetic, and isn&rsquo;t customer focused. How can a customer have a positive emotional connection to the company if the employees come off as fake or insincere?</p><p> So, how do we go about getting good, caring people? It starts before you even hire someone. The leadership has to define what good customer service looks like in the organization. Once defined, you hire good people who can support that initiative.

Moving around the world, working for a new company, buying a home and having a baby are exciting and joyful occasions. However, there are those times when change and choice are not in the same sentence. Life feels remarkably out of your control. Then what?</p><p> This week my life was disrupted, and the ripples are becoming not so gentle waves impacting my business, family, and day-to-day attitude. Not acceptable. However, I know I&rsquo;m not alone. I&rsquo;ll bet you have some sh*t going on in your life that&rsquo;s creating waves as well.</p><p> For years, out of control change was one of the drivers for people to reach out to me for coaching. It&rsquo;s nice to think that everyone is proactively creating their future with a coach but in truth, it&rsquo;s often crisis that leads to action. </p><p> I&rsquo;m never a fan of overused platitudes but I agree, &ldquo;the best way out is always through.&rdquo; Thanks, Robert Frost. I know it stinks to hear it when you&rsquo;re in the midst of change that&rsquo;s out of your control, but there is an &ldquo;other side.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll get there.</p><p> Sound familiar?&hellip;</p><h3> Forced From Comfort to Crazy</h3><p> <br/> Life is good. Comfortable enough that you regularly dare yourself to stretch and take risks. Then IT happens.</p><p> No need for me to write what your IT is, you know IT. You&rsquo;re blindsided, stressed and unsure of what to do next. Options abound yet none of them sound good. You try your hardest to wake up from your bad dream and don&rsquo;t want to accept that this is your life, and it&rsquo;s time to deal with IT.</p><p> Chances are, you know that panicking is not a part of the solution, but it&rsquo;s where most people start when  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/change-in-the-rules-learn-to-shift-and-thrive/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  unexpected change </a>  hits their life. I&rsquo;ll be the first to raise my hand and admit that I&rsquo;m right there with you.</p><p> Which road you take when change is out of your control is like living a Choose Your Own Adventure novel. Some of the paths in front of you lead to a terrible dead end and others to a much more satisfying conclusion.  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/change-life-change-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The beauty of a Choose Your Own Adventure novel  </a> is that if you don&rsquo;t like the ending, you can go back and start over. The same applies to how you react and respond to unwanted change.</p><p> Which road do you choose to follow when change is out of your control?</p><h3> Three Paths When Life Takes You from Comfort to Crazy</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve been working in change management since the early 1990&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ve seen three consistent paths emerge when change strikes. In fact, many people meander down all three until making it out the other side.</p><h3> <strong>  1) Ask Everyone You Know What To Do </strong></h3><p> <br/> Usually, before the ask, this path also includes some whining and moaning about how horrible the situation is. Truthfully, complaining is okay as long as you keep it time bound. If you never leave the woe is me stage, no amount of advice seeking and wisdom gathering is going to help.</p><p> Pitfalls:</p><li> Energy wasted on commiserating takes away energy from overcoming and <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/4-ways-to-overcome-indecision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  stepping forward into what&rsquo;s next. </a></li><li> Everyone has a course of action that&rsquo;s opposite of what you&rsquo;re gut is telling you. Oh no!</li><li> Letting someone else determine your fate. <br/>  </li><p> Strengths:</p><li> When you feel lost, aren&rsquo;t you supposed to ask for directions?</li><li> People who have been in a similar circumstance can share their experience.</li><li> You won&rsquo;t feel alone in your misery. <br/>  </li><p> Reality:</p><p> Asking for input is a smart move to ensure you&rsquo;re considering all of your options. However, you still need to choose another path to continue your journey; it doesn&rsquo;t end here. Keep moving to path #3 &ndash; one of action, commitment and embracing the unknown. It&rsquo;s tempting to ask forever and pretend that IT will simply go away, but it won&rsquo;t.</p><h3> <strong>  2) Retreat and Hide </strong></h3><p> <br/> When IT strikes and something is out of your control, it&rsquo;s tempting to run away. We&rsquo;ve all read stories of sailors who would go beneath the deck to ride out the storm but it&rsquo;s a mirage of safety. In actuality, it puts them at the mercy of the storm. When you hide from inevitable change, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s out of your control, it doesn&rsquo;t stop it and may, in fact, put you in harms way.</p><p> Pitfalls:</p><li> Hiding gives away all of your remaining power. You are not powerless.</li><li> Wallowing is painful and stress-inducing.</li><li> There are some changes that you can&rsquo;t wait out. This is one of them. <br/>  </li><p> Strengths:</p><li> When you&rsquo;re alone, it gives you time to gather your thoughts and composure.</li><li> You can tap into your inner knower without a lot of outside noise.</li><li> No hasty moves, you&rsquo;re busy hiding. <br/>  </li><p> Reality:</p><p> Retreating does not have to be the same as doing everything you can to hide from the change (which is impossible.)  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/learn-to-be-alone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Use your retreat to gain perspective </a>  and begin to formulate a plan forward. PS. Your change journey doesn&rsquo;t end here either. It&rsquo;s time for you to step down path #1 or (hopefully) #3.</p><h3> <strong>  3) Move Through Anger, Sadness, and Frustration to Productivity </strong></h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;ve made it here, the final chapter. It&rsquo;s one filled with action and empowerment instead of victimhood. You may still be angry and disrupted, but you&rsquo;re in control of what happens next. Weigh your options and start moving forward. You&rsquo;re done with the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; cycle and are entering the &ldquo;I choose&rdquo; phase.</p><p> Pitfalls:</p><li> You may be unsure of what to do.</li><li> You may choose a less than ideal path forward.</li><li> You don&rsquo;t love where you land. <br/>  </li><p> Strengths:</p><li> You refuse to be at the mercy of the wind and are taking a proactive approach &ndash; kicking in your personal leadership!</li><li> As you act, you&rsquo;ll get to see and experience the impact of your decisions. You&rsquo;re moving forward &ndash; no wallowing.</li><li> If you&rsquo;re not happy or satisfied with what&rsquo;s next, you can  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/choices-create-legacy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  make another choice. You are in control. </a> <br/>  </li><p> Reality:</p><p> This is the only path through to the other side of the change. Standing still won&rsquo;t get you anywhere. Make a choice and go with it even when there&rsquo;s no perfect solution. Don&rsquo;t forget, every place you move will open up new possibilities.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re feeling paralyzed and don&rsquo;t know what to do next, check out my eCourse Get Unstuck and Choose to Move.

{"original_id":5364,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What to Do If You've Been Named as Trustee","link":"what-to-do-if-youve-been-named-as-trustee","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Something has happened. Your dinnerware set finally matches, you&rsquo;ve graduated from box wine to bottles, you&rsquo;re making your own dentist appointments and, despite your best efforts, you have started to channel your mother.  You have become an adult. Just when you think you&rsquo;ve got adulting down, you learn that someone has named you as trustee of their trust. Gulp. Among everyone they know, they think YOU are responsible enough to make sure their money or property does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do if they can&rsquo;t be in control. Before regretting every responsible decision you&rsquo;ve made, remember that it&rsquo;s an honor to be chosen as trustee. It&rsquo;s also a moral and legal responsibility, so, here are some tips to make sure you are up for the task. </p><h3> Ask When? </h3><p> <br/> In most cases, your responsibility as trustee won&rsquo;t start today, but rather at some future time as a backup. The most common type of trust is a revocable living trust which controls how an individual or couple&rsquo;s property is used for their lifetimes and how it&rsquo;s passed to loved ones after they die - cue you as the &ldquo;successor trustee.&rdquo; Your role is to take over the control and disposition of property if the trust creators die or become incapacitated.  If the trust is an irrevocable trust instead, your responsibilities as trustee may start immediately or again at a later time as a successor trustee. </p><h3> Ask Why?</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;re likely being asked to manage and distribute assets to your friend or family member if something happens to them and to distribute property to care for their children or other loved ones. If the trust is irrevocable, it more likely has a specific purpose for its creation, such as providing for education or benefits to someone with special needs. It&rsquo;s not asking too much to want to know generally who the trust benefits and the primary purpose of the trust. If you&rsquo;re being asked to serve immediately, this is clearly an area where you should feel free to ask any questions.</p><h3> Ask What?</h3><p> <br/> As trustee, it&rsquo;s important to know what assets the trust controls.Odds are, if the trust is a living trust, it controls your friend/family member&rsquo;s home, investments and life insurance, but it could also own an interest in a business or rental real estate. Trust assets change over time, so if you&rsquo;re a successor (future) trustee, you might just ask if there&rsquo;s anything you should know about what property the trust holds now. If you&rsquo;re being asked to serve as trustee immediately, you&rsquo;ll definitely need to know exactly what the trust will own since you will be legally responsible to manage those assets.</p><h3> Ask Where?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re a successor trustee, you should minimally know where to get a copy of the trust, should something happen to the current acting trustee. If you&rsquo;re being asked to serve immediately, you&rsquo;ll need a copy of the trust now, as the trust document is your written instruction on how to manage and distribute assets to beneficiaries.  </p><h3> Grab Your Sticky Notes.</h3><p> <br/> There will be a lot of legalese in the trust, but there is also clear language, so get out your sticky notes and dig in. You can and should ask the estate attorney to explain anything you don&rsquo;t understand.  You should also take some time to read articles or a book about what it means to be a trustee and consider reading our piece, So You&rsquo;ve Been Named as Trustee. </p><h3> Get Serious and Seek Help. </h3><p> <br/> As a trustee you are held to a fiduciary standard of care. That means you&rsquo;ll need to put the beneficiaries&rsquo; needs above your own, treat beneficiaries fairly, protect and invest the trust assets prudently, and keep records and file tax returns. The trust will likely allow you to use assets to pay for professional help. Most trustees work with an accountant, estate attorney and an investment advisor.   </p><h3> Know Your Options.  </h3><p> <br/> You don&rsquo;t have to be a lawyer or a financial wizard to be a trustee, and your friend or family wouldn&rsquo;t have named you as trustee if they didn&rsquo;t think you were up to the task. It is a big responsibility, though, so if you aren&rsquo;t comfortable, you can decline the position. If you are comfortable but worry that your sentiment may change as life changes, know that you can later decline to serve or resign in the future.  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 16:42:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 16:42:02.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_N04i6S6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-to-do-if-youve-been-named-as-trustee/\", \"post_id\": \"11438\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 16:42:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 16:42:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-to-do-if-youve-been-named-as-trustee\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11437\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5585\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-to-Do-If-Youve-Been-Named-as-Trustee.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"827\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464786000,"author_id":479,"chart_url":""}

Using technology can streamline your operations work, enhance your client experience, and ultimately help you sign more prospects. But there are +100 advisor-focused technology solutions on the market! Considering which technology to invest in can be a daunting task.This is why we here at Bridge have compiled our top-five most important technology solutions for advisors.But before we get to our top tech-picks, it&rsquo;s important to cover some tips on how to pick great technology for your firm.<h3> Signs You Should Implement New Technology in Your Firm</h3>Here are some signs it may be time to implement new technology in your firm:<li> You feel that you&rsquo;re spending too much time on menial tasks like entering data, organizing files, generating reports, finding contact information, etc.</li><li> You think your time could be better spent on something else, such as prospecting or meeting with current clients.</li><li> You find it difficult to complete everything you need to get done each day.</li><li> You currently have a technology solution, but you avoid using it because it&rsquo;s difficult to navigate and/or outdated.</li><h3> What to Look For In a Technology Solution for Advisors</h3>ScalabilityWhen addressing scalability, you should ask yourself: can this product grow with my business as I take on additional clients? Ideally, you want a tech solution that works well for you now, but that will also serve an important role once you&rsquo;ve grown your firm&rsquo;s client base. Some questions to consider include:<li> Is this solution innovating at the same pace I plan to grow my business at?</li><li> Does this solution integrate with other technologies I use and/or plan to use in the future?</li><li> Does this solution provide cloud-based data storage for increased flexibility?</li><li> Is this system user-friendly enough for my current and potential future employees?</li><li> How quickly and easily can I get this new system up-and-running?</li>ServiceAsk yourself: is there technical support if I need it? Technical support should be a key consideration in implementing any technology solution. Most likely you will not have a team member dedicated to implementing and managing this new solution. This means ensuring that the product you&rsquo;re considering provides a smooth onboarding process and adequate training for your employees is important. You&rsquo;ll also want to make sure that the solution you&rsquo;re considering provides continued service support after the onboarding process is complete. Great quality technology has equally great technical support to back it up!InterfaceNext, it&rsquo;s important to consider if the product&rsquo;s interface is easy to navigate. No one wants to spend extra time navigating a clunky, confusing interface. Luckily, advisor tech solutions nowadays have come a long way, and many options (including all of our top-picks), include a simple, easy-to-use interface.Cost/BenefitFinally, consider how this piece of technology can help your firm reach long-term goals. All premium technology solutions come at a price, but each solution has the capacity to add value to your business by increasing efficiency. Some questions to consider include:<li> What are my goals for my firm, both long-term and short-term?</li><li> What are some inefficient areas of my firm?</li><li> Will this solution help my firm become more efficient?</li><li> How does the cost of this solution fit into my overall budget? Will implementing this solution reduce costs in another area?</li><li> What is the opportunity cost to me if I choose not to invest in this solution?</li><h3> 5 Technology Tools Every Advisor Should be Using</h3><h3> <strong>  Back-Office Solution: Atlas/X </strong></h3><a href=\"http://www.bridgeft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Atlas/X</a> is an automated solution for many of the back-office tasks that advisors waste countless hours a week on such as billing, performing reporting, and account management.Major pain-points Atlas/X addresses:<p> Generating performance reports</p><li> Executing trades</li><li> Rebalancing accounts</li><li> Monitoring drift</li><li> Billing clients</li>Features:<p> Automatic drift alerts</p><li> One-click rebalancing</li><li> On-demand billing</li><li> Customizable performance reports</li><li> Streamlined account-opening process</li><li> File-sharing</li><li> Client portal</li><h3> <strong>  CRM: Base </strong></h3><a href=\"https://getbase.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Base</a> is a customer relationship management software which focuses on providing you the tools you need to streamline your sales process, all within an easy-to-navigate interface.<p> Major pain-points Base addresses:</p><li> Managing contacts</li><li> Importing contact information</li><li> Monitoring the sales cycle</li>Features:<li> Importing contact information from a variety of file types</li><li> Customizable sales cycle</li><li> Analytics on sales performance</li><li> Coordinated iPhone app to easily track and record calls with prospects</li><h3> <strong>  Client Management: Oranj </strong></h3><a href=\"http://www.runoranj.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Oranj</a> gives you the tools you need to more efficiently manage your current clients, and convert more prospects into clients.

I told him I was a sales trainer (this is the easiest answer as for some reason as soon as I add &ldquo;inside sales&rdquo; to anyone out of the industry, they have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about). </p><p> He immediately made the mistake that most companies and managers and even sales reps make when he next said, &ldquo;Product knowledge is what it&rsquo;s all about.  You have to know your products.&rdquo;</p><p> When I corrected him by saying product knowledge takes second place to qualifying a prospect and discovering unique buying motives, he seemed genuinely confused.  I explained: &ldquo;Most companies spend hours, days and even weeks training their sales reps on each product and service, and then about a day (or a couple of hours) on how to sell them.  This results in a knowledgeable sales team that is quick to list features and benefits until the cows come home.  This creates a lot of conversations, but not a lot of sales.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What should they be doing?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p> And that&rsquo;s when I asked him how he would go about selling me a pencil. </p><p> He thought about it for a while and then launched into &ndash; you bet &ndash; a list of features and benefits about a pencil. </p><p> I let him go on for a while until he was out of ideas (you can only talk about the color yellow and the use of an eraser for so long), and then I asked him: &ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t even use pencils?&rdquo; </p><p> That stumped him.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s the whole point.  Most sales reps sell just like he does: leading with features and benefits sure that if they just say the right one or ones, in the right order or combination, then prospects will eventually see some value and say, &ldquo;Ah!  I&rsquo;ve got to have that!  Thank you so much for calling!&rdquo;</p><p> As Dr. Phil would say, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that working out for you?&rdquo;</p><p> The proper way to sell a pencil &ndash; and your product or service &ndash; is to first qualify for need and unique buying motives, and then match up the appropriate features and benefits to fit those defined needs. </p><p> So using the &ldquo;how to sell a pencil&rdquo; analogy, it doesn&rsquo;t begin by pitching the attributes of a pencil, rather, it starts by uncovering the need for one (or for a thousand).  It begins with a series of questions like:</p><p> &ldquo;How do you use pencils in your facilities?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How many pencils do you go through in a month?  A year?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Who orders the pencils?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s important to you in a pencil?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How many pencils do you usually order at a time?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Where do you get your pencils from now?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Why do you get them there?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;When was the last time you compared suppliers of pencils?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;If you were to change suppliers, what would be important for you in the next vendor?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Besides yourself, who makes the decision to order pencils?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How about in your other facilities?&rdquo;</p><p> And on and on&hellip;  Now, I can just hear some of you thinking, &ldquo;But Mike, a prospect isn&rsquo;t going to sit still for all these questions!&rdquo;  Well, maybe yes, maybe no.  I&rsquo;ll tell you now, non-buyers won&rsquo;t sit still, but most buyers will.  And that&rsquo;s a clue as to who might buy from you and who won&rsquo;t.</p><p> The bottom line is that you can&rsquo;t sell without knowing if there is a need and interest.  And if you get some of the answers above, then you&rsquo;ll know exactly how to pitch and how to sell. </p><p> If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll just go through your list of features and benefits and when you get to the end, you&rsquo;ll cross your fingers and hope someone buys. </p><p> I don&rsquo;t know about you &ndash; but that&rsquo;s a horrible way to make your way through life in sales.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 17:16:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 17:16:34.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_x0LpiSU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/features-and-benefits-versus-knowing-how-to-sell/\", \"post_id\": \"11442\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 17:16:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 17:16:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"features-and-benefits-versus-knowing-how-to-sell\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11441\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5587\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Features-and-Benefits-Versus-Knowing-How-to-Sell.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"597\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464768000,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5367,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What You Can Learn From Positive Feedback","link":"what-you-can-learn-from-positive-feedback","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Receiving positive feedback may seem straightforward; isn&rsquo;t being recognized for your efforts always a good thing? However, some people may have a harder time than others accepting praise. You may be constantly striving for perfection and focused on what you perceive as holes and flaws in your performance, however small. Being the center of attention may make you feel uncomfortable and encourage you to downplay your performance. Alternatively, you may accept recognition as a sign that you have reached your peak performance, leading you to stop exercising and improving your strengths. These tips will help you accept recognition appropriately, while gathering valuable information to help identify and enhance your strengths.</p><h3> Why is it important to learn how to accept positive feedback well?</h3><p> <br/> Positive feedback is not just a compliment on a job well done, when analyzed correctly it can help you identify your strengths. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joefolkman/2014/01/30/in-2014-are-you-fixing-your-weakness-or-building-your-strength-heres-what-matters-most/\" target=\"_blank\">   Research </a>  by Zenger Folkman has revealed that 70-80% of employees and leaders reap greater benefits from improving their strengths versus weaknesses. Knowing what your strengths are can be the first step in taking your career to the next level.</p><p> Even if you believe you already know what your strengths are, they may differ from how your manager perceives your performance. Good managers utilize their employees&rsquo; strengths by giving them tasks they feel will be best suited to their skill set and providing opportunities for growth. Analyzing the positive feedback your manager gives you will help you to better understand what assignments you may expect in the future and what career track you are heading towards. If you&rsquo;re happy with the direction you&rsquo;re heading in that&rsquo;s great, but if your career track is different from what you envision yourself doing down the line it&rsquo;s important to speak up and make adjustments.  </p><p> For example, you may be excellent at analyzing data and making spreadsheets but you may secretly find it tedious or feel working in sales will provide more potential for upward mobility. If you don&rsquo;t voice a desire to try new things you will continue getting work that plays to what others believe are your main strengths.</p><h3> Follow these steps to help you receive positive feedback the right way:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Accept your positive feedback</h3><p> <br/> Fight the urge to downplay or pick at your performance. Many people have a natural tendency to deflect or dilute a compliment. Though you may feel you&rsquo;re merely being humble, these tactics will make it seem like you&rsquo;re not confident in your abilities. Learning how to accept positive feedback may actually boost your self-confidence.</p><p> Even if you didn&rsquo;t quite reach your target or land your next big client, look at it as the next step in the development of this particular strength. A near win can be an even more powerful motivator than an outright victory if you maintain focus.</p><h3> 2. How to respond</h3><p> <br/> The best response is to accept your feedback and thank the reviewer. If you&rsquo;re still worried about sounding overly confident, remember that you achieved this goal through the hard work you put into it. For example, when someone gives you positive feedback on your social media campaign, try simply saying &ldquo;thank you, I put in extra time to learn how to use a new social media platform and I feel it really helped.&rdquo; Embrace your feedback by acknowledging your hard work.</p><p> Rather than diluting positive feedback with excuses, share it with others. It&rsquo;s important to recognize co-workers who helped you achieve this success. For example, &ldquo;Christina taught me how to use a new hosting platform and I feel this greatly contributed to the success of our new blog.&rdquo; Acknowledging the contribution of your co-workers shows your appreciation towards the team and takes the pressure off.</p><h3> 3. Extract important information</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not enough to be able to accept positive feedback well, you also need to learn how to use it to your advantage. Think about what exactly your manager or colleague liked about your performance, can you come up with ways to replicate or use this tactic more often?</p><p> If not you may need to press for further information. If your manager says you did a &ldquo;great job&rdquo; on the report you wrote, ask what they liked about it. Getting them to give you examples is especially helpful. If your manager tells you they liked the formatting, readability or graphs you&rsquo;ll have a good idea of the style you should use in the future.</p><p> If you really feel you need some tips you can also press for more constructive feedback by asking open-ended questions such as, &ldquo;What do you think I could do differently next time?&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Discuss how you can keep improving</h3><p> <br/> Now that you&rsquo;ve learned your strengths, don&rsquo;t make the mistake of becoming so confident in your abilities that you fail to keep pushing yourself to improve. Remember there will always be room for improvement and take advantage of the knowledge you now have.</p><p> Most people work best when they have a plan and set goals for themselves. If the feedback is coming from your manager, take advantage of your one-on-one meeting by asking for more challenging assignments or responsibilities to meet these goals. Asking if you can manage the next project, take the lead on the next sales pitch or be given a stretch assignment are all good ways to challenge yourself.</p><p> Use your strengths to mentor younger employees or others who have difficulty in this area. Give positive feedback and encourage others to do the same</p><h3> Summary and take-aways:</h3><p> <br/> Even after a job well done, some people may still have trouble accepting positive feedback. Learning how to analyze success factors will help you identify and leverage your strengths to advance your career in the right direction.</p><li> Fight the urge to downplay your achievements</li><li> Recognize your hard work and others who helped you succeed</li><li> Analyze feedback to learn your strengths</li><li> Use these strengths to continue improving and help others</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 17:51:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 17:51:07.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_TknY4Hq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-you-can-learn-from-positive-feedback/\", \"post_id\": \"11443\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 17:51:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 17:51:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-you-can-learn-from-positive-feedback\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11444\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5589\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-You-Can-Learn-From-Positive-Feedback.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"531\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464804000,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5368,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Quick and Simple Tips for Effective Design","link":"4-quick-and-simple-tips-for-effective-design","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When you think of design, you probably think of visuals &mdash; logos, colors, perhaps shapes.</p><p> Design does incorporate visuals, but if that&rsquo;s all you think it is, you&rsquo;re missing out on a huge opportunity as an entrepreneur. Design is something that every human is capable of. It&rsquo;s a visible and invisible universal language that communicates the quality of an experience.</p><p> Designers see the world as pliable &mdash; we can shape it to meet our needs and drive innovation. If you begin a new venture without focusing on design, you are taking the human experience element out of the equation. But that could be a costly mistake, as business is all about humans.</p><p> Luckily, applying design thinking to your venture doesn&rsquo;t require a special set of skills or 10,000 hours of practice. You just need to take these four steps:</p><h3> 1. Tell a Story</h3><p> <br/> Futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil defines storytelling as the first technology. It&rsquo;s how you start a company, build a brand, and deliver a product. In fact, great storytelling will forge an emotional bond between you and your audience. This is critical when attempting to convince someone that your company is smarter, better, or different than the competition. So don&rsquo;t merely sell your product or service. Make it an experience.</p><p> Apple isn&rsquo;t Apple because it sells electronics. After all, RadioShack, Best Buy, and Circuit City all did that before Apple. Apple is Apple because it tells an irresistible story. People want to be a part of what the company does. Nike is another company that does an excellent job of this. It empowers consumers to join a team and invites them to be part of the story.</p><h3> 2. Use Visual Aids</h3><p> <br/> Start building the visual side of your brand from day one. Once you&rsquo;ve identified your story, you&rsquo;ll begin to see the underlying metaphors that describe your value and make you unique. Creating a visual version of your model will introduce you to additional ways to tell your story. Map your business model on a whiteboard, and let the ideas and thoughts flow.</p><h3> 3. Delay Solutions</h3><p> <br/> Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions. Always take a step back, frame your opportunities, and weigh your options before you solve a problem. Being analytical pushes the envelope of creativity and innovation. Your audience will notice this.</p><h3> 4. Ask Yourself, &ldquo;How Might We?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Use this powerful paradigm to reframe your challenges. Asking this question transforms a problem into an opportunity and opens the door to endless possibilities. Viewing your challenges as opportunities breeds positivity and productivity.</p><p> As an entrepreneur, it pays to be design-minded with everything you do. It&rsquo;s crucial to staying ahead of the curve, attracting clients and customers, and telling the story of your greatness.  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 18:01:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 18:01:26.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_U1uYvSd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-quick-and-simple-tips-for-effective-design/\", \"post_id\": \"11446\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 18:01:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 18:01:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-quick-and-simple-tips-for-effective-design\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11445\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5590\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4-Quick-and-Simple-Tips-for-Effective-Design.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"878\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464800400,"author_id":436,"chart_url":""}

The plan administrator has a say in how you invest and how you can withdraw assets.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re 59 1/2 or older you can withdraw funds from your 401k without tax penalty. Under some circumstances you can withdraw a lump sum penalty free if you&rsquo;re over 55. Note, you&rsquo;re avoiding penalties, not ordinary income taxes. The penalty for early withdrawal is 10% of the amount withdrawn.</p><p> Some retirees want to delay taking withdrawals as long as possible. Mainly to help their savings compound without the negative effect of taxes. Generally it makes sense to delay taxes.</p><p> Beginning the year you turn 70 1/2 you must begin taking minimum distributions. The amount is related to your life expectancy. Your plan administrator can provide you with the IRS table. To get a rough estimate of your required distribution divide 1 by the number of years of your life expectancy. Then multiply that by the value of the assets in the 401k plan.</p><p> Once you retire, most  <a href=\"http://www.kjhfinancialservices.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial advisors </a>  will recommend that you take your money out of the  <a href=\"https://kjhfinancialservices.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/retirement-options-for-your-401k/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  401k </a>  plan. Either as a one time distribution or as a rollover into an IRA account. The reason is to avoid plan fees and to give you greater flexibility in investing your funds.</p><p> If you decide to keep your funds within the 401k plan you&rsquo;ll need to adhere to their rules. Those rules will affect both your options for distribution and your investment choices. Check with your plan administrator to find out how to withdraw funds. Most will allow you to make periodic or regularly scheduled withdrawals. There may also be rules regarding when and how often you can change your distribution options. Some also have rules regarding minimum distributions.</p><p> As mentioned, withdrawals will be added to your taxable income unless they&rsquo;re rolled over into a qualifying IRA.</p><p> For many retirees, rolling into an IRA is their best choice. You&rsquo;ll have lower fees, more investment choices, similar distribution rules and still be compounding tax-free.</p><p> If you plan on taking your distribution in cash, you&rsquo;ll need to do some tax planning. Taking a regular distribution will allow you to spread the taxes and keep you in the lower tax brackets. Taking a lump sum distribution could throw you into a tax bracket designed for the wealthy. Your distribution will also be reduced by a 20% withholding which you can apply to your next year&rsquo;s tax bill.</p><p> A popular option is to take part or all of your funds in a distribution and purchase an annuity. There are various types of annuities. Retirees prefer ones that provide a guaranteed lifetime income. Proponents point out that with an annuity you can&rsquo;t outlive your money. But you should recognize that not all annuities are indexed for inflation. Your monthly guarantee might look good today, but buy much less in 20 years if prices rise (and it&rsquo;s likely they will).</p><p> No one choice is best for everyone. This might be the time to get some professional advice. The decision you make is the culmination of years of saving and will affect your finances for the rest of your life.</p><p> There are many variables to consider. How much you&rsquo;ve  <a href=\"https://kjhfinancialservices.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/smart-investing-at-any-age/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  saved </a> . Your investment philosophy. Your income needs. Your expected longevity. Your tax situation. Even your children&rsquo;s financial situation can affect your decision.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-05-31 18:08:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-05-31 18:08:09.000000","image_url":"2016/5/article_placeholder_HGKv0nD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-handle-401k-distributions/\", \"post_id\": \"11448\", \"post_date\": \"2016-05-31 18:08:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-05-31 18:08:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-handle-401k-distributions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11447\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5591\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/How-To-Handle-401k-Distributions.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1032\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464796800,"author_id":282,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5370,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Questions to Ask After a Job Phone Interview","link":"10-questions-to-ask-after-a-job-phone-interview","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Phone interviews are often used by Human Resources and Sales managers to learn a little more about the candidate and ask a few questions before offering a formal sit down interview. Phone interviews are usually only used for first round interviews to qualify candidates, but can also be conducted as second round interviews as well. Your typical phone interview will be under half an hour. </p><p> Your phone interview is more than likely your first actual real contact with the company and while you can&rsquo;t physically shake your interviewers hand, you can still make a great impact over the phone. </p><p> Once you have arranged a phone interview with your prospective employer, it is crucial to do your research! Check out this guide to interview prep in under 30 minutes. Once you&rsquo;ve done your initial prep you can begin to get more granular. The big plus about having a phone interview is that it allows you to have all of your notes right in front of you. The phone also lifts a bit of the pressure and it is less likely you&rsquo;ll totally blank and forget your answers on the spot.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve aced the interview and answered all their questions it may be tempting to blurt out a quick &ldquo;OK BYE,&rdquo; but there is one more thing left to do. It is crucial you ask  your interviewer a few questions about the company and position to show your interest in the job. Phone interviews are usually only set for 15 &ndash; 30 minutes, so there is limited time to ask questions. Your questions need to be relevant to the position and straight to the point.</p><h3> Here are 10 great questions to ask your interviewer at the end of your phone interview.</h3><h3> <br/> 1. In your opinion, what is the most challenging part of this position? </h3><p> <br/> This shows you are looking to prepare for the hardest part of the role. You&rsquo;re learning more about the role and confirming that you can handle it.</p><h3> 2. How would you describe the company culture?</h3><p> <br/> A huge part of candidate retention is company fit. Some companies utilize  <a href=\"http://www.ideal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  culture fit assessments </a>  before even interviewing a candidate. By asking this you are showing that you understand the importance of fit and you are assessing if you think it is a good match.</p><h3> 3. How does the office communicate?</h3><p> <br/> Asking about communication specifically can be very telling about an organization. Group chat? Slack? Emails? Face-to-face? You can learn a lot from this one.</p><h3> 4. What are the core responsibilities of this position?</h3><p> <br/> Job descriptions can be long and wordy. Get a summary right from the source! It also shows you are looking to learn about the real responsibilities you will (hopefully) have.</p><h3> 5. How do you describe the learning curve for this position?</h3><p> <br/> This is a great question. The role you are filling has likely been filled before. By finding out more about the learning curve you will be able to set reasonable expectations for yourself. You&rsquo;re also inquiring about the technical knowledge required in the role, showing you are interested in what you have to learn.</p><h3> 6. Could you describe a typical work week? Is overtime expected?</h3><p> <br/> Sales jobs vary. A lot. Even two roles with the same title can be very different from employer to employer. Depending on the answer this could also help you find out if the job is still a good fit for you.</p><h3> 7. Why is the last person who held this position leaving?</h3><p> <br/> This question can be very telling as well. Were they promoted? Fired? Let go? Did they leave on their own&hellip; a fair question to ask.</p><h3> 8. What are the personality traits required for being successful in this position?</h3><p> <br/> Companies that understand the predictive ability of  <a href=\"http://www.ideal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  sales specific personality assessments </a>  know the value of personality in sales performance. If they are able to articulate their key drivers (ex. results-oriented, team-oriented, competitive, analytical), this can help you assess your future fit. Again, you&rsquo;re showing that you see the value in these insights.</p><h3> 9. How much support is made available to individuals for professional development such as &ndash; professional courses, seminars and trainings?</h3><p> <br/> Very good question. A) You&rsquo;re learning what will be available to you B) You&rsquo;re showing you want to continue learning and believe in personal development.</p><h3> 10. When can I expect to be notified for the next interviewing process?</h3><p> <br/> Might seem obvious but in the flurry of an interview it&rsquo;s easy to forget this one and have no clue. The interviewer should have a clear answer for you and show they respect your decision making process as well. </p><p> What are we missing?

{"original_id":5371,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways to Boost Your Site Traffic Educating Rather Than Selling","link":"5-ways-to-boost-your-site-traffic-educating-rather-than-selling","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to  <a href=\"https://www.marketo.com/inbound-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Marketo </a> , &ldquo;Inbound marketing is a strategy that utilizes many forms of pull marketing &ndash; content marketing, blogs, events, SEO, social media and more &ndash; to create brand awareness and attract new business. Inbound marketing earns the attention of customers and makes the company easy to be found.&rdquo;There are many ways to boost traffic to your website and better engage your audience. But, which form of inbound marketing is the best? The answer varies from business to business. In a day and age where people prefer to be educated rather than sold, content creation is the key to connecting and engaging your audience, and further boosting traffic to your Advisor website.Here are 5 different types of content you should start (or continue) to create for your website to help boost your traffic and engage your audience:</p><h3> 1. Infographics</h3>Researchers found that colored visuals increase people&rsquo;s willingness to read a piece of content by 80% (<a href=\"http://www.office.xerox.com/latest/COLFS-02UA.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Xerox</a>). Infographics are a great way to share information with your audience in a simplified and visually appealing way. To get started, check out some <a href=\"https://venngage.com/templates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> free infographic templates</a>, provided Venngage (sign up required).<h3> 2. Videos</h3>51.9% of marketing professionals worldwide name video as the type of content with the best ROI (Adobe). Whether it is an informational video describing the difference between an RRSP and a TFSA or a welcome video introducing yourself to your online audience, there are many easy ways to incorporate video into your Financial Advisor website.<h3> 3. Webinars</h3>According to <a href=\"https://paramountbusinesscoach.com/host-webinar-9-fantastic-webinar-benefits/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Entrepreneurs Forum</a>, hosting a webinar creates several benefits for your business including:<li> Develops authority and trust with prospects and clients</li><li> Raises brand awareness by providing users an uninterrupted way to advertise your business</li><li> Grows your contact list</li><li> Generates qualified leads</li><li> Shows off your brand&rsquo;s personality &ndash; something that isn&rsquo;t as easily done through the written word</li>Webinars are a powerful tool for interacting and connecting with prospects and clients. Hosting a webinar allows your audience to get to know you, as a Financial Advisor, on a much deeper level than they would if they were to only read website content.<h3> 4. eBooks</h3>eBooks are a great way to compile your existing blog content and dive deeper into a specific topic. For example, we have compiled some of our existing blog content into an eBook: The Financial and Insurance Advisor&rsquo;s Guide to Content Marketing. eBooks have a higher perceived value to your readers who will be more willing to give you their contact information in exchange for access to your eBook. Readers are more likely to feel like this was a fair exchange as you supply them with instant access to a valuable piece of content that they are interested in.<h3> 5. Blogs</h3>81% of U.S. online consumers trust information and advice from blogs (<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/BlogHer/2012-social-media-final-v2?ref=http://www.blogher.com/women-and-social-media-2012\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> BlogHer</a>). Blogging is one of the best ways to have a conversation with your audience by answering questions they may have in a non-intrusive manner. Research some of the questions that your audience has, or what information they enjoy reading and use that to your advantage by writing about it.  Over time, this will help you build valuable, trusted relationships with prospects and clients.There is a wide range of content that you can create to better engage, inform, and connect with prospects, clients and industry leaders. Some other examples of different types of content are:<li> Newsletters</li><li> Memes</li><li> Reviews</li><li> How-to-guides</li><li> Case studies</li><li> Podcasts</li><li> Interviews</li><li> Slideshares</li><li> Social Media</li><li> Opinion pieces</li>Aside from the clear benefits mentioned from creating a variety of content for your audience, doing this will also help to improve your SEO and search engine rankings.

The  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/13/coming-soon-the-biggest-wealth-transfer-in-history.html\" target=\"_blank\">  biggest wealth transfer in history  </a> is beginning, as Millennials will soon become the wealth bearing demographic in this county.  Not surprisingly, as we pointed out in a  <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/personal-finance-didnt-learn/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Personal%20Finance%20Blog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent blog post </a> , personal finance is a huge issue for many Millennials. But where can a Millennial turn for advice?Goals, dreams, jobs, family plans, etc. are going to vary widely, but there a few common themes that seem relevant across the spectrum. We constantly write on many of these issues, so decided to summarize the topics for you and answer some of those nagging questions.</p><h3> <strong>  Getting started is often the hardest part </strong></h3>Beginning a savings plan early is key, which makes planning all the more important. We constantly preach the importance of determining your short, intermediate and long term goals and then focusing on creating a plan on how to achieve them. Having the &ldquo;money conversation&rdquo; is a great way to get started. Remember, it&rsquo;s not how much you make, but how much you save. Read more here on <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/money-conversation/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Money%20Conversation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> getting started with the money conversation</a>.<h3> <strong>  Student Loans/Debt </strong></h3>A common financial hurdle for many millennials is navigating student loans. So how do you determine if your focus should be on accelerating the payoff of that debt or maximizing saving instead? We wrote about that <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/save-money-pay-debt/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Save%20Money%20or%20Pay%20Down%20Debt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>.<h3> <strong>  Investing  </strong></h3>Only 26 percent of people under age 30 own stocks, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/more-millennials-say-no-to-stocks-and-advisors-adapt.html\" target=\"_blank\"> CNBC story. </a>Time is one of the greatest assets Millennials have working in their favor. Yet  because of various reasons that have scared many away from the stock market, a vast majority of millennials are missing out on <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Volatility%20and%20Compound%20Interest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> potential compound interest</a>, and other benefits of long term investing. Fear and lack of financial comfort or literacy are two main reasons Millennials shy away from investing. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/ryans-open-letter-to-cnbc/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Millennials%20Letter%20CNBC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> I even responded to a Millennial&rsquo;s letter to CNBC here</a>.  If you are unsure about some of the reasons you may want to consider exploring the stock market, read our blog on why <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/millennials-time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-stock-market/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Millennials%20Wake%20Up\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Millennials should wake up and smell the stock market</a>.<h3> <strong>  Knowing Who to Trust </strong></h3>Even if you understand the advantages of investing in the stock market, it&rsquo;s not always easy to find a professional you can trust. A recent <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2016/01/25/millennials-money-the-unfiltered-journey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook study</a> shows that over 50% of millennials have no one to trust for financial guidance.A few months back we wrote a piece titled <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/minimum-balance-wells-fargo/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=Why%20Go%20Where%20Money%20Not%20Wanted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo;Why Go Where Your Money&rsquo;s Not Wanted&rdquo; </a>that touches on the point of many financial institutions turning down Millennials as clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net worth clients because it creates &ldquo;efficiencies of scale&rdquo; and a higher profit margin on larger trades. As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first time investors, it&rsquo;s actually one of the main reasons I created Sherman Wealth Management. It was important to me to make sure top notch financial advice was available to anyone and everyone,  particularly to those who are starting out on the path to wealth accumulation. We created this guide to make sure you are asking your potential financial advisors the right questions to determine if they are right for you. &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/6-questions-ask-financial-advisor/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=6%20questions%20to%20ask%20advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 6 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor</a><h3> <strong>  Marriage </strong></h3>Getting married is more than just substituting the word &ldquo;ours&rdquo; for &ldquo;yours&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s combining your finances, histories, dreams, aspirations, possessions &ndash; even your music &ndash; and making all of that &ldquo;ours&rdquo; too. If you have started to think about marriage, or are married already, there are a few financial discussions you should be sure you have.  Since a significant part of those pre-marital dreams and aspirations involve money, having multiple financial conversations before marriage (or right after, if you&rsquo;re newlyweds!) can help you start married life on a firmer footing, with regard to financial goals. Here are two blogs we wrote for those getting married or already married.<a href=\"/advisor/10-important-things-to-discuss-before-marriage\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 10 Things to Discuss Before Marriage</a><a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/7-things-married-couples-discuss-today/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Where%20Millennials%20Can%20Turn&amp;utm_campaign=7%20Things%20Married%20Couples%20Should%20Discuss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 7 Things Married Couples Should Discuss Today</a><h3> <strong>  Buying a house </strong></h3>There are studies out there saying that Millennials are not buying houses. A prudent home purchase often can be one of the most stable and solid investments a young person can make. So why the hesitation? Some Millennials wonder if given the rate increase and current market turmoil &ndash; if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now?

The question to ask is&rdquo; How are you going to defend your fees, especially for CRM2 regulation in Canada, without a quality financial plan? We should start by asking the critical question&rdquo; what is a quality financial plan?</p><h3> <strong>  Start with goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> How many goals do you get from your clients? Besides the major retirement goal, do you get other clients goals such as family or parents healthcare, home renovations or changes, education, estate planning, gifts donations or charities? A typical advisor gets less than 3 goals while client driven plans get 7 or more goals. Looking at the goals list below, how many goals can you check off?</p><h3> <strong>  Goals Based Planning Exercise </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> ____ Lifestyle - Retire / slow down / part time <br/> ____ Debts- Debt reduction-debt free <br/> ____ Education &ndash; Children / Self <br/> ____ Vehicles &ndash; Cars / Boat / RV / collector <br/> ____ Major purchase &ndash; Vacation property / Lifetime Trip <br/> ____ Travel -Vacation property / Trips / bucket list <br/> ____ Health care &ndash; Family members / personal health <br/> ____ Home &ndash; Reno&rsquo;s / Upgrades / downsizing <br/> ____ Celebrations- Weddings / birthdays <br/> ____ Estate- legacy- family-wishes <br/> ____ Gifts- donations / charitable involvement <br/> ____ Bequests &ndash; Philanthropic goals / legacy <br/> ____ Care for someone &ndash; elderly / family <br/> ____ Business &ndash; Investment / opportunity <br/> ____ Career &ndash; education / changes / courses <br/> ____ Memberships / Hobbies &ndash; golf or sports clubs / groups / collections</p><p> Whenever I share this list with advisors in my workshops, they usually add to the list. Go ahead, make it your list and put it in front of your clients and prospects and ask them this question&rdquo; looking at this list, is there any goal that jumps out to you that you have been thinking about?&rdquo;.</p><h3> <strong>  What data is missing? </strong></h3><p> <br/> I hate factfinders, they are painful and boring and are not engaging. Finding out their personal income by finding out more than one goal will help you gather the information. If you get more than 6 goals from a client, you are well on your way to gathering critical financial planning information. However, what sometimes missing in financial plans are life expectancy, personal health information including smoking, net worth and other assets or liabilities list such as business assets or liabilities, stock options and deferred compensation options. What risk data or software do you use and does it include insurance risks such as life and disability insurance, long term care needs and longevity risk along with market risk and inflation risk.</p><h3> <strong>  What do your clients expect? </strong></h3><p> <br/> While clients may feel confident in the value you deliver, and what they pay for the value, delivering more will eventually become commonplace. As Warren Buffet said&rdquo; Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.&rdquo;. What is a quality financial plan? What is the value of having a quality financial plan? How often do clients want their financial plans updated or discussed? These are great questions to ask your best clients who are paying thousands of dollars to you and your firm. Some advisors and clients do not see the value of having a quality financial plan. The days of drafting a large financial plan consisting of 30-50+ pages and then putting it on the shelf and never looked at again may be over.</p><h3> <strong>  What does a quality financial plan mean to you? </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is a great question to ask your ideal clients, your staff, your own family members and most importantly, yourself. Start by defining what a quality financial plan means to you. Is it comprehensive? Is it coordinated with other professionals? Clients want to know, am I going to be ok and meet my goals , and am I on track. Delivering these answers is not easy, however can become easier with a quality financial plan.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-01 16:34:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-01 16:34:11.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_RekhBMC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-it-possible-to-deliver-your-value-without-a-quality-financial-plan/\", \"post_id\": \"11455\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-01 16:34:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-01 16:34:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-it-possible-to-deliver-your-value-without-a-quality-financial-plan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11454\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5595\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Is-It-Possible-to-Deliver-Your-Value-Without-a-Quality-Financial-Plan.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"586\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464854400,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5374,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The #1 Most Overlooked Factor In Increasing Win Rates","link":"the-1-most-overlooked-factor-in-increasing-win-rates","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Quick question: what&rsquo;s the #1 most overlooked factor in increasing win rates ?</h3>Hiring better salespeople ? Developing more compelling proposals ? Qualifying better/harder ? Lowering your prices ?(Answer: none of the above).Recent research from RAIN Group suggests that one of the most powerful factors for increasing win rates is this: improve your sales process.It&rsquo;s that simple.<h3> The 5 Levels Of Sales Process Development</h3>Unfortunately, most of us have got a long way to go when it comes to sales process improvement. According to our research, only 49% of organisations have formally defined their sales process. In the <a href=\"http://info.rainsalestraining.com/complimentary-white-paper-8-drivers-of-sales-performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> RAIN Group research</a>, we identify five levels of sales process development:<li> <strong>  Ad Hoc (Chaos):  </strong> No consistent process or framework for planning to win opportunities.</li><li> <strong>  Emerging: </strong>  Some consistency and planning framework, but still work to do to standardize it and make it complete.</li><li> <strong>  Defined:  </strong> Our opportunity management process is defined and we have a tool to guide us to win opportunities.</li><li> <strong>  Managed (Adoptive): </strong>  Number 3, plus it&rsquo;s easy to use, includes specific details and guidance for selling, the process is managed well and helpful to sellers.</li><li> <strong>  World-Class (Adaptive): </strong>  Number 4, plus it&rsquo;s always being measured and improved, it includes best practices for strategies and tactics across the sales cycle, and the process and planning tools are embedded in sellers&rsquo; work ow and technology.</li>As the research indicates, roughly half of the sales organizations don&rsquo;t even make it to Level 3 &ndash; Defined. Now if you&rsquo;re a sales manager, you might say, &ldquo;Ago, I agree. But we&rsquo;ve done OK thus far, so why the need to improve ?&rdquo;Here&rsquo;s why: you&rsquo;re leaving money on the table. And quite a bit of it too.But don&rsquo;t take my word for it &ndash; check out the graph below.<img alt=\"\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/proposals-won-lost.png\" width=\"766\"/>Notice anything ? As the maturity of the sales process increases, so does the average win rate. Organisations with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVGpu91CgYM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> world-class sales process</a> have a 30% higher win rate, and lose far fewer deals to competitors and the dreaded &laquo; status quo &raquo;.Think about this for a second: what if you were able to increase your win rate by just 10 % ? What would that do for overall revenue growth ? Margins ? Bottom line profits ? Seller motivation ? Your own career ?Most sales managers would give anything for an increase like that &ndash; but many fail to understand that increasing win rates is really all about executing on the fundamentals.In fact, the research suggests that the more mature the sales process, the more likely organisations were to grow revenues by 20% or more. That&rsquo;s fully one-fifth revenue growth.What if you could make that happen ?<h3> Increasing Win Rates: One Step At A Time</h3>Now, granted, putting in place a smoothly running sales process is not easy &ndash; and you certainly can&rsquo;t just go from &laquo; no sales process &raquo; to &laquo; world class &raquo; in a single step.Your first job is to find out where your organisation currently ranks. At its most basic, that means conducting an internal assessment of your sales process, and asking the following five questions :<li> Do we have a sales process in place ? If so, is it clearly defined ?</li><li> Is it known and communicated throughout the organisation ?</li><li> Is it used consistently across the organisation ?</li><li> Is it supported by the necessary tools, definitions and frameworks ?</li><li> Are we consistently searching for ways to improve upon it ?</li>If you&rsquo;re on Level 1-2, your first order of business should be to define your sales process. That&rsquo;s not rocket science. All it takes is working out a basic, defined process for managing sales opportunities, and ensure it&rsquo;s implemented in a coherent fashion across the organisations.With time, taking (just) that first step should result in substantial increases in competitive wins. But by all means, don&rsquo;t stop there.If you&rsquo;ve already defined your sales process, the next step is to get to Level 4 &ndash; Managed. That means building things like playbooks, checklists and job aids to ensure sellers don&rsquo;t have to keep reinventing the wheel, and remember long lists off the top of their heads.As Atul Gawande, author of &laquo; The Checklist Manifesto &raquo;, observes &laquo; under conditions of complexity, not only are checklists a help, but they are required for success. The checklist gets the dumb stuff out of the way &raquo; &ndash; meaning sellers can focus on executing against <a href=\"/grow/sales-strategy/the-7-stages-of-the-new-buying-cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> high added-value activities with their buyers</a>.Finally, if you&rsquo;re already operating at Level 4 (congratulations), it&rsquo;s really all about committing to continuous, incremental improvement. The difference  between a  process at level 4 versus level 5 is that the process is &ldquo;continuously improved, supports maximum value for buyers, and consistently helps sellers win sales and develop deep relationships with buyers.&rdquo;This is the pinnacle of the pinnacle. Only 8% of all organizations get here. But when they do, the results are impressive.In 2016, there really is no excuse to not have a formally defined sales process. The knowledge, tools and frameworks are all there. Start there to get the basics in place.However, the truly defining factor in increasing win rates is not just to have one, but to have one that works, and that is implemented consistently across the organization. And then to keep tweaking it, fine tuning it and ensuring it&rsquo;s continually developed and enhanced.After all, as Salvador Dali once said &ldquo;Have no fear of perfection. You&rsquo;ll never reach it&rdquo;.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-01 16:41:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-01 16:41:07.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_da3iGqt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-1-most-overlooked-factor-in-increasing-win-rates/\", \"post_id\": \"11458\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-01 16:41:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-01 16:41:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-1-most-overlooked-factor-in-increasing-win-rates\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11456\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5596\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-1-Most-Overlooked-Factor-In-Increasing-Win-Rates.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"727\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464886800,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}

Perhaps a silly question because you are probably a Financial Adviser reading this blog post! However, think for a moment, if you weren&rsquo;t an Adviser and you started looking for one, how would you know if you could trust someone else or not?</p><p> There are a few reasons why someone would think they need to seek financial advice. And, there are typically two channels that they would use to find one. Either directly through their research or, referred by someone. Whichever way they go about finding an adviser, the burning question in the back of their mind is, how do I know I can trust you?</p><p> I think that when someone meets an adviser, most do an excellent job at demonstrating their trust and helping relieve that burning question from the clients mind. However, I know through the customer research that SRSCC has undertaken, that it can take weeks, months even years before someone finally picks up the phone and makes that call to an Adviser! So, what do you have in place to demonstrate to a potential client [while they sit and procastinate] that you can be trusted, and I&rsquo;m sorry to put this point down but especially given the regular negative media that the industry receives?</p><h3> Below are seven points that I would like you to consider.</h3><p> <br/> Think how your business demonstrates on a consistent basis that you and your team can be trusted. Trusted to deliver what you say you will, trusted that you will have total duty of care, that you will not invest poorly, that you have the clients best interests at hand all the time plus all the other concerns a potential client will have.</p><p> <strong>  1. Where on your website do you address those common fears that potential clients have? </strong> Don&rsquo;t ignore them! They are potentially thinking it so help alleviate their concerns.</p><p> <strong>  2. What information do your strategic alliances </strong> [referral parterns] have that helps answer all those concerns with clients that they wish to introduce to you?</p><p> <strong>  3. How visible are your credentials? </strong> Have you listed them on all your online platforms? Where on your website have you placed them? Do you explain what they mean in the context of the client? For example, we may know what a CFP is, but do the general public? If you are part of an association, explain why and how that benefits the client.</p><p> <strong>  4. As I always say, you can talk about how good you are until the cows come home </strong> but where on your digital and traditional marketing information do your clients talk about how well you can be trusted?</p><p> <strong>  5. How many existing clients refer their friends and family? </strong> Interesting one to look at.</p><p> <strong>  6. If you completed an audit of all your marketing activities </strong> , does it shout that you can be trusted or is that part missing?</p><p> <strong>  7. How do your team articulate the trust factor when they are talking with others? </strong> I would recommend that given the current landscape that this is worked into all your client conversations.

However, there is a surprising cohort of women who fare even worse than widows. Older divorced women are more likely to be poor than older widows, and trends suggest that, in the future, a larger share of retired women will be divorced.</p><p> According to the Social Security Administration&rsquo;s Office of Retirement and Disability Policy, women who are divorced have dramatically lower incomes and higher poverty rates than widows and other Social Security beneficiaries. According to the data, around 20% of divorced women aged 65 or older live in poverty, compared with 15% of widowed women. Not a good statistic.</p><h3> <strong>  Why is this the case? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Women who are not eligible for Social Security, because they did not have strong work histories, are most at risk. To compound the problem, these women cannot collect on their ex-spouses&rsquo; benefit if they were not married for at least 10 years.</p><p> The old adage &ldquo;man as a financial plan&rdquo; still exists. Many women still rely on their husbands to make the important financial decisions of the household throughout the marriage. These women then find themselves lost when they are forced to do this on their own. Lack of confidence in their financial knowledge then causes them to invest much more conservatively than they should, hamstringing the growth of their portfolio.</p><p> Women also spend more time out of the workforce than men. While stay-at-home fatherhood is slowly becoming more of a social fact of life, women are still more likely to take time off from their careers to provide full-time care for their children. Of course, less time spent in the working world translates to lower salaries, which, in turn, affects pension and Social Security benefits.</p><p> Even if a woman remains fully engaged in the workforce her entire life, it is common knowledge that women make less money than men. Women, on average, earn only $0.77 for every dollar earned by their male counterparts, according to a survey by the Society of Actuaries and the Women&rsquo;s Institute for a Secure Retirement, which puts them at an automatic handicap when it comes to savings. Unsurprisingly, this survey also found that women tend to have less savings than men.</p><h3> <strong>  What can women do to protect themselves? </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are several actions that women can take to avoid being cash-strapped during retirement, the most essential of which is to begin saving early. If you&rsquo;re eligible for an employer-sponsored retirement plan, participate, and be sure to take advantage of whatever matching incentives your company offers. Take advantage of catch-up 401(k) or IRA contributions if you&rsquo;re over the age of 50 and have the means to ramp up your tax-deferred savings. Also ensure that you are invested aggressively enough. Consider a riskier blend of investments to generate a higher return. This will help your portfolio grow faster over time. Finally, educate yourself. Studies show that women who are more educated about their finances have more in savings and invest more aggressively&ndash;both essential ingredients for successfully funding those retirement years.</p><p> Women shouldn&rsquo;t wait for a traumatic emotional and financial event such as widowhood or divorce to start thinking about their financial future. Take steps now to avoid facing an uncertain retirement.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-01 16:48:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-01 16:48:37.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_1YzSLDz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-it-comes-to-money-it-is-better-to-be-widowed-than-divorced/\", \"post_id\": \"11462\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-01 16:48:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-01 16:48:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-it-comes-to-money-it-is-better-to-be-widowed-than-divorced\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11461\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5598\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/When-It-Comes-to-Money-It-Is-Better-to-Be-Widowed-Than-Divorced_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1042\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464879600,"author_id":449,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5377,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: How to Create Sufficient Post-Exit Income","link":"advisors-how-to-create-sufficient-post-exit-income","source_link":null,"content":"<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/business/\" target=\"_blank\"> Business</a> owners have always sought, with varying degrees of success, to create a stream of income after we exit our companies that matches the income we enjoy while owning them. Today, the difficulty of that task has increased exponentially for three reasons.<li> The growth of the S&amp;P 500, including dividends, has averaged  <a href=\"http://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  4.25 percent </a>  in this century and the current yield on the Treasuries is 1.8 percent. This means investment growth and income has remains stubbornly low. So today&rsquo;s post-exit investment income is far lower than pre-2000.</li><li> Earnings multiples that buyers are willing to pay for businesses worth a few million dollars (and less) do not seem to have risen as much as multiples for businesses worth $5,000,000 and more.</li><li> Life expectancies for you and your spouse have risen.</li><h3> Our post-exit income streams have to last a lot longer than most of us anticipated, so it is very difficult for owners to exit their companies and maintain their pre-exit lifestyles.</h3>Recall Larry Dykes from <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/should-i-sell-my-business-three-lessons-to-be-learned\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> the prior post</a>. His company&rsquo;s valuation of  $2,500,000 was based largely on a multiple of its pre-tax earnings of $500,000 to $750,000. As a mature business with no debt and little need for cash flow to fund growth, these pre-tax earnings could be distributed to Larry as &ldquo;S&rdquo; distributions. Upon a sale of the business for $2,500,000 cash, Larry could expect, after taxes and costs of sale, proceeds of $1,800,000.  Once he invested the proceeds, Larry could withdraw 4 percent per year&mdash;a rate currently deemed reasonable by most financial planners.Larry&rsquo;s income stream from his sale proceeds is less than $75,000 a year&mdash;a tenth of the stream available to him pre-sale (and that&rsquo;s without considering Larry&rsquo;s pre-exit salary of $250,000 which he will not receive after he exits).Larry and his wife lived on $300,000 annually. To maintain that lifestyle post-ownership, they would need capital of approximately $7,500,000. Even at that, the additional pre-tax earnings of up to $750,000 would no longer be availableSmall wonder then that many owners feel compelled to continue in their businesses beyond their hoped-for exit date.<h3> <strong>  How Can You Create Sufficient Post-Exit Income? </strong></h3><li> Prepare for your inevitable exit by investing the excess distributions you receive today from your business.  Larry was able to invest $250,000-$400,000 a year&mdash;the after-tax amount of the earnings that could be distributed to him.</li><li> Focus on growing business value and cash flow. Engage in an exit planning process with skilled advisors. As part of that process you will focus on methods, tools and designs to increase transferable value. A side benefit of this process is that your role will likely change&mdash;for the better. Your day-to-day &ldquo;hands-on head-down&rdquo; efforts must give way to a &ldquo;head-up hands-off&rdquo; if the company is to have full value without your leadership. I find that owners find much greater enjoyment in doing what they do best, rather than doing what they believe they have to do.</li><li> Accept that you may have to remain in the business longer than you planned. Prepare yourself and your business for this reality.</li>The longer you wait to accumulate outside wealth, grow business value and carry on as usual, the longer you will remain in the harness.<h3> <strong>  The alternatives to tackling the task of creating sufficient post-exit income are: </strong></h3><li> Remain in the business indefinitely.</li><li> Exit and reduce your lifestyle.</li>The consequences of staying in your business or exiting it are dramatic, but the great thing about being an owner is that the decision is yours.The reality for most successful owners is that only way to achieve our aspirations is to bring grit and determination to tackling the challenges we face and to create a strategy to overcome them.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-01 16:52:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-01 16:52:36.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_xzoTYTH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-how-to-create-sufficient-post-exit-income/\", \"post_id\": \"11464\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-01 16:52:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-01 16:52:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-how-to-create-sufficient-post-exit-income\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11463\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5599\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Advisors-How-to-Create-Sufficient-Post-Exit-Income.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"634\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464858000,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5378,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Compensation Planning to Incentivize Top Talent","link":"compensation-planning-to-incentivize-top-talent","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Company management, and human resource departments in particular, are often guilty of treating talent management solutions as five or more separate processes used to build a strong employee base. However, it is the integration and flow between all these applications, that when correctly used allows exceptional organizations to leave their competition in the dust. Consider how compensation planning and management factors into every facet of an individual business.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s consider performance management. How does one properly incentivize top talent to achieve targeted business goals? According Towers Watson, &ldquo;61% of workers don&rsquo;t see a clear link between pay and performance.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because performance management processes are rooted in forty year old methodologies. Consider these three points in re-engineering your pay for performance model.</p><h3> <strong>  Unleashing Top Performers </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you follow college basketball you will likely know that Michael Jordan&rsquo;s college coach was Dean Smith. It was often said that Smith was the only person in basketball who could hold Jordan to less than 20 points per game, because he forced him to play in a system.</p><p> It&rsquo;s often the case with high performers that you don&rsquo;t need to control them, you need to unleash them. Give them ultimate target goals, with high compensation rewards, rather than micromanage them to do things the company way. Aligning a top performer&rsquo;s self-interest with your company&rsquo;s goals is a win/win formula.</p><h3> <strong>  Focus on Future Potential </strong></h3><p> <br/> Intelligent people tend to get bored easily. So when reconsidering your performance management process, it must encompass future opportunities and developing potential. Not all high performers are necessarily high potentials, but being able to show your top talent that there are advancement opportunities with compensatory pay increases, is another key to keeping them onboard and productive.</p><h3> <strong>  Multiple Source Evaluation </strong></h3><p> <br/> How many other people in the company do your employees interact with in the doing and successful execution of their job. According to McKinsey and Company, social technologies will increase the  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-social-economy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  productivity of interaction by workers by as much as 25 percent </a> . Thus with more people knowing the value of your employees, it&rsquo;s important to get their perspective on how much you should compensate them to stay around.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get trapped in yesteryear&rsquo;s approach to measuring and rewarding talent. It will cost you those you have on board, and when the word gets out, limit those you are trying to bring onboard. There is still a place for smart, and relevant performance. If you use modern processes and technology with today&rsquo;s talent, the rewards you provide in both compensation and potential will keep your company growing.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-01 17:07:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-01 17:07:24.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_uL5qHRR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/compensation-planning-to-incentivize-top-talent/\", \"post_id\": \"11466\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-01 17:07:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-01 17:07:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"compensation-planning-to-incentivize-top-talent\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11465\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5600\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Compensation-Planning-to-Incentivize-Top-Talent.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"655\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464883200,"author_id":309,"chart_url":""}

We thought the results were worth sharing. Some of the findings were surprising, while others indicated best practices that many of our clients have been and will be using in the coming year. Overall, it seems like <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> B2B content marketers</a> are improving their game and getting on the right track.<h3> <strong>  1. Over half have content calendars. </strong></h3>Six out of 10 B2B content marketers have written, organized editorial calendars, with content planned out in advance. The most effective marketers have a<a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-b2b-content-marketing-failing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> documented content strategy</a> and a written plan for success, so this comes as no surprise. Part of what our consultants do is help businesses get organized using the latest planning software so there is a clear path forward for the year, while leaving a little bit of flexibility to accommodate late-breaking news.<h3> <strong>  2. Over a third reuse old content. </strong></h3>The survey found that 37% of B2B marketers &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-repurpose-old-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> reuse old content</a>. Creating brand new, high-quality content is time-consuming and expensive. Beyond conserving resources, repurposing content increases retention and impact of crucial marketing messages. So we were surprised to see so few B2B content marketers regularly reusing old content in new ways. You could take an old blog post and turn it into an infographic or short video, for instance. One of our favorite tactics is to revamp old blogs into eBooks. Or you could share an older tidbit on social media again. We usually post the same link across all our social media outlets 7 times to hit all different audiences at different times.<img alt=\"\" height=\"629\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/recycle-content.png\" width=\"888\"/><h3> <strong>  3. Most marketers target their content to buyer personas. </strong></h3>B2B marketers are becoming more focused, with 28% of marketers targeting both buyer personas and buyer journeys. This is a smart practice, but it surprised us that 26% of marketers only used buyer personas and 9% only focused on the buyer&rsquo;s journey. <a href=\"https://blog.buyerpersona.com/2013/03/building-b2b-buyer-personas-focus-on-the-buying-decision-then-the-person.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> As Adele Ravella stated</a>, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned that so many people think that buyer personas begin and end with a description of a person.&rdquo; Demographics mean little if you don&rsquo;t understand how ready to buy a person may be. That&rsquo;s why we teach companies how to automate life cycle nurturing using marketing technology. We recently shared how understanding the buyer&rsquo;s journey helps <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/increase-saas-free-trial-conversion-rate/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> SaaS companies convert more trial users into paying customers</a>.<h3> <strong>  4. Technical SEO is widely understood. </strong></h3>Content marketers understand that a fast, mobile-optimized site is the foundation for all else. These days, 62% of B2B content marketers say they&rsquo;re either &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; in <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/search-engine-optimization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> technical SEO and optimization practices</a>. Only 13% of those surveyed admitted their SEO capabilities were &ldquo;poor&rdquo; and in need of help.<h3> <strong>  5. They&rsquo;re in the midst of utilizing technology to market smarter. </strong></h3>B2B marketers know they need to be on the ball with the right technology to market more effectively. While they all understand the need for <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/marketing-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> marketing automation</a>, they rated their use of this technology a 6 out of 10, meaning there is still a ways to go. Not surprisingly, the marketers who were best equipped with the right tools and using data for decision making were the most effective content marketers.<h3> <strong>  6. They&rsquo;re keeping tabs on competitors. </strong></h3>It&rsquo;s a dog-eat-dog world for most B2B industries and 36% of marketers know that because they&rsquo;re frequently monitoring the competition. Those who checked say they did so once a month or more. Surprisingly, 26% said they don&rsquo;t run reports on the competition at all. Our consultants can help you dig up insights into industry best practices, as well as missed areas of opportunity to capture greater market share, with a <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/creative-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> competitive analysis</a>.<img alt=\"\" height=\"623\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/analyze-competition.png\" width=\"879\"/><h3> <strong>  7. Blogs and videos are still the dominant mediums of choice. </strong></h3>Whitepapers recently joined blogs and video as the top types of content used by B2B content marketers. Their least favorite or least used mediums included spreadsheets and eBooks. On one hand, eBooks could be more expensive or time-consuming to create because they&rsquo;re longer and more in-depth, but by the same token, eBook guides to their products could be a fantastic and useful resource for prospects in the later stages of the buyer&rsquo;s journey. Many B2B customers fail to use trials or abandon them without converting, for instance, because they fail to truly understand the product and all the different ways to use it. Sure, videos and tutorials can be good for this, but an eBook is another way to hit the crowd that may want to skim through a more thorough explanation. We also use eBooks for our clients as an opt-in to expand targeted email marketing lists.<h3> <strong>  8. B2B Marketers are moving in the right direction, but could do better. </strong></h3>Conductor Spotlight analysts conclude that B2B marketers are moving toward adopting and using many of the best practices for <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/solutions/content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> content marketing</a>.

Only a month remains before voters decide whether the country will stay in or leave the European Union. As I said before, an exit could  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/gold-takes-a-breather-is-this-the-buying-opportunity-investors-are-looking-for1/#stay-or-go/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  trigger a currency crisis </a>  with both the euro and pound, in which case owning gold might be a good idea.</p><p> Speaking of the yellow metal, I had the opportunity to meet with the World Gold Council (WGC) while I was in London. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to share with you that the group&rsquo;s CEO, Aram Shishmanian, has agreed to join me as a special guest during our next webcast, scheduled for Wednesday, June 8. We&rsquo;ll be discussing gold, specifically the reasons behind its rally this year and the pullback we&rsquo;re seeing this month. I highly urge you to  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/webcast-all-eyes-on-gold/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  register for the webcast </a>  because you won&rsquo;t want to miss Aram&rsquo;s rich insights into gold.</p><h3> <strong>  As Oil Hits $50 a Barrel, Americans Hit the Road </strong></h3><p> <br/> I was disappointed to see that U.S. manufacturing activity showed more signs of slowing growth, according to preliminary purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) data. The PMI posted a 50.8, just above the neutral 50.0 threshold separating expansion and deterioration. What&rsquo;s more, the index fell below its three-month moving average, which we&rsquo;ve found to be a headwind for commodities and energy three to six months out.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/composite-pmi.png\" width=\"603\"/></p><p> This could threaten additional recovery in the oil and gas industry. For the first time this year, West Texas Intermediate crude briefly touched $50 a barrel on Thursday last week. Prices between $50 and $60 are widely seen as a &ldquo;goldilocks&rdquo; scenario: high enough for oil companies to stay profitable yet low enough for consumers.</p><p> Gas prices, in fact, were expected to be the  <a href=\"http://newsroom.aaa.com/tag/memorial-day-travel-forecast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  lowest in 10 years </a>  this Memorial Day weekend, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA). The motor club estimated prices would average around $2.26 a gallon, or 45 cents less than last year. More than 38 million Americans were expected to travel this past weekend, AAA says, the second-highest volume on record. If you&rsquo;re one of them, I wish you happy, safe travels! But however you plan on spending the weekend, remember to honor those who bravely served the U.S. and gave the ultimate sacrifice.</p><h3> <strong>  The U.S. Can Now Export Weapons to Vietnam </strong></h3><p> <br/> Last Monday, Obama lifted the 40-year-old weapons embargo against Vietnam, ending what many see as the last vestige of the U.S. and Southeast Asian country&rsquo;s former animosity. It was also part of his administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; to Asia to deepen relations with countries in the fastest growing region of the world.</p><p> Indeed, Vietnam is in an exciting position right now. In the fourth quarter of 2015, its gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate expanded an impressive 7.01 percent, and Goldman Sachs predicts its economy will become the 17th largest by 2025, up from 55th today. The most populous city, Ho Chi Minh City, commonly known as Saigon, has blossomed into one of the world&rsquo;s premier manufacturing and tech startup hubs, with huge investments flowing in from companies such as Samsung and Intel.</p><p> Vietnam&rsquo;s defense spending has also been growing rapidly in recent years, and today a lot of business is up for grabs. Between 2011 and 2015, the country was the world&rsquo;s eighth largest arms importer, just one rung above the U.S., according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). This year it&rsquo;s expected to spend $5 billion, a dramatic increase from the estimated $1 billion it spent in 2005.</p><p> With the embargo out of the way, American aerospace and defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have the opportunity to move into this new Asian market. Boosted by recent geopolitical fears and  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/heres-the-cost-of-global-terrorism/#.V0coLOQer0w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  terrorist activity </a> , both companies are trending near their all-time highs.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lockheed-martin.png\" width=\"617\"/></p><p> They also provide attractive dividends, which are increasingly sought-after in a world that&rsquo;s seen a third of all government bond yields around the world turn negative.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/yield-starved-foreign-investors-are-flooding-the-us-muni-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Read how negative interest rates are also pushing foreign investors into American muni bonds! </a></p><h3> <strong>  Selling the TPP </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of Obama&rsquo;s main objectives in visiting Vietnam and Japan was to shore up support for the TPP, the historic trade agreement that, if ratified by all 12 participating countries, is designed to eliminate as many as 18,000 tariffs. Sixteen to 30 years after ratification, 99 percent of all goods trade among these countries will be entirely liberalized.</p><p> In the map below, you can see the massive scale of who&rsquo;s involved. TPP countries have a combined GDP of $28 trillion, close to 40 percent of world GDP, and they account for almost a quarter of total world exports.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/total-trade-TPP.png\" width=\"627\"/></p><p> Vietnam has  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/how-these-12-tpp-nations-could-forever-change-global-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the most to gain from the TPP </a>  Eliminating thousands of tariffs should allow its important apparel and textile industry to export even more goods to the U.S. In turn, the U.S. would have the opportunity to sell more vehicles in the Asian country. The World Bank estimates a 10 percent bump in Vietnam&rsquo;s economy over a decade as a result of the deal.</p><p> Among the TPP countries, the U.S. runs the largest trade deficit, which widened to $57.5 billion in April. As you can see, the U.S. has an unfavorable (and worsening) trade gap with Vietnam (-$2.7 billion in March) and Japan (-$6.7 billion). The TPP could help rebalance this.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/deficit-vietnam.png\" width=\"608\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/trade-rebalance-japan.png\" width=\"618\"/></p><p> According to the  <a href=\"https://piie.com/publications/working-papers/economic-effects-trans-pacific-partnership-new-estimates\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) </a> , the TPP &ldquo;will increase annual real incomes in the United States by $131 billion, or 0.5 percent of GDP, and annual exports by $357 billion, or 9.1 percent of exports, by 2030.&rdquo; For all member nations, the deal is expected to add $492 billion in real income.</p><h3> <strong>  Challenges Ahead </strong></h3><p> <br/> Of course, none of this will come to pass if the TPP can&rsquo;t be ratified. The PIIE warns that delaying the TPP&rsquo;s launch by even a year could lead to a permanent opportunity loss of between $77 billion and $123 billion for the U.S. Obama has repeatedly said he wants to see it passed by the end of 2016.</p><p> But a delay at this point appears highly possible, with both major U.S. presidential candidates opposing it. Support in Congress is muted. Of the 12 TPP countries, only Malaysia has ratified it.</p><p> There&rsquo;s still strong support for the deal. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, responding to recent positive findings by the International Trade Commission, wrote an open letter asserting its support, stating that passage of the TPP is critical for the U.S. to remain a leader in the global marketplace.</p><p> I agree. The deal is far from perfect, but it&rsquo;s what we need now to help reignite global growth.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-01 17:28:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-01 17:28:34.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_iCnsuQD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/can-the-trans-pacific-partnership-save-the-global-economy/\", \"post_id\": \"11476\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-01 17:28:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-01 17:28:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"can-the-trans-pacific-partnership-save-the-global-economy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11477\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5602\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Can-the-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Save-the-Global-Economy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1077\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464872400,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5382,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Gain Over Pain: Helping Investors Stay in the Game","link":"gain-over-pain-helping-investors-stay-in-the-game","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> <strong>  Our Two Primary Motivators Are Not Equal </strong></h3><p> <br/> Psychologists assert that all human motivation can be divided into two categories: gain and pain. Anytime we actually do something, we do it because we want to avoid pain or achieve gain.</p><p> I recently attended a presentation hosted by Steve McClatchy, leadership coach and author of  The New York Times bestseller Decide. According to McClatchy, &ldquo;Actions driven by gain produce far more significant positive results in your life and your business than tasks that you do to prevent pain.&rdquo;1</p><p> &ldquo;Prevent pain&rdquo; activities are the have-to-dos &mdash; paying bills, taking out the trash, responding to a negative email from a client, etc. If we don&rsquo;t do them, there will be negative consequences.</p><p> Gain activities don&rsquo;t have to be done, but if they are, they can improve our overall health, wealth and happiness. If we don&rsquo;t focus on gain activities, such as building strong relationships with family and clients or investing time in things we truly care about, we may never achieve our life goals.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s not that simple. Pain-driven activities typically get our attention first &mdash; they are the nagging, annoying tasks we simply can&rsquo;t avoid. Time and time again we sideline gain activities in favor of preventing pain.  </p><h3> <strong>  Helping Clients Overcome Loss Aversion </strong></h3><p> <br/> As financial professionals, it is our job to help ensure that our clients prioritize gain ahead of pain while also obtaining some level of comfort with pain. In our industry, we&rsquo;re all familiar with the idea that investors are driven by fear and greed. But let&rsquo;s put aside the negative connotations of greed for a moment and stay focused on the concepts of pain and gain.</p><p> One thing we know about the markets is that they are sure to go up and down. Loss aversion is a well-established cognitive bias in behavioral finance. While investors love to make money, they hate losing money much more. Time and again, investors underperform the benchmarks and do not achieve their long-term goals because they sell out of the market at the wrong time in order to avoid pain.</p><h3> <strong>  Running from Danger </strong></h3><p> <br/> Ironically, clients would have the same emotional response to a bear market as they would have to an actual bear chasing them in the woods. In either scenario, adrenaline spikes, areas of the brain responsible for rational decision-making are reduced, and the body turns on systems that can help a person run away from danger and preserve their safety.</p><p> The ability to conserve energy from systems that aren&rsquo;t absolutely necessary in favor of contributing energy to systems that can help us run away from danger made a lot of sense to our ancestors on the plains of the Sahara thousands of years ago. Unfortunately, those same systems can wreak havoc on our decision-making capabilities, and even our health, if they aren&rsquo;t kept in check.</p><h3> <strong>  Focusing on Growth and Safety </strong></h3><p> <br/> At Clark Capital, we focus on risk management so that clients can avoid making emotional decisions driven by loss aversion. One way we help investors prioritize gain over pain in their investment portfolios is by giving them the option to take a small piece of their portfolio and hedge it by using volatility instruments that track the VIX, such as ETFs like VXX, VIXM, and individual options contracts. For advisors and clients who choose to overlay a hedging strategy on a portfolio, the majority of the portfolio is focused on providing long-term gains.</p><p> The comfort of knowing that a small portion of the portfolio is invested in vehicles that typically go up when the market goes down can help investors focus on their life goal, such as funding a child&rsquo;s education, buying a second home, or leaving a legacy. <br/>  </p>1. <a href=\"http://alleer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DECIDE_Excerpt.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://alleer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DECIDE_Excerpt.pdf</a>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-01 18:12:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-01 18:12:50.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_fxHTZES.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/gain-over-pain-helping-investors-stay-in-the-game/\", \"post_id\": \"11481\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-01 18:12:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-01 18:12:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"gain-over-pain-helping-investors-stay-in-the-game\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11480\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5604\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Gain-Over-Pain-Helping-Investors-Stay-in-the-Game.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"739\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464926400,"author_id":376,"chart_url":""}

Time is money for everyone. Should someone choose to waste your time, whether intentional or not, it is highly likely that you will not make a repeat visit to their establishment.</p><p> A specific service is reported to take approximately 90 minutes. As a regular client, I have found this to be true&hellip;until today. The very same service took over 2 hours. The person was not ready to have been promoted to this position. It placed an extra burden on me, the client, as I had a need to prepare for a client.</p><p> Upon returning back to the office, I returned a call. After being on hold for a couple of minutes, the person said she was just finishing another call and to wait. Another five minutes passed and then I hung up the phone. She should have offered to return the call when she was ready.  But two hours later, I was the one to pick up the phone and call again.

Next, always add extra time required to your commitment.

But before you say yes, consider the following aspects.</p><p> Starting a new gig is a huge decision, one that you are stuck with for a long time. Before making your final decision, you should find out the answers to the questions below.</p><h3> <strong>  What Are You Actually Going to Be Earning? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Finding out what your income will be can often be murkier than it appears. Even if you&rsquo;re a salaried employee, there may be other opportunities to earn money, such as revenue-sharing, bonuses, commissions and more.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re going to be an hourly employee, there may be opportunities for overtime or even some of the options listed above. Hourly employees should find out if they are guaranteed to work a certain number of hours per week or if that will depend on external factors.</p><h3> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the Atmosphere Like? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Beyond how much you&rsquo;ll earn and what work you&rsquo;ll be responsible for, the most important aspect to a new job is figuring out what the culture is like. Is this a company where the CEO is addressed only by his last name? Or is this a firm where the HR department plans practical jokes for April Fool&rsquo;s?</p><p> Finding a company whose culture matches your personality can make the difference between dreading going to work and a lively morning commute.</p><h3> <strong>  Do They Pay for Certifications, Degrees, etc.? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many companies pay for college credit for their employees. This is how a lot of people are able to earn advanced degrees without going into debt. Ask if the company has a policy and how you can be eligible for it.</p><p> Even if they don&rsquo;t offer to pay for your degree, see if they will cover the cost of continuing education, conferences and special seminars.</p><h3> <strong>  What Are the Options for Health Insurance? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The cost for health insurance can differ greatly based on deductibles, copays, coinsurance, premiums, and coverage for spouses and dependents. Seeing the hard numbers for all the available plans can make it easier to compare it to your current coverage. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to contact the insurance company to see if your current providers will be accepted.</p><h3> <strong>  How Do They Review Employees? </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest ways a good job can turn sour is if you aren&rsquo;t sure how you can succeed. Some companies have set guidelines for performance reviews, while others offer feedback on a regular basis.</p><p> Find out how you will be evaluated, if pay is tied to performance and how often reviews will occur.</p><h3> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the Vacation Policy? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Comparing salaries can be easy &ndash; just take the higher number of the two. But vacation days is another story.</p><p> Vacation days, personal days, sick days and holidays vary from employer to employer. Find out the policies for each type of leave &ndash; how much notice do you have to give, what happens if you&rsquo;ve run out of paid time off and have an emergency, are you ever required to work on holidays, etc.</p><p> Some employers allow you to roll vacation days over into the next year; others have a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; policy. There are even companies that allow you buy vacation days for a set price, which can be one more benefit for those who love to travel or have family far away.</p><h3> <strong>  Do They Offer a Retirement Program? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many companies nowadays offer 401(k) or equivalent options to their employees. But not all retirement programs are created equal.</p><p> Ask about the matching program, vesting schedule and types of funds offered. The vesting schedule explains when you&rsquo;re eligible to take advantage of the employer contributions (some companies make you wait a few years before you can withdraw those, while others ensure you&rsquo;re vested immediately).</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-02 14:52:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-02 14:52:48.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_D4k4ALi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-things-to-consider-before-accepting-a-job-offer/\", \"post_id\": \"11485\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-02 14:52:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-02 14:52:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-things-to-consider-before-accepting-a-job-offer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11484\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5606\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-Things-to-Consider-Before-Accepting-a-Job-Offer.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"719\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464966000,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5385,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Grey Divorce Means Good Financial Planning a Must","link":"grey-divorce-means-good-financial-planning-a-must","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Canadian divorce rates for most age groups are on the decline with the exception of Baby Boomers (people born between 1946-1964). People over the age of 50 are calling it quits at a higher rate than younger people, leading to a trend which is being called &ldquo;grey divorce&rdquo;. While the reasons for ending the marriage (especially after several decades together) may include longer life expectancies, one major factor is that being divorced is no longer seen as a one-way ticket to financial hardship.</p><h3> Financial Decisions in Grey Divorce</h3><p> <br/> Going through a divorce is a major life change and even the most amicable splits have some element of pain and regret attached to them. When planning for the transition from &ldquo;we&rdquo; to &ldquo;me,&rdquo; financial decisions must be made with the head and not due to emotional attachments or a way to punish the former spouse.</p><p> <strong>  Should you Keep the House in a Divorce? </strong></p><p> Some women may decide very quickly in the separation process that they want to remain in the family home. This can be the right decision, but the benefits of staying in the same place (convenience, emotional attachment to the residence, stability for children or parents who share the home) must be weighed against the full cost of owning the house.</p><p> All homes require maintenance, and the cost of repairs (major and minor), property taxes and other expenses must be considered. Will a loan need to be taken out to buy out the other spouse&rsquo; share in the home? If so, the repayments will need to be factored into all the previously mentioned costs. The decision to keep the family home should only be made when you know for sure whether or not you can actually afford to keep the house.</p><p> <strong>  Will you be Able to Save for Retirement? </strong></p><p> You also need to ask yourself whether keeping the family home will be at the cost of your future retirement income. If your spouse will be retaining their pension plans, RRSPs and other assets while you keep the family home will you have the excess income required to start building your own retirement savings? Do you have enough years ahead of you to be able to adequately save for the retirement you want? Or will you be willing to downsize at a later date to help fund your retirement lifestyle?</p><p> <strong>  Protect Child and Spousal Support with a Life Insurance Policy </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s also important to take into consideration other assets such as life insurance policies. If you are receiving child support or spousal support (alimony), you will want to ensure those payments are protected in case your spouse should pass on.</p><p> If separation and grey divorce are inevitable then it is very important to get a handle on financial issues that may affect you now. as well as in the future. Making uninformed decisions today can have long-term consequences. Working with your own  <a href=\"http://www.rhondasherwood.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial advisor </a>  is a great first step in getting a clear idea of your current financial picture.

{"original_id":5386,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Why BOTH Partners Need to Meet With the Family Financial Advisor","link":"5-reasons-why-both-partners-need-to-meet-with-the-family-financial-advisor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As you know, tension over money is the leading cause of stress in relationships.  When I meet with my clients to discuss financial planning for their families, I consistently find that the purpose of the meeting is undermined when there is only one spouse present. Here are five drawbacks of having one, not both, partners present at a meeting with the family financial advisor.</p><p> <strong>  1. Conflicts may exist that you do not even realize.  </strong></p><p> If you think you and your spouse are on the same page about money, try sitting down with a financial advisor.  You may agree on the big picture (we want to own a house, we want to send our kids to college, we want to retire) but the devil is always in the details.  Forming a plan about **how** to achieve these big goals (even if you agree on what the big goals are) will require a detailed plan with specific action items affecting both your lives.  Assuming that your spouse will be on board with whatever you agree to do with your financial advisor (example, buying a new life insurance policy with a higher premium, cutting back on certain daily living expenses) can cause resentment when plans become reality.</p><p> <strong>  2. Mistakes </strong></p><p> Not having both partners at the meeting can result in misunderstandings, and even some pretty costly mistakes. I&rsquo;ll give you an example.  Almost every time I meet with the male partner, if he is the breadwinner his attitude towards life insurance commonly is, &ldquo;I need at least a million of insurance on me. My wife doesn&rsquo;t work so there&rsquo;s no (or little) need for any on her.&rdquo;  Well, if the wife were there I am sure she would not have neglected to mention the $40k in daycare expenses he would have to pay without her, and that&rsquo;s not to mention cooking, cleaning, driving the kids to doctor&rsquo;s visits, etc.  These &ldquo;services&rdquo;, if they had to be bought, would probably start at $10-15/hour if you want the same quality that she provides. It adds up. This can be a costly mistake that threatens the family&rsquo;s lifestyle; if something were to happen to the partner absent from the meeting, they wouldn&rsquo;t have enough resources to sustain their lifestyle, due to poor planning.</p><p> <strong>  3. Stalling. </strong></p><p> Over and over again, I meet with one spouse who says, &ldquo;Yes!  I totally agree that we should invest our money according to your plan, and my spouse will be totally onboard with whatever I say.&rdquo;  Well, come time to write the check and the purse strings get yanked by the partner who wasn&rsquo;t there.  The absent partner typically resents the one who makes the decision just for doing so without him or her; even if they don&rsquo;t realize it they feel left out.  Or, they may not understand the value of taking this action because they weren&rsquo;t there to hear it directly from the financial advisor. This can stall or even destroy progress.</p><p> <strong>  4. Fingerpointing.  </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s say that you meet with a financial advisor and the two of you, without your partner present, decide to go forward with a certain investment in your kid&rsquo;s 529 plan.  The next day the market crashes and you end up having to explain to your spouse why you now you can only afford half the years of college that you could have if you had left the money in a checking account.  Think you&rsquo;ll be sleeping on the couch tonight?</p><p> <strong>  5. What if the big bus comes? </strong></p><p> The wife says, &ldquo;My husband is the one who handles money. I don&rsquo;t have to be involved in the meeting.&rdquo;  Well, if the big bus comes unexpectedly and he passes, she&rsquo;s left without a clue about anything more than how much she has in her checking account.

{"original_id":5387,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Pass Along Feedback to Your Writers","link":"how-to-pass-along-feedback-to-your-writers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The dance takes place every day in marketing departments throughout the financial services industry. Drafts of marketing materials are circulated to key stakeholders for comments. Updates are made, more reviews take place and then, at some point, the cycle concludes and the pieces are signed off.</p><p> How smoothly the review process runs hinges largely on how feedback is gathered and disseminated to your writers.</p><p> Full disclosure: This post takes a writer&rsquo;s angle on feedback, so the perspective will be skewed for sure. If you&rsquo;re a marketing manager or in another role where you pass along feedback to writers, please be sure to send along your challenges and experiences and we&rsquo;ll be happy to share.</p><h3> Feedback comes in many forms</h3><p> <br/> First off, reviewers of marketing materials work in different parts of the company: from product, sales and marketing to legal, compliance, investments and more. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that everyone has a different way to provide feedback. We&rsquo;ve seen it all over the years:</p><li> Tracked changes or blackline edits</li><li> Comment boxes in the document</li><li> Edits appearing in different colours</li><li> Copy revisions made using the &ldquo;text highlight&rdquo; feature</li><li> Handwritten changes of varying legibility</li><li> List of comments via email, a phone call, fax or in person</li><li> Sticky notes plastered onto hard copies</li><li> Insert your favourite method here <br/>  </li><p> Needless to say, the review and feedback process can easily derail if it&rsquo;s not managed effectively.</p><h3> Compiling vs. consolidating</h3><p> <br/> One way to provide feedback is to compile it. In this case, a marketing manager circulates drafts and then sends all edited documents to the writer.</p><p> Some marketing managers will take it a step further and compile all the feedback into one document. That&rsquo;s closer to what a writer needs, and it can position the marketing manager as the true &ldquo;point person&rdquo; on the project. We believe that the most efficient way to move feedback to the writer is through consolidation, not compilation. Why? Sometimes reviewers provide conflicting comments.</p><p> For example, someone might write, &ldquo;This sentence would be great in the intro. Move it there.&rdquo; Another reviewer might say, &ldquo;This sentence belongs in the close. Move it there.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s a writer to do? The marketing manager can weigh in and decide how to direct the writer.</p><h3> One more example to consider</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes reviewers pose questions. There may even be a running debate as different points of view are aired. It may not productive for the writer to sift through these unanswered questions in order to figure out next steps. This is where the marketing manager can step in, meet with or call the reviewers involved, and resolve any outstanding issues before the consolidated feedback goes to the writer.</p><p> It takes and strong team and a locked-down process to produce the strongest, most compelling marketing materials possible in an efficient manner. And this is a great opportunity for marketing managers to shine.

{"original_id":5388,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Learning to Embrace Silence Can Do Wonders for Your Sales","link":"learning-to-embrace-silence-can-do-wonders-for-your-sales","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We&rsquo;ve written about the importance of listening in sales before. In fact, any sales trainer who isn&rsquo;t a complete phony will tell you that listening is the most important skill a salesperson can develop.</p><p> They say you have two ears and one mouth for a reason, but why is it so difficult for many (if not most) salespeople to deal with more than a few seconds of silence? In fact, studies suggest that after asking a question, the average salesperson waits no longer than 2-3 seconds before rephrasing the question, answering it themselves, or changing the topic.</p><p> Learning to embrace silence can do wonders for your sales career. A salesperson who is able to ask questions and keep their mouth shut long enough to listen to the answers will see immediate success, and along with tools like  <a href=\"https://spirohq.com/home/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Spiro, your personal sales assistant </a> , will be a step ahead of their competitors.</p><p> Here are five reasons why salespeople should stop talking immediately.</p><h3> 1. Silence is powerful</h3><p> <br/> Silence can be a very powerful tool. It&rsquo;s so powerful that most people can&rsquo;t stand more than a few seconds of it in conversation for fear of an awkward moment, too much tension, or just because of how foreign it feels. Very rarely will you lose a customer by letting them speak &ndash; but you can easily lose a customer by talking too much. Embrace silence, learn to thrive in it, and watch your sales numbers shoot up.</p><h3> 2. The customer will tell you everything you need to know</h3><p> <br/> Salespeople frequently make the mistake of believing that they already know everything they need to know to sell their customers a product. But what better way to find out how to close a customer than letting them tell you themselves?! Ask the right questions and then let the prospect speak until they have nothing else to say. And then ask another question, and so on. Sooner or later the customer will tell you what need they&rsquo;re trying to solve, and then you can custom-tailor your pitch accordingly.</p><h3> 3. You&rsquo;ll satisfy a natural human desire</h3><p> <br/> Human beings love when you listen to them. Especially in today&rsquo;s fast paced world, where getting the person you&rsquo;re talking to to look up at you from their phone for more than a few seconds seems like an accomplishment. Those who have mastered the art of listening and being patient are providing something that&rsquo;s becoming harder and harder to find. Think about the average person. They probably don&rsquo;t get listened to at work, they don&rsquo;t get listened to at home, and they definitely don&rsquo;t get listened to by politicians. If you can satisfy that basic human need, you&rsquo;re much more likely to get their business.</p><h3> 4. You&rsquo;ll stop sounding like a salesperson</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve written about  <a href=\"https://spirohq.com/stop-sounding-like-a-sales-person/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  why you should stop sounding like a salesperson </a>  before (because it doesn&rsquo;t work), and learning to listen better will help you get there. The public thinks the stereotypical salesperson is fast-talking, pushy, and only cares about closing deals. The best way to counter that narrative is to do the exact opposite. Listen twice as much as you speak, make the prospect feel important and listened to, and when it comes time to close the deal you will both feel like you&rsquo;ve arrived at an agreement together.</p><h3> 5. Because your competitors probably won&rsquo;t</h3><p> <br/> As mentioned earlier, the average salesperson will only wait a few seconds after asking a question before talking. This gives anyone who has mastered the art of listening a major advantage over their competitors. Let&rsquo;s face it, most people have a very hard time changing their behavior, and bad listening skills can be one of the toughest communication habits to break. If you&rsquo;re on a call, try covering your mouth when there is a moment of silence, or if you&rsquo;re in person, count to ten in your head before interjecting with a follow-up question or comment. But whatever you do, stop talking immediately.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-02 15:14:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-02 15:14:27.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_jiwgt4Y.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/learning-to-embrace-silence-can-do-wonders-for-your-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"11493\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-02 15:14:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-02 15:14:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"learning-to-embrace-silence-can-do-wonders-for-your-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11492\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5610\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Learning-to-Embrace-Silence-Can-Do-Wonders-for-Your-Sales.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"944\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464944400,"author_id":2,"chart_url":""}

(Get your copy <a href=\"http://content.schwab.com/email/as/advisornews/08_26_2015/articles/feature0815.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a> <a href=\"http://content.schwab.com/email/as/advisornews/08_26_2015/articles/feature0815.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> <a href=\"http://content.schwab.com/email/as/advisornews/08_26_2015/articles/feature0815.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  . </a> )\"More than half of the RIA firms in the study are now embarking on their third decade in business and the data shows that they are doing so from a position of competitive strength,\" says Jonathan Beatty, senior vice president, sales and relationship management, Schwab Advisor Services.\"As RIAs and the industry-at-large continue to mature, firms are learning from each other and sharing best practices to help build scale and fuel growth. The independent model is clearly winning today among high net worth investors, and RIAs are also preparing themselves to capture future opportunities.\" <strong>  1. Prioritizing Growth </strong> According to Schwab, leading RIAs invested, on average, 2.4% of their revenue on marketing and business development activities: working on marketing plans, improving the sales process, and developing centers of influence.A recent survey by  <a href=\"http://www.benefitspro.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BenefitsPro  </a> mirrored the Schwab report regarding priorities. &ldquo;38% of RIAs said they would put them toward growth, while 25% said they would invest first in technology. That&rsquo;s far ahead of any other concerns: just 13% said their top priority is employee and talent management, 12% thought client service could use that extra investment money, 8% said it should be operations and processes.&rdquo; Just 4% thought compliance warranted a top priority.Size matters, too. Growth is an even bigger priority for RIAs that manage between $10 million and $100 million in assets &mdash; 45% of those put growth at the top of their priorities, according to BenefitsPro.The survey also showed where RIAs felt confident adding value. &ldquo;76% of respondents cited retirement planning, 69% said it&rsquo;s in growing assets, 59% picked protecting wealth, and 56% said wealth transfer.&rdquo; By contrast, only 39% were confident of their ability to assist with elder care planning.Demographics matters, too. The BenefitsPro survey found that baby boomers primarily wanted retirement advice, Gen Xers wanted to know how to pay for their kids&rsquo; school, and millennials were most concerned with taxes and buying real estate. <strong>  2. Differentiation </strong> How RIAs differentiate remains a key to success, as always -  based on demographics, occupation, or interests. A few ways RIAs key in on specific personas:  <a href=\"http://www.heronfinancialgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Heron Financial Group </a>  primarily counsels business owners, attorneys, and corporate executives; Jeff Rose, CFP, Founder of  <a href=\"http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Good Financial Cents </a> , caters to Generation X and Generation Y investors; and Brittany Castro, CFP, and founder of  <a href=\"http://www.financiallywisewomen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Financially Wise Women </a> , focuses on, well, can you guess? <strong>  3. Social Media </strong> Social media - LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+, Instagram - may likely continue rapid adaptation by many advisors.  <a href=\"https://serebrinpartners.com/single-post/2015/12/10/Is-Social-Media-Worth-46-Million-in-Asset-Growth-for-RIAs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Can social media impact ROI? </a>  While difficult to pinpoint, the answer is generally yes. &ldquo;Social media is the force multiplier of a really good marketing program.,&rdquo; said David Edwards, founder of Heron Financial Group. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have a good marketing plan, having a good social media platform won&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;As for compliance concerns, some firms may have an extensive checklist of dos and don'ts. Primary among them: don&rsquo;t recommend specific securities or mutual funds to buy or sell; don&rsquo;t use client testimonials; don't use words like promise or guarantee; and do archive all social media communications. <strong>  4. Recruiting </strong> &ldquo;One in four firms (26%)&rdquo; according to Schwab, said &ldquo;Recruiting is among their top priorities in 2015 with an eye toward increasing a firm's skill set and capabilities. In particular, firms are bringing in professional management in order to better manage the challenges associated with increased operational complexity.Firms in the Schwab study reported &ldquo;Recruiting to add skill and increase capacity\" to be the third highest priority among strategic initiatives for the year ahead.&rdquo; Most RIAs were looking to hire for growth positions: 76% of firms planned to add either relationship managers or investment professionals. And &ldquo;10% of firms sought to add 'dedicated management' to focus on running business operations, which can add capacity for other professionals to focus on client service and new business development.&rdquo; <strong>  5. Optimizing Client Referral Strategies </strong> Cloning the best clients has been and remains a priority for most RIAs, and why not? According to a 2014 study by Investment News, up to 50% of new assets under management for RIAs came from current clients. In general, the larger the firm, the better they were at optimizing referrals. 68% of firms with $10 million or more in annual revenue had a formalized referal process; 52% of firms with up to $5 million in revenue had a process in place to gather referrals; and on average only 43% of RIAs had a process for gaining referrals. <strong>  6. Fee Compression </strong> Fees continue to go one way, generally lower, thanks mostly to new entrants seeking the industries' high margins, and to the rise of the robo advisor. &ldquo;Average asset-weighted fees shrank from 46 basis points in 2006 to 39 in 2012, according to Casey, Quirk &amp; Associates, a Connecticut-based investment management consulting firm.According to Institutional Investor, &ldquo;The good news for advisers is that the very wealthy aren&rsquo;t so price-sensitive. We have seen an increasing trend among mass-affluent investors to shift toward fee-only advisers but also to make lowering the total fees paid the most significant part of the selection process. Once the investible assets rise above $2 million, however, we see fees become less important than factors such as service level and investment performance.&rdquo; <strong>  7. Robo Advisors </strong> By way of definition, the CFA Institute defines a robo-adviser &ldquo;as an adviser that exclusively leverages software to service a client, whereas a traditional RIA setup involves a human being delivering guidance to a client.&rdquo;Are robo-advisors a challenge, or a potential benefit to RIAs? Wesley Gray, PhD, Founder of  <a href=\"http://www.alphaarchitect.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Alpha Architect </a> , has outlined this scenario:&rdquo;Consider the case of John Doe, a financial adviser who is providing investment management services. Let&rsquo;s say John is sitting in his office one day, and he gets two emails. The first email is from Bill Baby Boomer, who has $1,000,000 to manage, and the second email is from Mark Millennial, who has $10,000 he wants managed.&ldquo;John can charge Bill 1.00% on the $1,000,000, which means John will earn $10,000 in fees every year. This compensates him for the time he would spend managing Bill&rsquo;s portfolio. The situation with Mark is more problematic. If John charges a 1.00% fee on Mark&rsquo;s portfolio, he will only earn $100. John cannot justify opening an account for Mark because he can&rsquo;t cover the fixed costs of his time.For John to justify an advisory relationship with Mark, he would need to charge him upwards of 5% or perhaps 10% of assets, which would equate to $500 to $1,000 in annual fees, or one tenth the fees generated by Bill&rsquo;s account. In effect, Mark&rsquo;s lack of assets shuts him out of the financial advice market.&ldquo;With robo-advisers, Mark is back in the game. Asset allocation, tax efficiency, and other high net worth &ldquo;classics&rdquo; can now be provided to all consumers. Robo-advisers are creating a lot of value, and it is the customer, not the adviser, who is capturing the lion&rsquo;s share of it.&rdquo; <strong>  8. Maintaining High Operating Margins </strong> According the Schwab 2015 study, &ldquo;Operating margins are a key component of the RIA success story. Over the past five years, the standardized operating margin for top-performing firms has risen from 19% to 38%, but as more firms employ best practices and operate with greater discipline, the median standardized operating margin has increased 36% over the last five years, reaching 27% at the median for 2014, up from 20% in 2010.&rdquo; <strong>  9. Cybersecurity </strong> The SEC has focused on potential cyber attacks, and so should RIAs. According toInvestment News, \"Cybersecurity policies should be designed to protect the firm's networks and information. They also should address how the RIA will deal with the risks related to remote customer access, as well as funds transfer requests.\" The cost of a cyber attack on client information - in trust, dollars, and reputation would be too coslty to calculate. <strong>  10. Succession Planning </strong> Many advisory firms have been more concerned with growth than with succession. Continued success, however, creates long-term succession and exit planning issues.Rob Thompson, founder of  <a href=\"http://www.trucorebd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TruCore Business Development </a>  in Houston, TX, first asks advisors:  &ldquo;Have you identified a successor, such as a partner, family member, or externally? If you have partners, do you have a buy-sell agreement in place? Does it cover multiple triggering events, such as death, disability, bankruptcy, and retirement?&rdquo;Mr. Thompson also asks advisors &ldquo;Do you know the current market value of your business? Do you know how to calculate its value? How much equity and/or control are you willing to relinquish? Will your succession plan ensure sufficient income and liquidity when you retire?&rdquo;In structuring the transition, Mr. Thompson asks RIAs to &ldquo;Consider whether the purchase will involve cash, equity, notes, or a mix of assets.

{"original_id":5390,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Digital Transformation in Education: From Challenge to Opportunity","link":"digital-transformation-in-education-from-challenge-to-opportunity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Technology is changing the way society communicates, collaborates and learns.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation\" target=\"_blank\">  Digital transformation </a>  is not a fleeting trend or hype. It is a societal revolution that causes unavoidable change for any industry. Organisations often see the digital challenge as a struggle to keep up with the latest technology. An unfortunate mindset, because it is much more than that. The digital transformation in the current information revolution is actually a wave of changes that enable people to grow and adjust. For the education branch it is an opportunity to improve learning methods, attract bright minds and meet learners&rsquo; expectations.</p><h3> Data: knowing the individual requirements</h3><p> <br/> The main problem within education institutions and learning organisations is unlocking data. Student data is often maintained in silo&rsquo;s, requiring too much time and effort to make them available for any interested party. Technology should supplement the experience for both teachers and learners. Due to the insights that can be retrieved from student behaviours, organisations can deliver a more personalised learning experience and improve student engagement. To achieve this, IT departments need to be able to deliver on the demands of this tech-savvy generation.</p><p> Demographical and technological matters play a crucial role in the student learning experience and the market competition. The digital transformation is allowing to bridge the widening gap between increased learner expectations and funding, that is for the most part collected through tuition fees. The  <a href=\"https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/api/digital-transformation-higher-education\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  best practise case from MIT </a>  gives useful insights on how one could harness digital transformation. It describes how institutions like MIT, the University of San Diego, and the University of Oklahoma are delivering technology solutions faster these days. The bottom line is, that in order to meet demands and fight competition, educational institutions need to create a network infrastructure that connects all their data systems, unlocking reusable data via a single platform and increasing productivity.</p><h3> Network infrastructure:  Connecting data, applications and devices</h3><p> <br/> Connectivity is an important pillar in the learner&rsquo;s demands package. For a lot of institutions and organisations this is the complicated backbone of the digital transformation. Legacy IT services need to be modernised and made adoptional to multiple stakeholders and multi-faceted technology needs. Students, administrators, learning &amp; development departments within organisations and faculty staff within educational institutions. All of these target groups should be empowered to gain leverage that represents growth and evolution.</p><p> When innovative API-led applications can be connected easily with a single platform for all the necessary data, every department will be enabled to have their own custom solutions built, making learning services accessible for everyone. Solutions can vary from enough bandwidth, financial management systems to online learning platforms. The globalisation of higher education for instance increases competition at top universities worldwide. Technology can help them to differentiate from their peers, creating a healthy competitive education market that drives innovation. Same goes for learning organisations.</p><p> One can only build and thrive on the cloud, mobility and other technologies when the right network infrastructure is in place. For IT departments this means a different role: less controlling data and more governing and providing self-serve access in order to deal with current demands.</p><h3> Learning anytime and anywhere</h3><p> <br/> With the right network in place, mobile and online learning are becoming more and more important in higher and adult education. Students want to be in control of how they learn, and especially of what they learn and when. The new generation wants to focus on the change in mindset they need to achieve and the skills they need to develop. Most of all they want to be agile in doing so.</p><p> In this perspective, online and mobile technology are important enablers. They both offer platforms for techniques like micro learning and social learning; effective tools to create the required learning experience.</p><p> Micro learning is characterised by small learning units and short-term learning activities.  With shorter, more concentrated bursts of content offered on an online platform, people can study anywhere they want on the device they prefer.</p><p> Same goes for social learning, which is based on the idea that we model and imitate the behaviour of others through observation and feedback. In other words, not absorbing knowledge from books but learning from peers. Take for instance  <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TEdX programmes </a> , inspirational learning by storytelling and sharing experiences.</p><p> The   <a href=\"http://power-app.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  PowerApp </a>  of learning organisation Bright Alley in the Netherlands is another great example that merges both techniques. This application provides learners with small pieces of personalised content based on the need to know knowledge. Also it provides people with easy feedback tools through gamification. An excellent way to keep employees up to par.</p><p> Other e-learning examples that have been upcoming the last decade are MOOC&rsquo;s (Massive Open Online Courses) or SPOC&rsquo;s (Small Private Online Course). Developing these online learning solutions is no rocket science anymore. At least not the technological part; setting up an effective course still requires the knowledge and skills of a learning professional. But user-friendly software, like open-source  <a href=\"https://moodle.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  learning platform Moodle </a> , make creating learning solutions more accessible and payable for almost any organisation or educational institution.</p><h3> Thrive or hardly survive</h3><p> <br/> Digital transformation is not going away. While other industries have been radically enhanced by advanced digital technologies in the last decade, the education industry has barely changed. Evaluating digital transformation readiness is essential to identify challenges and embrace the possibilities. Not applying them to step into the next level, won&rsquo;t stop competitors from causing a disruption that threatens the business .  It is time for education to learn!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-02 15:57:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-02 15:57:26.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ppo6sre.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/digital-transformation-in-education-from-challenge-to-opportunity/\", \"post_id\": \"11497\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-02 15:57:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-02 15:57:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"digital-transformation-in-education-from-challenge-to-opportunity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11496\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5612\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Digital-Transformation-in-Education-From-Challenge-to-Opportunity.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"730\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464976800,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5391,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are Your Clients Emotionally Unavailable?","link":"are-your-clients-emotionally-unavailable","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <b>  Are you customers emotional about your brand? your products?  </b> ... or are they emotionally unavailable? <br/> <br/> <b>  Emotion  </b> is the big buzzword in customer experience right now; it's all the rage. Here's what some customer experience folks are saying about it. <br/> <br/> Temkin Group proclaimed 2016  <a href=\"https://experiencematters.wordpress.com/intensify-emotion-positive-feelings-create-loyal-customers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Year of Emotion </a> . They reported that, out of three factors that impact customer loyalty and drive the customer experience, emotion has the most significant impact.  <br/> <br/> Michael Hinshaw, CEO of McorpCX,  <a href=\"http://www.cmo.com/opinion/articles/2014/3/11/customer_experience_.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  states </a>  that  <i>  the gap between the expectation of an experience and the perception of the experience actually received is what drives experiences and the emotions that attach to them </i> . He also acknowledges that emotions are a key driver of the customer experience and that the customer experience really boils down to how customers feel about the brand and the experience. <br/> <br/> Forrester found that  <i>  how customers feel about their experiences with a firm can damage &ndash; or improve &ndash; their perception of the overall experience and the brand </i> . As such, measuring emotions becomes a business imperative. <br/> <br/> In a recent  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/11/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Harvard Business Review article </a> , Scott Magids et al wrote:  <i>  Our research across hundreds of brands in dozens of categories shows that it&rsquo;s possible to rigorously measure and strategically target the feelings that drive customers&rsquo; behavior. We call them &ldquo;emotional motivators.&rdquo; They provide a better gauge of customers&rsquo; future value to a firm than any other metric, including brand awareness and customer satisfaction, and can be an important new source of growth and profitability </i> . <br/> <br/> So, it seems that we need to pay attention to customer emotions, for sure. How do your customers feel about your brand? Are they passionate? Are they happy to do business with you? Do they have an emotional connection to your brand's purpose and what you stand for? <br/> <br/> What happens when you have customers who are emotionally unavailable? What happens when they don't or can't emotionally connect with your brand? <br/> <br/> Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who is emotionally unavailable? Yea, no fun. A bit one-sided, right? A bit gung ho and fast and furious at first, and then things fizzled out a bit? <br/> <br/> How can you tell if your customers are emotionally unavailable? They are...</p><li> emotionally distant or feel no emotional connection to your brand</li><li> always trying to avoid dealing with emotions</li><li> unable to deal with their feelings and any emotional repercussions. You want a relationship with this customer? You think she's going to tell you how she feels about your brand? Ha!</li><li> already in a relationship with a competitor - ouch!</li><li> the best customer at first; then, after a honeymoon period, they do a 180</li><li> not \"relationship people\" and can't commit to your brand</li><li> not able to introduce, er, recommend, you to their friends and family</li><li> never happy to talk about their relationships; they'll never mention you to anyone</li><li> elusive, sneaky, and may disappear for periods of time</li><li> always making empty promises - their actions and their words don&rsquo;t match; have they told you they'll be back, and now you're wondering where they went?</li><li> self-centered, i.e., what's in it for me? what about me? what have you done for me lately?</li><li> often throwing you emotional crumbs or hints that they are interested, and then they withdraw</li><li> perfectionists, always looking for some fatal flaw or character defect that gives them permission to leave you - sound familiar?</li><li> all too happy to complain about their past brand relationships. They denigrate the brand with which they were previously in a \"relationship.\" When they left that company, it wasn't because of their own actions or a problem they created; it was the company's fault.</li><li> not easily inconvenienced, inflexible, and hate to compromise. Don't make them accept any alternatives you may offer! They want what they want!</li><li> the relationship, i.e., relationships revolve around them, not around or about you</li><li> often going out of their way to sabotage said relationship</li><li> dishonest</li><li> not arguers. They don't like to engage in argument and walk away whenever the conversation turns heated.</li><li> never around. If she isn't there physically - even just browsing in your store or on your website - then clearly she can't be there emotionally either.</li><li> difficult to communicate with</li><li> in a state of denial and not able or willing to deal with real feelings <br/>  </li><p> That type of customer can certainly make  <i>  you  </i> feel pretty unloved and unwanted. Seems pretty impossible to overcome these characteristics. Maybe there's something to the fact that not all customers are for you. And, definitely, you're not for all customers. <br/> <br/> Or maybe there's something to the fact that customers don't want \"relationships\" with brands? And yet companies still try to achieve that status with all customers. <br/> <br/> We do know that companies try to connect with customers on an emotional level. Have you seen any good Super Bowl ads lately? Did they tug at your heart strings? And did they make you want to buy? Hmm, good question. That's another story, right? That's a marketing story. <br/> <br/> That's not a customer experience story, though. In customer experience stories, actions speak louder than words. How did you make customers feel during their last transaction or interaction? <br/> <br/> So now what? Why did I put that list together? Well, sometimes it's OK to remove certain individuals from your \"customer\" list. Stop sending them emails. Stop trying to sell to them. Stop wasting your time. Move on and focus on those customers that are emotionally available. Move on to the ones that are passionate about your brand. Move on to those customers who want to be in a relationship with you. <br/> <br/> How do you ensure that you connect with them on an emotional level? </p><li> <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/04/what-does-it-mean-to-do-right.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Do right </a>  by them. </li><li> Be honest and fair. </li><li> Conduct all interactions with integrity. </li><li> Instill trust and confidence always, in all ways.</li><li> Show your commitment to the customer. </li><li> Always use  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2016/05/should-you-feel-empathy-or-sympathy-or.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  sympathy and empathy </a>  when there's an issue. </li><li> Treat your customers like humans - not the account numbers with which you tend to associate them. <br/>  </li><p> Actions speak louder than words. Always. Want to connect with customers on an emotional level? Stick with this list. Do what you say you're going to do or what you committed to do. Understand me and what makes me tick; don't focus so much on what makes you tick ($$). <br/> <br/> <i>  The only way to change someone's mind is to connect with them from the heart </i> . -Rasheed Ogunlaru</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-02 15:57:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-02 15:57:27.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_QsTtla2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-your-clients-emotionally-unavailable/\", \"post_id\": \"11499\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-02 15:57:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-02 15:57:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-your-clients-emotionally-unavailable\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11498\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5613\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-Your-Clients-Emotionally-Unavailable.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"557\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464958800,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5392,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Personal Learning Plan — What It Is and Why You Need One","link":"the-personal-learning-plan-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-one","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Self directed learning is probably the least appreciated career skill out there. If you want to advance in your career and certainly if you have hopes of getting to the executive level, you need to build learning into your daily routine. In this blog, I outline the Learning Calendar which is a tool i introduced in my book,  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/new-page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Stealing the Corner Office </a> . </p><p> The Learning Calendar is a tool I use to force myself to actually work on broadening my skill set. It&rsquo;s closely connected to many of the other tools I reference in my  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/new-page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  book </a> . Without a Learning Calendar I find it too easy to de-prioritize this vital aspect of my career plan. It is not enough to build deeper expertise in a single subject matter area either. Being a specialist doesn&rsquo;t lead to career advancement &ndash; career security perhaps &ndash; but definitely not advancement.</p><p> It&rsquo;s vital to document your learning curriculum and agenda at least a month at time and to align it to your promotion and influence plans. I like to start by selecting three themes for the quarter and focus in on one per month. At least two of the three learning themes will be outside my established area of expertise.</p><p> The tendency is to keep going deeper and deeper into subjects we&rsquo;re already good at. It&rsquo;s easier that way, but it&rsquo;s a mistake. If you&rsquo;re already an expert in pricing models, don&rsquo;t invest your valuable time becoming the world&rsquo;s greatest pricing guy &ndash; it won&rsquo;t pay off for you in the end. How many CEO&rsquo;s out there were promoted to the top because they were pricing experts? So if you have pricing expertise already I suggest focusing your learning themes on adjacent areas like licensing, channel models, distribution mechanics. This way you are broadening your skill set within adjacent subjects and painting an image of someone who could manage larger team and hold wider accountabilities. By building this broader set of skills and creating an image of competency around several subject you&rsquo;ll get shortlisted for more promotion opportunities which ultimately will translate to advancement for you.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve identified the learning themes you&rsquo;re going to tackle for the quarter and connected them to your promotion goals, the next step is to actually assign time to learning. This is harder than it sounds. In my experience many managers actually assign zero time to skill set expansion because they are so burdened by delivering on objectives and completing short term projects. So you have to find a way to force yourself to learn something every day that will improve your skill set. I like to do this first thing in the morning because I have more energy and I can find fewer excuses not to do it. I&rsquo;ll set aside 30 minutes each morning to read up on my subject themes. If I&rsquo;m particularly busy or tired I&rsquo;ll watch videos or listen to podcasts instead. I recommend setting up your blog RSS feed with the top bloggers in each subject area you&rsquo;re pursuing. You&rsquo;ll have a permanent library of reference material for as long as you need it.</p><p> The last point to make with respect to the Learning Calendar is that you need to tell people you&rsquo;re doing it. Learning and not telling people about it is pointless for you career strategy. Sure it&rsquo;s great to broaden your skill set but if nobody knows, you&rsquo;ll just be the smartest low level manager in your company.

{"original_id":5393,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Should Give Dividends Your Undivided Attention","link":"why-you-should-give-dividends-your-undivided-attention","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Just as a famous artist can have an influence beyond their chosen genre of art and beyond the arts entirely, the world of finance can see the influence of a particular metric or practice reverberate far beyond its initial purpose. As we look at the world of smart beta as a wave into the future, it makes sense to examine the role that dividend indexes played in popularizing smart beta and note how relevant these still are today.</p><p> Dividend indexes are comprised of public companies that pay dividends to shareholders. It was dividend-paying companies that were the focus of the earliest smart beta index funds.</p><p> There were good reasons why dividend stocks were a leading driver of early-stage smart beta indexes, and these same factors hold true today. Keeping track of what stocks are paying dividends and how they are positioned in the market is an essential step for getting a handle on equities and making sure you can leverage the market with the highest efficiency. The arguments that propelled dividend stocks into the early stages of smart beta still hold true today:</p><p> <strong>  Companies that distribute dividends tend to be better managed and more stable. </strong>  </p><p> Those companies that are in a position to distribute cash payments to its equity owners are typically companies that have reached a certain size and are able to leverage their critical mass and stability in order to take care of its shareholders. If a company is trying to expand rapidly or finds itself in the middle of a reorganization, it will likely not be able to pay dividends. That rapid growth is good, but it comes at the cost of a sharp increase in risk.</p><p> <strong>  Dividends can clue an investor into the very basic value of the company. </strong>  </p><p> A stock trading below its value is a valuable one to have in a long-term portfolio, and discerning true value via dividends can help investors ferret out those stocks that may be punching below their weight today but show the promise of great gains in the not-to-distant future. A time-tested method of valuing a stock is the  <a href=\"http://dividendmonk.com/dividend-discount-model/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dividend Discount Model </a> , which uses projected company dividends to calculate what shares are actually worth.</p><p> <strong>  Dividend stocks are a haven from volatility. </strong>  </p><p> Investors tend to gravitate to dividend-paying stocks when there is increased volatility in the fixed income markets. But the fixed income market today is not the safe haven it once was, with volatile conditions becoming more commonplace than ever. Not only are rising interest rates making corporate debt more cumbersome for issuers but lower oil prices, slowdown in manufacturing in China and continued Middle Eastern strife all indicate that fixed income volatility will likely not abate this year. This makes dividend stocks one of the safest asset classes in which to park capital.</p><p> <strong>  Long-term investors often prefer them. </strong>  </p><p> Because dividend stocks are more stable and often household names with market-dominant positions, they attract long-term investors. These investors are not going to cash out at the first sign of volatility but are holding on to these stocks for the long haul, oftentimes within a retirement portfolio. In other words, you will be in good company.</p><p> <strong>  Dividends account for large portion of market returns. </strong>  </p><p> For the ten years ending December 31, 2015, over 40% of the 110% return that the Nasdaq US Large Mid Cap Index experienced was due to dividends. Put another way, almost half of the returns experienced by large and mid-cap US securities over the last ten years were derived from dividends.</p><p> All this being the case, it is important not to view dividend stocks as a panacea to all your volatility qualms. There is no perfect investment to hedge against volatility&mdash;volatility will always be in the market. Just as any other security, dividend-paying stocks are worth looking at with a skeptical eye, taking into account all the potential drawbacks. Even with all of these caveats in mind, the dividend-paying stock world is still a smart hedge in the face of volatility.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s not look at them as a replacement of a well-diversified portfolio but as a good guide and necessary component of these practices. There&rsquo;s a reason they have been around so long and continue to be a foundation for new smart beta indexes going forward. In times when financial products are coming onto the market at a faster clip, it pays to look back at the roots of smart beta investing and keep dividend-stock indexes at the top of your mind.</p><p> For more information,  <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/GIG_ContactUs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  contact us </a>  and a member of our team will reach out to you directly.</p><p>  </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-02 17:01:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-02 17:01:16.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_UnA8TYZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-should-give-dividends-your-undivided-attention/\", \"post_id\": \"11503\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-02 17:01:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-02 17:01:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-should-give-dividends-your-undivided-attention\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11502\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5615\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-You-Should-Give-Dividends-Your-Undivided-Attention.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"908\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464940800,"author_id":360,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5394,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Steps for Responding to Negative Employee Feedback","link":"7-steps-for-responding-to-negative-employee-feedback","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s more than likely that improving employee engagement is at the top of your to-do list. Deloitte&rsquo;s Human Capital Trends 2015 report found that the number one priority for HR professionals around the globe was culture and engagement.Of course, we know that nothing gets at the heart of this issue like the best tool for measuring it &mdash; employee engagement surveys. If you&rsquo;re planning to check in with your workforce, kudos to you, but be prepared that the results may not always paint a rosy picture of what&rsquo;s going on inside your organization.When faced with negative feedback, it&rsquo;s tempting to do nothing &mdash; or take broad, overarching steps that totally reverse course on what you&rsquo;ve been doing. Resist the temptation, especially with the former approach. Not acting on a survey may cause greater damage to employee engagement than not taking a survey in the first place.A  <a href=\"https://blessingwhite.com/employee-engagement-research-report-update-jan-2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BlessingWhite </a>  survey discovered the following:</p><li> 27% of employees reported being engaged when their company took no action to support employee engagement</li><li> This number drops to 24% for employees who took a survey with no follow-up</li>There&rsquo;s also more at stake than just increased disengagement, including employee turnover. Consider also what a <a href=\"http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=1%2f24%2f2013&amp;id=pr735&amp;ed=12%2f31%2f2013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> CareerBuilder survey</a> found:<li> 48% employees would stay with a company that asks them what they want and puts that feedback into action</li>The best way to respond to negative feedback is with clear, actionable goals, not all of which have to be big shake-ups. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/23956/what-employee-survey-results.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gallup</a>, which has studied employee engagement for decades, notes, &ldquo;Employees expect and need resolution, and one of the best ways to do this is through action planning.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s a process in which organizations first discuss survey results, then identify specific issues to target for overall improvement. Focus on what employees have told you isn&rsquo;t working, take specific steps, and you might just turn lemons into lemonade.Here&rsquo;s a seven-step game plan you can follow when dealing with negative survey results:<h3> <strong>  1. Communicate </strong></h3>Don&rsquo;t hide survey results, even if they reveal widespread dissatisfaction, or the results appear embarrassing. Keeping the feedback away from employees only deepens any mistrust that may already exist.Share the survey results with employees in a way that highlights both the good and the bad, resisting the urge to put a positive spin on the negative feedback. Acknowledge that there are things you need to work on and, most importantly, be sure to clearly outline the steps you&rsquo;ll be taking to create an action plan.<h3> <strong>  2. Focus </strong></h3>With a barrage of negative feedback, it&rsquo;s easy to get the sense that all the problems have to be solved to improve engagement levels. Doing too much may actually harm your efforts to improve things because it stretches everyone, especially managers, too thin. Instead, select a few key issues to work on.There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all approach to how you choose what to focus on. You can select issues across departments or choose the top problems facing each department. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll be selecting issues that were repeatedly brought up by multiple employees in the survey, problems that could be characterized as systemic.<h3> <strong>  3. Clarify </strong></h3>As you&rsquo;re narrowing down the focus on key issues, it&rsquo;s also important to get clarification from the source. In this case, that&rsquo;s your employees. For example, employees may have said that they&rsquo;re not satisfied with communication from their managers. It would be easy to assume what they&rsquo;re looking for is more communication because they&rsquo;re not getting enough.However, asking employees to put into words what &ldquo;good communication&rdquo; means to them may surprise you. You could find out instead that their dissatisfaction stems from the type of communication they&rsquo;re receiving from their managers rather than the frequency.<h3> <strong>  4. Brainstorm </strong></h3>If you&rsquo;re committed to improvement, you should also be committed to trying new approaches. Conduct a brainstorming process to collect ideas, whether in working groups, as Gallup researchers suggest, or within smaller teams in each specific department.Our <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/resources/employee-engagement-survey-2013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 2013 Employee Engagement Survey</a> found that almost one in five responses from employees on surveys included a suggestion, so be sure to include them in the process. Of course, managers and leadership should bring ideas to the table as well and not expect employees to be the only source for solutions.<h3> <strong>  5. Set goals </strong></h3>Once you have a pool of ideas to draw from, it&rsquo;s time to decide what can be accomplished, and by whom. Clear goals are important because they motivate both frontline employees and leadership to work towards improving the workplace with concrete steps. They&rsquo;re also measurable, so it&rsquo;s easy to assess the process along the way and make changes if necessary.<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/23956/what-employee-survey-results.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gallup researchers note</a>, &ldquo;[A] number of mechanisms need to be in place for goals to make a difference,&rdquo; including communication, agreement, and commitment. Everyone involved needs to buy into the goals, which is only possible in an environment where open discussion is valued, so managers need to regularly facilitate honest conversation around the goals.<h3> <strong>  6. Evaluate </strong></h3>Ideally, you&rsquo;ll be evaluating your action plan along the way, especially once you&rsquo;ve established goals. Still, if you&rsquo;ve made a number of changes across departments, you&rsquo;ll want overall feedback on whether these changes have made a positive difference. That&rsquo;s right &mdash; time for another survey! Now whether this is as all-encompassing as the last one is up to you, but taking another pulse is the best way to get insight into whether the changes you&rsquo;ve made along the way have added up to improving workplace culture and employee engagement.<h3> <strong>  7. Continue </strong></h3>The process doesn&rsquo;t end with another survey. The best workplaces are those where managers and leadership are committed to continuing to work alongside their employees on improving things. Maybe you&rsquo;ve accomplished all the goals you set in your action plan, but there&rsquo;s always something more you can do.Employee surveys are an excellent tool to measure employee engagement, but surveys without follow-up action are useless and could even be detrimental. Negative feedback from a survey can be alarming, perhaps even embarrassing, but the best response is a clear, constructive action plan. Do that, and you&rsquo;ll not just be measuring employee engagement &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be actively supporting it.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-02 17:08:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-02 17:08:20.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_wShgI3F.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-steps-for-responding-to-negative-employee-feedback/\", \"post_id\": \"11505\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-02 17:08:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-02 17:08:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-steps-for-responding-to-negative-employee-feedback\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11504\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5616\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-Steps-for-Responding-to-Negative-Employee-Feedback.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"951\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464973200,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}

Since it is nearly impossible to succeed all alone, here are three keys to really connecting with others.</p><h3> <strong>  Listen authentically </strong></h3><p> <br/> Developing a relationship requires communication. But, the key to connecting with others is the listening side of the communication equation. Listening shows others that you are truly interested in them and what they have to say.

When you engage authentically you find the commonalities that create a sense of community, a sense of connection. Engagement, like listening, shows interest; it allows all parties to get to know each other, to find shared interests, and collaborate to achieve great goals.</p><h3> <strong>  Care authentically </strong></h3><p> <br/> At the end of the day, connection comes down to caring about another person. Not caring about what they have to offer you; not caring about whom they know; not caring about what they do; it&rsquo;s about caring authentically. When you care about others on an individual basis you open the door to real connection.</p><h3> <strong>  Connect authentically </strong></h3><p> <br/> Great things can be accomplished when two or more individuals connect authentically.

It&rsquo;s an idea with merit, but it is not something that can happen overnight. The transformation requires a mindful approach and, even more importantly, a clearer appreciation of the basics of judgment and conscious choice-making.</p><p> Success is largely the product of daily choices, yet many of us are conditioned to believe it is the long-term, big decisions that have the greatest impact. The problem is that individuals and organizations overemphasize performance and leadership development while overlooking the value and impact of cultivating an effective choice-making skillset aligned with defined core values, a prerequisite for strong leadership. In cultures that believe winning is everything, it is imperative that we establish the discipline of making choices that enable us to perform at high levels without compromising our values. The fact of the matter is, our choices do play a role in how our brains develop over time, and our choices play a role in our capacity to be successful. </p><p> While many may argue the amount of free will that an individual possesses, it can also be argued that we do have the ability to exercise a certain amount of our control in the choices we make. The extent to which we can impact our choices depends on how aware we are of the hidden influences that work in the background. Self-doubt has been stated as one of the most paralyzing forces; by shaking out confidence, it can get in the way of taking a position and making a choice.</p><p> Neuroscience has made it clear that our brains can change over time&ndash;&ndash; they are not simply static. This news should bring widespread hope. Our futures aren&rsquo;t written at the moment of birth; nobody is divided into the two fixed categories of the talented and those who will remain without talent for their entire lifetime. </p><p> In plain language, Neuroplasticity is our brain's ability to re-wire itself.  Focusing our attention on certain tasks can actually strengthen our neural circuits over time and make us more capable of executing that task, much like how our muscles can be strengthened at the gym.  In the past, we credited good judgment and success primarily to one&rsquo;s experience.  Today, we realize that the school of trial and error need not be the only teacher we rely on. In fact, even experience can prove to be an ineffective teacher if we don&rsquo;t deliberately choose to reflect on and learn from it. It is possible to harness this new knowledge about how our brains work, and about how we make choices. Once we understand the inner workings of those processes, we can accelerate our experience and improve the quality of our decisions.</p><p> These findings mean that the potential for achievement is available to everyone.  While it technically provides an equal opportunity to all, it does, however, depend on the person's openness to engage in reflection and learning. There is an old adage that goes something like this: \"Dumb people don't learn from their own mistakes; smart people learn from their own mistakes; and wise people learn from other people's mistakes.\" </p><p> Making a commitment towards reflection is the first step to generating realizations. Putting the learnings into practice start with developing some initial practices which can further be developed into habits if appropriately rewarded and approached in a systematic way.  While our human tendency to move toward pleasure and away from pain is usually exploited by marketers for their gain, they can be leveraged to cultivate good habits as well.  Increasing your awareness of your assumptions, beliefs, conditionings and drives is a fundamental step to enhancing achievement while curbing doubt.</p><p> One of the key impediments to achievement that I have noticed over the last 20 years of coaching is one's inability to believe in possibility and succumb to self-doubt.  I have often considered fear and doubt to be the real evils.  My two favorite expansions I have come across for the acronym FEAR are False Experiences Appearing Real and Forget Everything and Run.  What we need is to develop a conditioning that transforms us to believing that FEAR stands for Face Everything and Rise. It is our choice to cultivate the habit of facing our fears and doubts with the firm belief that hard work, coupled with a keen attention to outcomes and feedback, and a willingness to change and try again and again is the key to achievement.</p><p> A great way to live is \"Two Days at a Time\". Ask yourself two questions at the end of each day: \"What did I learn today?\" and \"What can I do different tomorrow?\" Since life is a series of todays and tomorrows, I am confident this philosophy and practice is bound to bear fruit.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-02 18:26:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-02 18:26:29.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_XyOy6Yj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/can-self-doubt-be-the-devil-in-your-life/\", \"post_id\": \"11509\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-02 18:26:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-02 18:26:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"can-self-doubt-be-the-devil-in-your-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11508\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5618\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Can-Self-Doubt-Be-The-Devil-in-Your-Life.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1059\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1464955200,"author_id":285,"chart_url":""}

Or are you a great saver and rarely let money stress you out?</h3><p> <br/> Well it turns out that the genesis of your current beliefs and habits goes all the way back to your childhood.  Your past holds the secret key to unlocking the reasons why you are either stumbling or strutting in your money life.</p><p> I call it your &ldquo;Money Imprint&rdquo;&mdash;the lessons you learned early that formed your hardwired operating system and your &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. And let&rsquo;s face it, we don&rsquo;t question normal very often. </p><p> In fact, if you can decipher those money messages from long ago with your mature, non-child mind, you just might uncover some very helpful insights into your behavior.</p><h3> Think about your earliest memory that concerned money. </h3><p> <br/> Maybe it was putting pennies in a piggy bank, spending your allowance, going with your mom or dad to the bank to open a savings account. What do you first remember about money?</p><h3> And then look to each of your parents. </h3><p> <br/> What lessons did you learn from them? Think carefully, because those lessons may have been buried in day-to-day behavior vs lessons they consciously tried to impress on you. They might have never talked about money at all and you now equate money with secrecy. Or shame. Or they might have dropped casual bombs that made their way into your thinking: &ldquo;Rich people are greedy&rdquo;; &ldquo;Money is the root of all evil&rdquo;; &ldquo;Always look like you have money&rdquo;.</p><h3> What was your experience with money? </h3><p> <br/> Maybe you received an allowance and your family taught you about making savings and spending decisions. Or did you have no allowance and your parents simply provided what they wished you to have? Consider how you interacted with money as you grew up.</p><h3> Did you consider yourself rich, poor or somewhere in between? </h3><p> <br/> Did you feel privileged? Did you feel like your friends, extended family and classmates had way more economic status and comfort? Did that make you feel better or worse than others?</p><h3> Was money a source of conflict or worry? </h3><p> <br/> Was worry a part of your experience growing up? Why? Was their an event that triggered a change&mdash;say a death, divorce or job loss&mdash;or do you recall money always being a source of conflict or worry?</p><p> (For a complete Money Imprint questionnaire from my upcoming new book &ldquo;The Feel Rich Project&rdquo; (Career Press June 2016)  <a href=\"http://www.michaelfkay.com/money-imprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  click here. </a> )  All these experiences imprinted your brain with your beliefs about money and formatted how you operate today. If you grew up with the notion that it&rsquo;s vital to show the world that you are successful, chances are you might spend more than you should in order to live that imprint. If you grew up understanding that money is a tool and that gratification can and should be delayed until an appropriate time in the future, chances are you make decisions that support financial security.</p><p> So does this mean you&rsquo;re stuck with whatever you took away from your past?</p><p> Not hardly.</p><p> When your money beliefs don&rsquo;t support you and your values in the adult world, it&rsquo;s time to construct a new set.</p><p> You start by understanding that just because your child-mind absorbed a message doesn&rsquo;t mean it should be part of your life now.</p><p> Let me show you what I mean.</p><p> Old belief: I use money to show others that I am successful.</p><p> New belief: I use money to create long-term security for my family and me.</p><p> Old belief: Money equals worry.</p><p> New belief: I need to have a better understanding of my money so that I can find peace of mind.</p><p> If your money beliefs have become intensely problematic, you might consider working with a therapist who specializes in Cognitive Behavior Therapy to help you build new habits that support the life you crave.</p><p> Just remember: you are not chained to past beliefs that only serve to prolong and support misery. The ability to make changes lies clearly&mdash;and strongly&mdash;within your power.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-05 17:41:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-05 17:41:15.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_Z8soAQl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-your-childhood-affects-your-money-today/\", \"post_id\": \"11515\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-05 17:41:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-05 17:41:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-your-childhood-affects-your-money-today\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11514\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5621\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-Your-Childhood-Affects-Your-Money-Today.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"681\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465239600,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

If we were to condense  that  sentence further, we&rsquo;d come up with &ldquo;advising is coaching clients to win their own game&rdquo;.</p><p> When we break it down into its simplest language it becomes meaningful to most clients too, as they understand the difference that coaching makes. They&rsquo;ve watched all the champion sports teams, and they&rsquo;ve had coaches themselves at different times in their lives, and they understand mentoring and guidance.  Those things are perceived as valuable by most clients.  &ldquo;Advice&rdquo; on the other hand suggests that perhaps they are about to be &ldquo;told&rdquo;&hellip;and suddenly the dark images of schooldays and being lectured spring to mind &ndash; and who wants to revisit those experiences?</p><p> So when we talk to clients about &ldquo;advising&rdquo; them, it is often perceived negatively initially.  When we talk to clients about coaching it is a far more positive reception, and it also creates a bit of intrigue and interest.  A very successful way of explaining it is with a simple diagram.  The diagram can be shown directly to clients as a wonderful coloured chart of course, but it is more powerful when it is drawn in front of clients as it is explained.  This is how to explain it, and how to position advice properly:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"509\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/succees-planning-coaching.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Pretty much everyone we deal with is on track for some level of success in their life &ndash; with or without us.  They have jobs, will save some money in their retirement accounts, they will buy homes and eventually pay them off&hellip;.the reality is that pretty much every potential client will achieve a level of &ldquo;financial success&rdquo; in their life with or without us.  It is helpful for all concerned if we acknowledge that consumers can actually achieve reasonable outcomes without any particular planning or advisory involvement&hellip;.they&rsquo;ve been doing it for thousands of years before &ldquo;financial advice&rdquo; was dreamed up as a job.</p><p> But equally, we&rsquo;ve known for thousands of years too that  planning  makes a significant difference to success in any field of endeavour.</p><p> When people plan, and focus on their desired goal and then make smarter and more thoughtful decisions about how to allocate their resources, they tend to achieve far higher levels of success.  So we can see that &ldquo;planning&rdquo; makes a significant difference to people&rsquo;s success.  That is true even if it is just the clients themselves engaging in planning of their own.  People with a plan generally will get more of what they want in life than those who live day to day and wait to see what the world will bring to them.</p><p> This is the same difference that exists between a naturally gifted athlete who was going to do well in sport anyway, but achieved so much more when they had a goal and a plan to achieve it.  That same talented and motivated athlete will achieve even higher levels of excellence though once they get expert personal coaching. Great coaching is often the difference between olympians and provincial champions.</p><p> Great coaching brings perspective and focus.  It creates accountability and responsibility.  Individual coaching delivers objectivity, analytical assessment, and teaching of the refinements that make the difference between being an olympian or a local champion.</p><p> Coaching unlocks the full potential of the athlete.  Similarly, great advice unlocks the potential success that clients have.</p><p> To get clients understanding what it is that great financial advisers can deliver it is as simple as showing them that there are levels of success in life.  Many many consumers will achieve the success of a mortgage-free home and some savings by the time they are pushed out of the workforce&hellip;and many will be happy with that achievement.  Others want more, and recognise the power of planning and the difference it makes.</p><p> Champions recognise the need for top level coaching to unleash their potential success.</p><p> Great advisers are great coaches, and unlocking the potential success is what we are all about.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a value proposition for you&hellip;.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-05 18:15:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-05 18:15:13.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_C2mZzot.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-perennial-challenge-in-selling-advice-is-positioning-it-as-valuable-how-to-do-it/\", \"post_id\": \"11518\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-05 18:15:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-05 18:15:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-perennial-challenge-in-selling-advice-is-positioning-it-as-valuable-how-to-do-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11516\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5622\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Perennial-Challenge-in-Selling-Advice-Is-Positioning-It-as-Valuable-How-to-Do-It.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1118\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465272000,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

This approach helped inspire the development of today&rsquo;s ink-jet printers.</p><p> Close&rsquo;s portraits make little sense from a vantage point very near the canvas; the isolated color globs seem random and chaotic. Seeing the whole picture requires stepping back and taking in all the details as a unified work. In a similar manner, we believe investors are well advised to &ldquo;step back&rdquo; and approach dividend-oriented portfolios from an integrated, total return perspective considering both income and capital gains over the long-term. We believe many investors have become overly focused on the &ldquo;tiny dots&rdquo; of today&rsquo;s current yield. Current Yield: The Basics Current yield is a snapshot in time of a company&rsquo;s annual dividends per share divided by its current stock price per share. The resulting data from multiple securities can then be averaged to arrive at the overall current yield of a portfolio. While we view current yield as an important variable to consider, we believe it has become far too common to rely on it as a primary or even sole measure of a dividend-oriented portfolio. Part of this trend may be driven by simplicity; current yield is a data point that is readily available among the information tools used today. As is so often the situation, however, this simplicity can come at a cost&mdash;in this case, potentially lower long-term total return.</p><p> The key danger in overly focusing on current yield, in our view, is that investors can be led to overlook companies that have enjoyed such success that they have been rewarded with stock price increases that equal or outstrip the growth of their rising dividend. That is to say, if the denominator of a company&rsquo;s stock price appreciates at an equivalent or faster rate than the numerator of its dividend, such a situation may put downward pressure on that company&rsquo;s current dividend yield, even if the dividend is growing respectably. We find it detrimental to eliminate positions from a portfolio or exclude companies from research coverage merely due to low current yield. By placing too much emphasis on current yield, we feel total return over the long-term could be compromised due to comparatively weak capital gains.</p><h3> <strong>  Yield-at-Cost: Providing Some Perspective </strong></h3><p> <br/> Given our long-term approach to investing and our partiality to companies with consistent dividend growth, we believe a more effective way to analyze yield is not by utilizing the current yield but rather the &ldquo;yield-at-cost&rdquo; of a portfolio. Yield-at-cost divides a company&rsquo;s current annual dividends per share by the original cost per share basis at which the company was brought into a portfolio. This calculation takes a company&rsquo;s dividend growth into account and doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;penalize&rdquo; a company for stock price appreciation. From our perspective, one of the key insights of a yield-at-cost analysis is that healthy dividend growth may accompany or even lead to stock price appreciation.</p><h3> <strong>  A Real-World Company Example </strong></h3><p> <br/> Exhibit 1 chronicles an example of a dividend growth company and a high-yielding company. Company A shows a relatively low-yielding, but strong dividend growth company. Company B shows a high-yielding, flat dividend payer.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/company-A.png\" width=\"485\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/company-b.png\" width=\"488\"/></p><p> An investor focused solely on yield will likely prefer company B for its very high yield. While the company may provide an attractive level of current income on an annual basis, the dividends paid out by the company remain static, coinciding with relatively little capital appreciation. An investor in company B may receive bond-like returns but experience equity-like risk. Company A would likely be overlooked by that yield-seeking investor, because its current dividend yield never once surpasses 2%. However, this is not the result of a static dividend payment &ndash; in fact, the company increased its dividend by 36% annually over the 5 year period. Its consistently low yield can be attributed to the similarly strong capital appreciation in the company&rsquo;s stock price, which grew by 27% annually over the same 5 year period. We believe this example accentuates the limitations of focusing on a company&rsquo;s yield as a means of security selection and as an analytical device. A company with a low yet growing dividend may offer an investor greater total return potential due to the strong relationship between dividend growth and price appreciation.</p><h3> <strong>  A Sector Example </strong></h3><p> <br/> Reviewing the results of securities across different sectors may also demonstrate the usefulness of a yield-at-cost perspective. We believe examining the history of these stocks can illustrate how the dual components of total return affect a company&rsquo;s current yield over time in ways that require nuanced analysis.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/select-c.png\" width=\"485\"/></p><p> As shown in Exhibit 2, the Utility Co. stock price appreciated at a significantly faster rate than its dividend growth, resulting in a lower current yield than at initial purchase. But despite the yield decreasing during the period the stock has been held, investors were rewarded with a strong total return experience due to the stock price appreciating simultaneously with the increasing dividend. The Energy Co. also helps demonstrate the interplay between price and dividend growth. The company experienced both strong stock price appreciation and dividend growth over the period, but in this case, the dividend has grown notably faster than the stock price. This led to a higher current dividend yield than when the company was originally purchased, and once again, yieldat-cost helps to quickly and informatively capture these dynamics.</p><h3> <strong>  Santa Barbara's Approach to Applying Yield-at-Cost </strong></h3><p> <br/> We believe a yield-at-cost perspective can help add value for our clients by providing us with tools to retroactively evaluate companies in the portfolio that may be growing dividends while simultaneously appreciating in value. The chart in Exhibit 3 shows a generally widening gap over time between the current portfolio yield and the portfolio yield-at-cost of the Santa Barbara Asset Management Dividend Growth portfolio. We believe this example illustrates a portfolio that has benefitted over time from both dividend growth and capital appreciation. We find the portfolio&rsquo;s yield remained competitive throughout this period, but by avoiding what we would view as overreaching for yield, we were able to maintain exposure to select companies that benefited from stock price gains.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/santa-barbara.png\" width=\"483\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Conclusion </strong></h3><p> <br/> Ultimately, we believe the increase or decrease in a security&rsquo;s current yield shouldn&rsquo;t be of chief importance; rather, we believe emphasis should be placed on the total return that has been produced as a result of owning high-quality companies that possess the financial flexibility to increase dividends while also appreciating in value with time. We view a yield-at-cost perspective as a much more helpful framework for determining portfolio success than simply looking at current yield.

{"original_id":5404,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are Traditional PR Agency Models Flawed and Are You Paying the Price?","link":"are-traditional-pr-agency-models-flawed-and-are-you-paying-the-price","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/basset_pr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Basset PR </a></p><h3> <strong>  Are PR agency business models flowed? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The global PR industry hit $14b in 2015 and is expected to hit $20b by 2020 according to the  <a href=\"http://www.holmesreport.com/research/article/global-pr-industry-hits-$14bn-in-2016-as-growth-slows-to-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Holmes report. </a>  I&rsquo;ve worked in PR for 20-years and we have to say, not a lot has changed and it&rsquo;s disturbing. This is why we set out to create Basset PR. If you haven&rsquo;t already asked yourself the questions below, maybe today is the day to do so.</p><li> Am I paying too much for PR?</li><li> What should I expect from my agency?</li><li> What is the ROI for PR?</li><li> Should I hire someone internally instead of an agency?</li><li> Am I safer going with a larger, well-known agency or smaller boutique? <br/>  </li><p> We cannot answer these questions for you, but based on our experience in working at some of the world&rsquo;s largest agencies, we can provide insights into how &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; agencies are structured, what you should expect from any agency you work with and the differences between internal hires, large agencies and boutique agencies.</p><h3> <strong>  A breakdown of your costs for PR </strong></h3><p> <br/> The average monthly retainer for PR if you are a startup is approximately $10k &ndash; $15k per month and for an established company, you&rsquo;re looking at $15k &ndash; $30k per month. Major corporations may see fees ranging from $100k &ndash; $175k per month. So what does that money buy you? Let&rsquo;s use startups as the example. <br/> For $10k &ndash; $15k per month, you will typically have an account manager who handles your &ldquo;account&rdquo; day-to-day. They plan, field your requests, arrange meetings, deliver reports and make sure the work is being done. The average salary for this person is approximately $80k per year and you are being charged between $150/hr. &ndash; $185/hr. for their services.</p><p> Under your account manager you may find a media relations specialist or two and maybe a coordinator. You will initially see and hear from a Vice President or Director, but in our experience, the frequency of communication from that level in a larger agency dwindles over time because their average hourly rate is $356 and can quickly add up if you are only paying $15k per month. At this level of monthly retainer, you are most likely getting about 56 hours per month from your agency, or 14 hours per week dedicated to your business.</p><p> What are you getting for 14 hours per week? In our experience, larger, more traditional agencies spend a lot of time calculating the time they spend on your account. So let&rsquo;s remove 2 hours per week for that. Another 2 hours for emails and phone calls (YES, you are billed for those). About 5 hours of the remaining 10 are spent researching storylines, creating pitches and matching those with relevant journalists and maybe the remaining 5 hours are spent pitching your story, following up with reporters and reporting back to you. By the way, you are 1 of 4-5 accounts that are being handled by the junior employees. After all, they need to be billable 50-60 hours per week and you are only paying them for 14.</p><h3> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s how it breaks down in simple terms. </strong></h3><p>  </p><li> $15,000 per month retainer</li><li> $265 average hourly rate (blended $356 for VP level and $170 for junior level)</li><li> 56 hours per month</li><li> 14 hours per week &ndash; spent on reporting, phone calls, emails and some pitching of your story <br/>  </li><p> The question to ask is: does 14 hours per week for $180,000 per year deliver what my business needs? If not, there are alternatives to hiring an internal employee which comes with overhead (medical, dental, 401K, computer, office space, etc.).</p><h3> <strong>  What am I getting for those fees? </strong></h3><p> <br/> We are generalizing a bit in this post, but on average, for a traditional PR agency, you can expect some media pitching when you have news, some guidance on what constitutes news, some reporting on who picked up your news and maybe a press release or two. What does that do for your business exactly? Quite frankly, not much. We suggest that you either negotiate strategic, value-added services into the contract, or look to a smaller, boutique agency for strategic counsel, solid storytelling and media relations and integrated communications e.g. blog writing, social media management, customer reference development and more.</p><h3> <strong>  The ROI of PR </strong></h3><p> <br/> While the ultimate goal of PR is to get your target audience to pick up the phone and call you, or sign up for what you have to offer, the truth is, PR is not that straightforward. However there are some metrics that can be put into place to better understand the impact PR is having on your brand, awareness and visibility. Are you gaining more RELEVANT followers on your social media channels? Are you being invited to more deals? Has your subscriber base or consumer customers increased? How many conversations now include your company name?</p><h3> <strong>  Should I hire someone internally instead of an agency? </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is great value in having someone who is solely dedicated to your business and sits inside of your company. They live and breathe the key messages day in and day out. They are embedded in your business. They know the CEO and executives well &ndash; maybe even play a game of ping pong with them each day. But employees come with a price tag that is bigger than just their salary. They need benefits (medical and dental), probably want stock options and some form of a 401k plan. They need a place to sit, a computer and some basic office supplies. If you are a bootstrapped startup or on series A funding, this can feel &ldquo;risky&rdquo; if you aren&rsquo;t sure about the value of PR to begin with. Luckily, there is an alternative and I cannot say this enough &ndash; IT&rsquo;S THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS.</p><h3> <strong>  Get what you need </strong></h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve recently encountered companies coming to us out of the blue &ndash; without prompting. When I ask why they proactively reached out, the answers are always the same. &ldquo;You get it!&rdquo; PR has historically been flawed as outlined above. 14 hours per week for $15k a month? It&rsquo;s highway robbery.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-05 19:42:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-05 19:42:51.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_xKtqynN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-traditional-pr-agency-models-flawed-and-are-you-paying-the-price/\", \"post_id\": \"11529\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-05 19:42:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-05 19:42:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-traditional-pr-agency-models-flawed-and-are-you-paying-the-price\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11523\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5626\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Yield-at-Cost-Seeing-the-Whole-Picture.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"603\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465210800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5405,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A New Approach to Gamma Using Tax-Efficient Investing to Solve the Retirement Income Challenge","link":"a-new-approach-to-gamma-using-tax-efficient-investing-to-solve-the-retirement-income-challenge","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;The retirement income challenge is very real,&rdquo; says David Reyes, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Reyes Financial Architecture. &ldquo;Morningstar came out with a report last year discussing the rate of withdrawal for retirement income. When I started in this business, it used to be 5%, then 4%. But now, Morningstar says it&rsquo;s 2.8%. How many investors have enough saved to live on 2.8%?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Morningstar also introduced a new approach to using Gamma, as a way to measure the added value of making smart financial decisions to increase retirement income. Their new research,Alpha, Beta&hellip; and Now Gamma, shows how a tax-efficient asset location strategy can add 320 bps of additional retirement income&mdash;every year. That&rsquo;s why we use tax deferral to help clients accumulate more&mdash;and generate more retirement income. And that&rsquo;s where Jefferson National provides the competitive advantage.&rdquo;</p><p> To learn more about leveraging tax deferral to generate more Gamma and meet the retirement income challenge, we had a conversation with Reyes about his unique approach to tax efficient investing:</p><p> <strong>  Q: WHAT FACTORS ARE DRIVING THE RETIREMENT INCOME CHALLENGE? </strong></p><p> A: Talk to almost any investor about retirement and they&rsquo;ll tell you their number one fear is outliving their retirement savings. They&rsquo;ll tell you that the retirement income challenge is very real.</p><p> It&rsquo;s real because we&rsquo;re facing huge challenges as a country&mdash; a huge national debt, an eroding safety net, huge obligations that are underfunded on a national level, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and underfunded pensions in major municipalities, like Detroit. Those are big problems. Finally, we are still at historically low interest rates. But when interest rates and inflation start rising, watch out.</p><p> <strong>  Q: GIVEN TODAY&rsquo;S RECORD LOW RATES, WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION FOR USING BONDS IN CLIENTS&rsquo; PORTFOLIOS? </strong></p><p> A: Right now, we&rsquo;re not a big fan of bonds. For the most part, we believe many investors currently are over-allocated to fixed income. There is tremendous interest rate risk, and fixed income may not provide the expected shelter. Any upward push will have an outsized, negative impact. Warren Buffett said it better than I when he stated in one of his annual reports, &ldquo;Bonds promoted as offering risk-free returns are now priced to deliver return-free risk.&rdquo;</p><p> But we will buy bonds tactically for clients. Buy in when prices are rising, and move to cash or cash alternatives when prices decline. To optimize tactical fixed income strategies, we use a tax-deferred wrapper like Jefferson National to mitigate taxes when bonds generate ordinary income&mdash;and to mitigate the taxes on any short term capital gains from tactical moves. In a challenging fixed income market like the one we face today, using asset location to increase Gamma is more important than ever.</p><p> <strong>  Q: SO WHAT ARE YOUR OTHER SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE GAMMA AND HELP YOUR CLIENTS GENERATE MORE RETIREMENT INCOME? </strong></p><p> A: The solution really is to get back to a fundamental investing philosophy that we practice at our firm&mdash;we believe you&rsquo;ve got to protect assets first.</p><p> Number 1, you&rsquo;ve got to mitigate taxes. Pay attention to things like the health care surtax. Use strategies like asset location and tax-loss harvesting. Use tax-deferred and tax-free vehicles to control not only how much you pay in taxes, but when you pay taxes.</p><p> Number 2, maximize Social Security. I do a lot of education around maximizing Social Security and integrating it into retirement income planning. More people need to understand that if you are willing to wait, Social Security actually pays you between 6% to 8% per year to wait. What other asset do you have that guarantees you a 6% to 8% rate of return, plus cost of living? None. So you want to maximize that asset.</p><p> To optimize tactical fixed income strategies, we use a tax-deferred wrapper like Jefferson National to mitigate taxes when bonds generate ordinary income&mdash; and to mitigate the taxes on any short term capital gains from tactical <br/> moves. In a challenging fixed income market like the one we face today, using asset location to increase Gamma is more important than ever.</p><p> Number 3, protect downside risk through active risk management. That&rsquo;s what I call &ldquo;unconstrained investing.&rdquo; We can buy and sell into whatever we want, whenever it makes sense, in order to mitigate risk. We can go to cash if we want to go to cash. We can go to another asset class when opportunities arise, when conditions call for it. And when we do this type of tactical investing, asset location is key.</p><p> So before we even talk about other solutions, just those three strategies alone&mdash;mitigating taxes, maximizing social security, and managing risk with unconstrained investing and asset location&mdash; we&rsquo;re doing those three things proactively to protect assets, to maximize accumulation and ultimately to generate more retirement income. And this approach that we&rsquo;ve been using for years, ties right into the industry&rsquo;s new concept of Gamma.</p><p> <strong>  Q: TALK MORE ABOUT UNCONSTRAINED INVESTING AS A SOLUTION FOR THE RETIREMENT INCOME CHALLENGE. </strong></p><p> A: Most of our clients have &ldquo;already won the game&rdquo; or they are very close. What I mean by that is they have already accumulated enough assets or are getting close to their goal, but need high-level retirement income planning to ensure that they will have enough income to last a lifetime. Just like in sports &ldquo;a good offense is a great defense,&rdquo; that is why we first focus on downside protection. As an example, if you only participated in 30% of the upside of the S&amp;P&mdash; and avoided all of the downside&mdash;you would beat the S&amp;P.</p><p> To manage risk, most advisors only use traditional asset allocation. At Reyes Financial Architecture we enhance this approach by implementing three additional strategies to proactively manage risk: Active unconstrained/tactical management of a portfolio, active hedging of portfolios, and guaranteed income strategies such as fixed annuities.</p><p> Specifically regarding unconstrained tactical investing, you can have more exposure to the markets when your rules dictate, and you can be more defensive using cash as an asset class to help mitigate risk in market downturns. Through the use of these strategies combined with the proper use of asset location we can significantly raise that 2.8% rule of thumb and give our clients more income to last their lifetimes. As a firm we believe these are much safer strategies.</p><p> But tactical investing is an active approach. It can generate a lot of taxes and that can beat the life out of a portfolio. Tactical solutions are not efficient unless we can manage the taxes. That&rsquo;s where asset location and tax deferral becomes essential. And we use a variable annuity as the &ldquo;tax protector&rdquo; for the tactical piece of the portfolio. But only the right kind of annuity.</p><p> <strong>  Q: WHAT IS THE RIGHT KIND OF VARIABLE ANNUITY FOR YOU TO USE AS A &ldquo;TAX PROTECTOR&rdquo;? </strong></p><p> A: We&rsquo;ve seen plenty of research to show that tax-deferral can help tax-inefficient assets improve by 100 bps or more&mdash;without increasing risk. As long as it&rsquo;s a low cost tax-deferred vehicle. And now this new Gamma research shows how the smart use of tax-deferral can help generate 320 bps more retirement income. It adds value at every stage of managing the portfolio&mdash;from accumulation to decumulation.</p><p> That&rsquo;s where Jefferson National provides the competitive advantage. Jefferson National has a tax advantaged solution that is ultra-low cost, with the most funds, and a very functional platform that supports hands-on asset management. It&rsquo;s very easy to talk to a client about a strategy that saves them money and minimizes taxes without the high fees, penalties and surrender charges of a typical variable annuity.</p><p> When you combine all those things&mdash;the choice of funds, the tactical management, plus the tax deferral&mdash;you help clients accumulate more wealth for more years, and you help them generate more Gamma during the withdrawal phase, so you can actually increase their distribution rates to ensure that they can have a fighting chance against the retirement income challenge.</p><p> ABOUT REYES FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE</p><p> Reyes Financial Architecture serves clients with an integrated, collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to financial planning. Their services include investment planning, estate planning, asset protection, retirement distribution planning and a strong emphasis on tax planning.

Decommissioning old world services as you launch new ones, reserving your people for worthwhile jobs that add value to their lives and those of others. <br/>  </li><p> Transformation is not about the illusion of radical change (better, faster services, less crap than they used to be) but rather a fundamental rethink of why you exist &ndash; and a reshaping of the ways you deliver upon it.</p><p> That said, a few events I&rsquo;ve been to over the past week have reminded me that many of us are a long way from this.</p><p> For a lot of people closer to the frontline some minor changes could be truly transformative.</p><p> Over the past days I&rsquo;ve heard the, sometimes sad, reality of people trying to change things whilst their organisation seems to fight against it.</p><li> Of organisations where social media is still banned, or at least actively discouraged</li><li> Of organisations where IT departments tell people resources like Yammer and Slack cost &pound;35,000</li><li> Of people stuck using digital tools that were last updated when Gordon Brown was in Number 10. <br/>  </li><p> (As an aside I was told great stories of young people entering the workplace not knowing what Outlook is. Not even realising that Microsoft made anything other than Xbox!)</p><p> For all the talk of transformation we are in an era of digital haves and have nots. And Matt rightly questioned how seriously this agenda is taken strategically.</p><li> How many social sector organisations have true digital leaders on their boards?</li><li> How many Chief Information Officers (or their equivalent) are part of the executive function? <br/>  </li><p> At the end of the conference I collected up some of the evaluation sheets.</p><p> The first one had scored my slot, 5 out of 10.</p><p> My talk of robots, 3D printing and self management was a world away from what they needed. They just wanted tips on how they could convince their organisation that social media had a business benefit.</p><p> Transformation, like innovation, is all relative. We need to support whatever makes a difference to people.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-05 20:01:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-05 20:01:13.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_V8LdLJc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stepping-behind-the-rhetoric-of-digital-transformation/\", \"post_id\": \"11533\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-05 20:01:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-05 20:01:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stepping-behind-the-rhetoric-of-digital-transformation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11532\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5628\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Stepping-Behind-The-Rhetoric-of-Digital-Transformation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"535\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465232400,"author_id":383,"chart_url":""}

Listen closely now, and you&rsquo;ll hear echoes of the song&rsquo;s core message underscoring some of today&rsquo;s most newsworthy issues: the polarizing  <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2016/05/16-unfamiliar-terrain-with-clinton-trump-match-west\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  presidential race </a> , an unraveling of  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/panama-papers-explainer.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  corporate scandals </a>  and the ongoing fight for gender parity. Similarly, looking at the lyrics through a financial services lens elicits visions of  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/the-dols-fiduciary-rule-the-best-marketing-for-your-financial-advice-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  policy reform </a> , industry  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/why-the-financial-advice-business-needs-to-speak-up-for-itself-now-more-than-ever/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  skeptics </a>  and the generational shift in wealth that have awoken a renewed need for change from Wall Street to Main Street.If you want your RIA to succeed, you need to maintain or grow your client base. To do that, you must welcome the changes being demanded by the public. So how can RIAs see these demands as opportunities to position themselves for long-term success?By now, you know that the fastest-growing RIAs must  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/rias-its-time-to-understand-your-next-big-client-the-millennial/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  understand millennials </a>  &ndash; we&rsquo;ve shared several  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/4-truths-about-millennials-that-might-shock-rias/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  observations of this new target audience </a>  on this blog. You also know how to employ effective  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/how-the-fastest-growing-rias-are-marketing-themselves/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  marketing strategies </a>  that will help promote your brand. But the real key to attracting new clients and building long-term success lies in how your RIA is positioned to take advantage of evolving demographics and trends within the financial planning marketplace. Here are some considerations to get you started.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Look beyond current income.  </strong></h3>Big-league RIAs aside, gone are the days of requiring potential clients to have millions of investable dollars before signing on to your client roster. Today, it&rsquo;s all about potential earnings &ndash; meaning that professionals with high earning potential are equally as valuable to the sustainability of an RIA as their high-net-worth counterparts. Ditch the income requirements and consider how attracting millennial and Gen-X clients today will contribute to your firm&rsquo;s AUM over time.<h3> <strong>  2. Make it a family affair.  </strong></h3>Earning potential aside, younger individuals are set to inherit a massive amount of investible dollars. Over the next 30 years, <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150713/FEATURE/150719999/the-great-wealth-transfer-is-coming-putting-advisers-at-risk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> approximately $30 trillion</a> will change hands from baby boomers to Generation X and millennials. The generational shift in wealth has made younger investors a desirable demographic for not only growing a firm&rsquo;s AUM, but also maintaining it as wealth leaves existing clients&rsquo; hands and is left to this new group of investors. If your RIA is not already looking at ways to capitalize on this future asset base, now is the time to start. Begin the process by building relationships with your current clients&rsquo; children or heirs.<h3> <strong>  3. Recruit new talent.  </strong></h3>The industry is experiencing a talent shortage, and the need to attract new advisers has never been greater. The number of financial advisers over age 70 exceeds the number who are under 30, according to a <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/blogs/idea-exchange/16-for-16-top-ria-trends-2695303-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> recent piece</a> by Financial Planning. A new wave of talent will help your business attract new clientele, producing a snowball effect of opportunity for your RIA to grow AUM as these young professionals pick up steam in their careers and, simultaneously, their investable wealth. Also, don&rsquo;t underestimate the importance of diversity. Women control <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/women-now-control-more-than-half-of-us-personal-wealth-2015-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> more than half</a> of American personal wealth, and <a href=\"http://www.irionline.org/resources/resources-detail-view/women-and-financial-advising-careers-perspectives-and-priorities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 70 percent</a> of women would prefer to work with a female adviser. Not sure where to start? Revisit our post on tips to <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/5-ways-rias-can-attract-and-retain-millennial-female-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> attract and retain millennial female advisers</a>.Adapting to society&rsquo;s evolving demands will help your firm traverse the great generational shift in wealth and carry your business to new heights long after your own retirement. But only the RIAs who know how to position their business to attract new clients will survive these changing times.RIAs, take heed, &ldquo;for he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.

I jot down these words on a rain-drenched Saturday morning in South Florida.</p><p> No desire to run about. No temptation to roam the beach. I settle in. Exhale. Pause.</p><p> It is Memorial Day week-end in the US. An extra day to not work. To reflect perhaps and celebrate what truly matters in our lives. To pause.</p><p> I think of the conversation I have with Gabriel, a CFO I had the pleasure of coaching for a half-year stretch. I cherished my conversations with Gabriel. He is immensely likable, smart, results-oriented, driven. At times, Gabriel&rsquo;s impatience and external pressures get the best of him. In this, our final conversation that ends our formal coaching engagement, I ask Gabriel to tell me what he took away from our coaching conversations.</p><p> To pause, he says.</p><h3> Perfect answer, I think to myself.</h3><p> <br/> If you are a modern-age professional, we expect you to be self-aware and reflect. At its best, this self-awareness is present in every moment. You engage with another person, and you are at the same time aware of the quality of your engagement and the choices you make. I call this ability double-tracking. In the moment, and watchful of the moment, all at once.</p><p> Reflection, however, tends to happen in a pause. The pause is the moment in-between active engagement. Often only milliseconds long. But whoa &ndash; what glorious things happen in a pause.</p><li> <strong>  In the pause I catch myself </strong> <br/> My obsessive thinking, my obliviousness to my surroundings, my inattention to the cues I receive from the other person, my urge to retort with a habitual response. Yes, all of that. That&rsquo;s the catch.</li><li> <strong>  In the pause I clear myself </strong> <br/> Release the mind chatter, the rising emotion, the urge to disagree, the desire to be right. Yes, I let it go, all of that. That&rsquo;s the clearing.</li><li> <strong>  In the pause I consider the &ldquo;other&rdquo; </strong> <br/> Switch my attention from my thoughts to a genuine desire to understand the other. Her request. His demand. Their underlying motivation. Yes, I switch from me-thinking to you-thinking. A transformative consideration.</li><li> <strong>  In the pause I recalibrate </strong> <br/> My response to the other. I choose language that demonstrates understanding. A tone that invites. An energy that fosters connection. Yes, I advance the conversation and don&rsquo;t allow it to get stuck. That&rsquo;s the gift of recalibration.</li><p> All of this can happen in a pause.

In the U.S. alone that &ldquo;switching&rdquo; behavior means poor service costs brands over 1.6 trillion dollars.</p><p> Given those numbers from Accenture and prior research from Bain and Co. showing that it costs 6 to 7 times more to acquire than retain customers, common sense predicts more business leaders would invest to develop cultures of service excellence. But then again, Will Rogers once said, &ldquo;common sense ain&rsquo;t common.&rdquo;</p><p> Rather than lacking common sense, I suspect many leaders need guidance on how to stop the 1.6 trillion dollar US customer churn problem and save money through retention strategies as opposed to advertising and marketing spend.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s hit the highlights of &ldquo;customer-obsessed cultures of service excellence&rdquo;:</p><h3> Select for Service Talent</h3><p> <br/> I often say, you can&rsquo;t put in what God left out. Some people are notsuited to serve others. For example, if you have to tell someone to smile while serving customers or to take their ear buds out and stop listening to their music, you probably hired the wrong person.</p><h3> Develop Service Talent</h3><p> <br/> As is the case with athletic talent, individuals with service talent shine when they receive great coaching. I like to think leaders are not throwing advertising dollars out the window by failing to support acquisition efforts with service development and training investments. Why buy &ldquo;top of mind&rdquo; awareness to drive traffic if that traffic spins right out your door based on bad service.</p><h3> Talk About Customer Service Incessantly</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s been said we are what we eat. I am certain we are what we talk about! If you talk about all that is wrong in the world you are a complainer. If you talk about the importance of customer service and share examples of successes and breakdowns, you are a customer service leader!</p><h3> Reward Service Talent</h3><p> <br/> Put your money where your mouth is! Celebrate those who treat others well. Recognize them and link compensation to service excellence.</p><p> Accenture gives us 1.6 trillion reasons to up our game when it comes to customer experience excellence.

It&rsquo;s so much more fun when you feel like you&rsquo;ve got all the answers, don&rsquo;t you think?  My husband ( <a href=\"http://onstageleadership.com/blog/2014/03/13/immerse-yourself/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the innovation-guy </a> ) and I were talking about the innovation process a few days ago and he was sharing how discomfort is such an integral part of it all.  He said that every project goes through a phase in which you get stuck in the muck of the unknown and feel like you&rsquo;ll never find your way out.   The key is staying with it long enough that when the winds of doubt subside and the muck settles, you can see the new path up ahead.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve decided that human beings are a lot like innovation projects.</p><p> The problem most of face is that in our  <a href=\"http://onstageleadership.com/blog/2014/03/24/the-anti-busy-buddy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  very busy </a>  lives at work, we don&rsquo;t stay with the muck long enough.  We&rsquo;re paid to make decisions all day long and so that&rsquo;s what we do.  We decide.  We decide that this muck is for the birds and we bail.  Of course we have lots of justifications &ndash; meetings we have to attend and very important projects that need our attention &ndash; nobody would dispute that there&rsquo;s simply no time for muck.</p><p> You know,  muck  &ndash; those uncomfortable feelings that show up when we don&rsquo;t know.   When we don&rsquo;t know what to do.  When we don&rsquo;t have the answers.  When we don&rsquo;t know why we feel what we feel.  When we don&rsquo;t see the way out.</p><p> So nothing changes.  We move from one muck to the next wondering why things aren&rsquo;t getting better.  Blaming everyone else around us for the muck we simply don&rsquo;t have time to address.  We don&rsquo;t take time to  <a href=\"http://ktgleadersolutions.com/2014/03/17/shift-your-perspective/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  examine our perspectives </a> .  To clarify our assumptions.

We cannot hope to show up constructively with other people if we&rsquo;ve left a string of unfinished business and unresolved conflicts in our wake.  If we don&rsquo;t deal with the hard stuff, there&rsquo;s no hope for anything new.</p><p> I think in leadership, like in innovation, one of the greatest skills we can hone is our ability to  <a href=\"http://onstageleadership.com/blog/2014/02/26/finding-anchor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  be in the discomfort </a> .

{"original_id":5412,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Top 5 Reasons Why Advisors in the IBD World are Going RIA","link":"the-top-5-reasons-why-advisors-in-the-ibd-world-are-going-ria","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> And the Reasons Why Some Choose to Stay</h3><p> <br/> Ask any Business Development Officer from any custodian or service provider to the RIA space and they will tell you that the vast majority of their new business is coming from those in the Independent Broker-Dealer (IBD) world. I was surprised to hear this too&mdash;until I realized that a large percentage of the advisors we are working with are independent with broker-dealers and looking to us to help them assess whether a move to the hybrid/RIA space makes sense.</p><p> What are the primary reasons why an already successful entrepreneur would look to disrupt momentum and endure the hassle of a move?</p><li> <strong>  The community is wrong. </strong>  The enterprise-building business owner who is interested in adding inorganic growth (by way of recruiting and acquisition) to the mix finds it hard to gain best practices and ideas from those that aren&rsquo;t of the same mindset. In most cases, the average advisor in the IBD space is producing between $200,000 and $700,000 annually and does not have designs on building anything beyond his/her own practice.</li><li> <strong>  Heavy-handed compliance: </strong>  Compliance departments at IBDs are built to manage to the lowest common denominator so that a highly successful advisor (whose compliance record is squeaky clean) is held to the same standard as an advisor whose U4 looks like Swiss cheese. One advisor said it best: &ldquo;In order to do a radio show or conduct a seminar, it took me weeks of fighting to get it approved. I went independent to get away from the bureaucracy of a big firm &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be that way.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Technology can be clunky. </strong>  Legacy systems can mean that an advisor is working with proprietary technology that often lacks optionality. Conversely, in the RIA world technology is not built to serve the masses and so it is cutting edge, customizable, and highly efficient.</li><li> <strong>  Sophisticated sellers will go elsewhere. </strong>  Typically, sellers of fast growing top RIAs will not look to those in the IBD world as serious acquirers&mdash;not because their businesses are necessarily any less wonderful than their counterparts in the RIA world; it&rsquo;s because they do not want to be limited to or by the broker-dealer.</li><li> <strong>  Sophisticated buyers will go elsewhere. </strong>  There is no shortage of acquirers for top fee-based wealth management businesses, but most will look to the RIA world first because there are too many restrictions on a business sitting in the IBD world. In the RIA space, a firm may be multi-custodial, and a buyer and seller need not share the same custodian. <br/>  </li><p> To be sure, almost every quality IBD has launched an RIA sleeve as a way of staving off attrition amongst their top ranks. While this can be a great &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; for the advisor that wants more control and freedom, it is usually only a Band-Aid and will often necessitate another move to the truly independent RIA space as these business owners outgrow the IBD-based RIA model (which is still fundamentally a BD, after all).</p><p> The broker-dealer world can be limiting by its very definition in terms of economics, platform, and compliance. Also limiting is the power to try different initiatives&mdash;which may not be approved by the BD, such as customizing the client-service model and fee structure, marketing and business development, reporting on assets held away, the ability to function as a fiduciary, and true open architecture.</p><p> Make no mistake, most of the folks we work with have at least a small amount of commissionable business and they have no interest in giving up their ability to do it, even as just an accommodation to important clients. The notion of using a &ldquo;friendly broker-dealer&rdquo; as opposed to an overarching one means better economics for the advisor and certainly less bureaucracy to deal with.</p><p> There are plenty of wonderful IBDs who offer great support to their ranks of business owners. However, that support is often perceived as less sophisticated in terms of practice management, business planning and growth, succession planning, operational support, human capital planning, and the like.</p><p> Those that value a turnkey and fully integrated solution, the familiarity of the B-D world, transition money, and the ability to do a good percentage of transactional business, will choose to remain under the IBD umbrella. And, they likely should. The best thing about today&rsquo;s industry landscape is that there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution and as the balance of power has shifted to the advisor, he gets to choose where his business is best served.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-06 15:38:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-06 15:38:27.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_QeI9c3d.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-top-5-reasons-why-advisors-in-the-ibd-world-are-going-ria/\", \"post_id\": \"11545\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-06 15:38:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-06 15:38:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-top-5-reasons-why-advisors-in-the-ibd-world-are-going-ria\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11544\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5634\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Top-5-Reasons-Why-Advisors-in-the-IBD-World-are-Going-RIA.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"827\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465290000,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5413,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Pieces of Advice to Aspiring Women","link":"6-pieces-of-advice-to-aspiring-women","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Jacqueline Moloney is the first woman to serve as Chancellor of  <a href=\"https://www.uml.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  University of Massachusetts Lowell </a> . Dr. Moloney embraced technology early, confronting the boys&rsquo; network head-on. She became a pioneer in online education making UMass Lowell a world-class leader in the field.</p><p> The married mother of two &ndash; who is also a grandmother &ndash; was the first in her family to attend college, earning both undergraduate and doctorate degrees at UMass Lowell. I looked forward to the opportunity to gain wisdom from this groundbreaking woman that&rsquo;s paved the way for so many to follow in her footsteps.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/judith-bowman.png\" width=\"521\"/></p><p> I was warmly greeted by Chancellor Moloney, wearing a classic black dress with tasteful jewelry. &ldquo;Jacquie, please&rdquo; the Chancellor said, in the reception area, which gave me an immediate sense of who she was and set the tone for our time together as she proceeded to share her keys to success and advice for aspiring women.</p><h3> <strong>  Attitude: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I am from a big family of nine, so growing up we were always pushed to work hard, be resilient and helpful, and plan for the future. I have a strong work ethic and I believe in other people, so I think that carries into my work.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Confidence: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Confidence is something I certainly didn&rsquo;t have growing up and has not come naturally. It&rsquo;s something I have developed by earning it, testing my mettle over the years and seeing what I am capable of. Each time you take on a big challenge and are successful, it builds confidence. For me, it has been a life-time of work building it.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Personal and Professional Style: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I have been fortunate to be surrounded by great, talented people. Having faith in other people is at the core of how I work and lead. I believe in fostering peoples&rsquo; inner creativity and intelligence and helping them apply that to grow. The magic is when you reach out to include others&rsquo; thoughts and contributions.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Being a Woman in a Man&rsquo;s World: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think of it as a man&rsquo;s world. I don&rsquo;t feel men have any greater strengths just because they are men. They are not smarter. Men are people. Women are people. I consider myself an equal.</p><p> That said, I recognize that men still probably dominate in terms of power &hellip; I have always inserted myself into those male-dominated industries and have a very deep background in technology and online education.</p><p> Coming up through the ranks in academia, I could have gone the traditional support/psychology/tutoring route for a woman, but I went into technology and saw a lot of barriers. I embraced the challenges, l learned the work, figured things out, and came up through the ranks.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Importance of Mentors: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I have been fortunate to have had many great male mentors in my life help and encourage me &ndash; most notably &ndash; (UMass President) Marty Meehan, who first asked me to serve as his No. 2 person here, which was quite an honor. I do see this as a partnership between men and women in advancing women. If you want things to advance, make sure you have an equal number of women in the room.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  What motivates you? </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;What motivates me is knowing we change lives. We instill a deep sense of commitment to help students build their future and make a difference and I am surrounded by brilliant, creative faculty who help solve real-world problems.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;For example, we have a student group that has developed a model for prosthetic arm for children in developing nations &hellip; another young woman developed a water filter using a milk carton and a little charcoal and is distributing this in Haiti to purify water (their biggest challenge) &ndash; at, no cost&hellip; she&rsquo;s brilliant.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;A set of twins who, as foster children, grew up living in and out of cars. They will be graduating soon, they are employed here, have internships and are doing fantastic co-ops. They have built their confidence to go out and sit next to MIT students, and feel equipped to take on world challenges. So, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get motivated every day when you can come in and make a difference in a student&rsquo;s life like this.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Adversity: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Growing up in a family of nine, we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money. Our wonderful mother had no sympathy for us, and would say, &ldquo;you think that&rsquo;s bad? Well, let me tell you about so and so who has it worse.&rdquo; She made us think about how to overcome it; resilience was instilled in us.</p><p> As a public institution, we are not deep pocketed and get lots of curveballs. Finding the funding to make sure these kids have access and realize their dreams is a challenge. You remain resilient and keep turning every stone.&rdquo;</p><p> Chancellor references the poem ingrained in her entire family growing-up, &ldquo;Somebody said it couldn&rsquo;t be done&hellip; but so said with a chuckle, so be it, until they tried.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Challenges: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;When things seem not to be going right, you find the way around it or wait and be patient, until it&rsquo;s the right time.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Work/Life Balance: </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I have raised two daughters (one lawyer and an educator) and have four grand children (daughters: 36 and 33) When I hear women say, &lsquo;I never feel like I get it right&rsquo; I agree. I think a lot of women really struggle with work/life balance. I think it is still one of the biggest challenges for those who want a career.</p><p> I am very fortunate to have a wonderful husband (another lawyer) of 38 years &ndash; who is and always has been very supportive of my career. We look at marriage as team work, just as I look at everything here as team work and I think, because I come from a very strong family oriented background, I believe in family helping each other. So that&rsquo;s how I have raised my kids and I watch my two girls now supporting each other as they are raise very young children.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone has the right answer. I think many women do a great job working it out and doing the best they can with that feeling that you&rsquo;re never really giving everyone everything they should have.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I have been very fortunate, both of my previous chancellors have been very supportive of me and my commitment to my family,&rdquo; referring to Bill Hogan, (previous chancellor to Marty Meehan) and Marty Meehan was great when I had grandchildren.&rdquo;</p><p> Family sport for the Moloney&rsquo;s is dropping the hockey puck.

These are warm leads, which means a &ldquo;warm call&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  Best Practice: </strong>  Have their LinkedIn Profile and LinkedIn Company Page available during the call.  Look for warm touch points and integrate them into the conversation.

They are good listeners, they understand the challenges in the marketplace, and they are consistent in their database management.</p><p> In short - get rid of the MAD MEN fantasy, the fifties are over. Consultative sales people need to be patient, they need to be hunters, too but they also need to be observers and good at research.</p><p> In this new, sometimes challenging business environment where hardly anything will work they way it used to, even as recent as two years ago we need to be more consultative and we need to change things up a bit. Everybody talks about social media and getting to results faster. I get it. I use social media myself. But what about the basics of human interaction? Courtesy, listening, professionalism? What about picking up the phone instead of tweeting? Sometimes it's important to go back to the way we used to do things, just in a better, improved way. With 24/7 availability and social media connectivity we sometimes forget that we are humans targeting other humans.</p><p> Yes, procurement gets involved a lot sooner and companies are more careful with their spending and only the providers that really add value will get a chance to get their foot in the door. And then you still have to navigate through the sales cycle and close the deal. That is why it's so important to understand who the decision makers are, understanding our prospect's needs and being targeted in our approach. Nobody wants to be sold to.</p><p> Here is a checklist to hire sales people for a consultative sales environment</p><h3> 1. Invite them to an interview and observe how many questions they ask.</h3><p> <br/> Sales people who are \"talkers\" will be talkers during the sales process. It's hard to identify a need when no questions are asked.</p><h3> 2) Schedule a phone interview first and then an in-person as a second meeting.</h3><p> <br/> Most sales transactions happen over the phone and phone manners are crucially important to being successful.</p><h3> 3) Monitor how diligent they are following up.</h3><p> <br/> Keep in mind, the way they present themselves to you will be the way your prospects and clients will experience them. If they don&rsquo;t follow up with you after the interview in a meaningful way, there will be a chance that they are not diligent in following up with prospects.</p><h3> 4) Test their writing skills.</h3><p> <br/> Ask them to put together a short e-mail that they would use when prospecting on behalf of your company. If they focus on generics, not being able to grasp the value that your company brings to your audiences, they will probably end up having a rough time guiding a prospect through the sales cycle.</p><h3> 5) As part of the hiring process, have them do some research.</h3><p> <br/> A huge part of the consultative sales process is doing proper research. Before picking up the phone, sales people need to know who they are calling on, what the industry challenges are, etc.</p><h3> 6) Test their social media skills.</h3><p> <br/> In today&rsquo;s business environment, sales people need to be social media savvy. They need to be able to use LinkedIn and other sources to identify targets.</p><h3> 7) Have them take a personality test and test their sales acumen.</h3><p> <br/> My company offers a Sales IQ (ask me about it! to identify the strengths and opportunities for growth as it relates to consultative selling. There are also tests available that companies can use to determine if there might be a fit. Not everybody has it in them to be a good sales person. And trust me, most people don&rsquo;t have it in them to be a good consultative sales person. Sales people with high affiliation scores usually want to please people. People pleasers want to be liked and they shy away from confrontation. They have a really hard time saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. And saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; at the right time is part of the consultative sales process.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-06 16:19:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-06 16:19:09.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_OaS1hLA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-steps-to-hiring-successful-sales-people/\", \"post_id\": \"11552\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-06 16:19:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-06 16:19:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-steps-to-hiring-successful-sales-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11551\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5637\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-Steps-to-Hiring-Successful-Sales-People.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"641\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465300800,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5416,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Farewell to Real Assets? Not Yet","link":"farewell-to-real-assets-not-yet","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Abdur Nimeri, Ph.D</p><h3> <strong>  REAL ASSETS VOLATILITY: ASSET CLASS VS. THE PORTFOLIO </strong></h3><p> <br/> The global economy continues to exhibit subdued growth and below target inflation. Central bank policies have begun to diverge as financial markets react with ramped-up volatility and gyrating risk asset prices. The behavior of commodities has been especially noteworthy.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/commodity-price.png\" width=\"502\"/></p><p> The wild ride has caused many investors to reconsider their commodity and real asset holdings. However, volatility should not drive the decision to own or not own these investments. Market sell-offs certainly spark investor anxieties but they also raise awareness of the risk management benefits of owning real assets. A careful pairing of these assets can help improve a portfolio&rsquo;s performance and risk profile over a strategic investment horizon. Let&rsquo;s look at how a blend of real asset equities that includes infrastructure, real estate and natural resources can help investors navigate periods of market volatility.</p><h3> <strong>  MONETARY POLICY AND REAL ASSETS: HINDSIGHT IS 20/20 </strong></h3><p> <br/> The U.S. Federal Reserve&rsquo;s decision on December 16, 2015 to raise its policy rate is an important shift that reflects high confidence in the strength and durability of the U.S. economy&rsquo;s expansion. In comparison, most other developed countries&rsquo; economies are growing more slowly and their central banks remain in easing mode, as do the larger emerging market economies of China and India. Select others, such as Russia and Brazil, have been raising policy rates. Notwithstanding these outliers, monetary accommodation continues to be an important consideration for global investors. Because monetary policy plays a pivotal role in the pricing dynamics of real assets, the divergent paths now being pursued by central banks will complicate the growth trends of real-asset-based economies.</p><h3> <strong>  BAD LUCK </strong></h3><p> <br/> No doubt, monetary policy developments will have ripple effects on many real-asset-based economies. Typically, rising U.S. interest rates harm commodity export nations (e.g. emerging markets) via capital outflows, reduced industrial output, currency devaluation and negative trade balances. A trend of rising U.S rates makes projects more expensive, puts added pressure on debt- leveraged investments and raises costs for imported goods and services. Commodity producing nations will face challenges meeting current liabilities because of lower export revenues, reduced capital markets access and diminished collateral values. In such a scenario, it is likely for investors to think about shifting out of emerging market holdings into U.S. dollar assets. However, the distortions to commodity prices resulting from central bankers&rsquo; quantitative easing can alter expected market responses, creating potential headwinds for non-diversified real asset investors.</p><h3> <strong>  QUANTITATIVE EASING DISTORTS SUPPLY/DEMAND DYNAMICS </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the short-term, global aggregate demand lags the sustained production growth for most categories of natural resources and commodities. This demand shortfall is especially felt among commodity exporting nations.</p><p> In particular, the subdued growth in China&rsquo;s property market presents downside pressure for various industrial metal producers. As such, pricing for major metals &ndash; aluminum, copper and iron ore &ndash; is experiencing significant downward revisions. A similar situation exists in the petroleum industry, where West Texas Intermediate oil prices have moved below many producers&rsquo; production cost. Lower petroleum prices pare production, reduce capital expenditures and lower gross margins for high-cost oil producers in the United States, Mexico and Russia. Persistent low oil prices take their toll on more established producers as well. Large OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) producer Saudi Arabia has been forced to reduce fuel credits for its citizens and liquidate financial assets in order to maintain social programs. Among the oil producers, Canada is increasing its energy investment, while many OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD countries are pulling back because of uncertainty about future oil prices.</p><p> Part of the decline in commodities prices during fourth quarter 2015 (and partial rebound in 2016) can be attributed to a strengthening U.S. dollar, while many major commodities are exhibiting overcapacity. This robust supply, stoked by producers ramping up volumes in order to meet escalating debt obligations, produces a distorted view of real assets&rsquo; true growth prospects. While the rate of growth in the space is slowing, many longer trend drivers remain supportive for core real assets (e.g., demand for industrial metals and fuel tied to urbanization).</p><h3> <strong>  THE CABARET IS STILL OPEN FOR BUSINESS: THE OTHER REAL ASSETS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Clearly, many examples in the current commodity space paint a sobering view for natural resource investors. However, long-horizon demand dynamics present a counter and more positive outlook, arguing for a diversified mix of real assets that includes infrastructure and real estate. For investors with a strategic horizon, the long-term case for real assets investing is firmly aligned with the positive demand dynamics in the emerging markets.</p><p> Urbanization in emerging countries is expected to steadily drive construction and infrastruc- ture demands. The population shift to urban centers should lead to strong demand fundamentals for core industrial metals. This is already being observed in the demand dynamics of copper and seaborne iron ore. Copper, the third largest industrial metal behind iron and aluminum, is projected to stay in demand mainly driven by infrastructure investments in emerging markets. New housing construction (single and multi-family) in developing markets is expected to continue, boosting demand for copper. Likewise, growth projections for seaborne iron ore and nickel, both critical to infrastructure development, are anchored in strong emerging market ambitions.</p><p> Projected growth of infrastructure in emerging economies is highlighted in Exhibit 2. In particular, note China&rsquo;s demand is expected to exceed 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the foreseeable future. As emerging economies shift more towards consumer segments and urbanization, the demand for housing, road networks, toll highways/bridges and commercial construction is expected to grow. In summary, broad trends in the emerging markets are   fueling a greater investment interest in an expanded set of real asset classes.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/projected-infastructure.png\" width=\"582\"/></p><h3> <strong>  PORTFOLIO POSITIONING FOR THE LONG HAUL </strong></h3><p> <br/> In light of the recent price weakness and volatility in the commodity space, many investors have elected to divest completely or reduce their exposure to real asset investments, mainly natural resources. However, an alternative course of action chosen by a cadre of strategically focused investors is to embrace a balanced and diversified risk management approach to real asset investing.</p><p> Research demonstrates that an optimally combined real assets allocation may present a better way to manage overall portfolio volatility. A multi-asset portfolio of component real asset prod- ucts is expected to capture the potential benefits of the asset class without taking on unintended risks that can occur when making tactical allocations to individual real asset sub-categories.</p><p> Since real assets benefit from durable inflation adjusted returns, the inflation hedging impact of an optimized multi-asset real asset solution may be beneficial when added to a traditional 60% equity / 40% fixed income blend.</p><p> <strong>  To summarize: </strong></p><p> 1. Maintaining real asset exposure amid challenging market environments may improve inflation-adjusted annualized returns in periods of rising inflation while also providing downside protection via income and equity-like upside returns.</p><p> 2. This may allow investors with strategic horizons to participate in economic growth cycles while experiencing a smoother risk-adjusted return profile.</p><p> 3.

When you advertise or market your company and your products, what is the image that you&rsquo;re trying to create? What is your  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-service-3/create-your-140-character-brand-promise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  brand promise </a> ?</p><p> I Googled the definition of the term brand promise and here is what came up first:</p><p> A brand promise is the statement that you make to customers that identifies what they should expect for all interactions with your people, products, services and company. It is often associated with the company name and/or logo.</p><p> After further searches, I found a few brand promises that we can use as examples.</p><p> Walmart promises &ldquo;Save money. Live Better.&rdquo;</p><p> Geico is the insurance company that promises &ldquo;15 minutes or less can save you 15% or more on car insurance.&rdquo;</p><p> BMW promises &ldquo;The Ultimate Driving Machine&rdquo;</p><p> Some may say these are advertising slogans, but I think they are more. They are promises that the companies want to deliver. So, do these brands deliver on their promises?</p><p> There is little doubt that shopping at Walmart will save you money on the large selection of merchandise they have to offer. This is what they are known for, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone could argue with that. The &ldquo;Live Better&rdquo; part of the promise is open to interpretation, but it would be hard to argue that saving a few dollars wouldn&rsquo;t make life a little better.</p><h3> Geico&rsquo;s promise is very specific. It&rsquo;s a brand promise that can be kept, because it&rsquo;s measurable. You don&rsquo;t hear a lot of people saying that they spent 15 minutes with Geico and only saved 5%.</h3><p> <br/> BMW promises something a little more abstract. Can they really deliver the ultimate driving machine? There&rsquo;s plenty of other car manufactures that feel they provide the best in class. Tesla is combining performance with an electric card. Mercedes promises performance and luxury, as do many other brands. It&rsquo;s subjective.</p><p> And, subjectivity is what brings us to the point that no matter what you promise, you can&rsquo;t control what customers think. It is their  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Nw7Ri9o36_k\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  perception </a>  &ndash; their reality. You can only hope that what you want them to think syncs up with how they perceive you to be. You can&rsquo;t argue with measurable promises, unless they don&rsquo;t measure up. You can argue with abstract and subjective promises like providing the ultimate of anything.</p><p> In the end, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the company believes its perception to be. For example, we can tell everyone we&rsquo;re friendly, but if the customer has a different opinion, what you believe doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s only the customer&rsquo;s perception that counts. So, make a promise that intrigues the customer, makes them want to do business with you, and is a promise that you can keep.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-06 18:03:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-06 18:03:37.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_WSB2UJm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-clients-perception-is-the-only-one-that-counts/\", \"post_id\": \"11558\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-06 18:03:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-06 18:03:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-clients-perception-is-the-only-one-that-counts\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11557\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5639\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Clients-Perception-Is-the-Only-One-That-Counts.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"778\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465297200,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5418,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Employment Laws Your Company Needs to Avoid Breaking","link":"4-employment-laws-your-company-needs-to-avoid-breaking","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Ignorantia juris non excusat.</p><p> In case you&rsquo;re not up on your Latin, that phrase translates to something you may have heard before: ignorance of the law excuses not.</p><p> That notion applies to all aspects of our lives, and it applies to organizations too. Just because your company might not be super familiar with employment laws, for example, doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re out of the woods in the event you&rsquo;re found guilty of breaking one of them.</p><p> That being the case, it&rsquo;s worth your while to brush up on employment laws to make sure your company is abiding by them. Here are four such laws you need to avoid breaking:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Don&rsquo;t classify your workers incorrectly </strong></h3><p> <br/> You may be tempted to classify as many workers as possible as independent contractors. That way, you avoid having to offer them benefits and you don&rsquo;t have to contribute payroll taxes on their behalf. Beyond that, you also don&rsquo;t have to cover worker&rsquo;s compensation or unemployment insurance either.</p><p> But only classify workers as independent contractors if they are in fact independent contractors. How do you know for sure? You don&rsquo;t control their behavior, you don&rsquo;t supply them with equipment, and you don&rsquo;t treat them the same way you treat your employees.</p><p> Businesses that are guilty of misclassifying their employees &mdash; even unintentionally &mdash; are subject to significant fines and maybe even back pay. For example, one company recently had to fork over $400,000 to 96 employees for misclassifying some and denying proper wages to others, according to a release from the  <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/media/press/whdpressVB3.asp?pressdoc=Midwest/20131209.xml\" target=\"_blank\">  Department of Labor </a> .</p><h3> <strong>  2. Don&rsquo;t give your employees time off without taking away PTO </strong></h3><p> <br/> Giving your employees the day off on their birthdays or their work anniversaries may seem like an innocent thing you can do to recognize your employees&rsquo; efforts &mdash; and it is. There&rsquo;s just one catch: believe it or not, it&rsquo;s illegal to give your workers the day off without requiring them to use their PTO.</p><p> It&rsquo;s worth noting that different states have different laws governing PTO. To decrease the chances you may run afoul of the law &mdash; and incur the associated penalties &mdash; check out this comprehensive list compiled by the  <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/LegalIssues/StateandLocalResources/StateandLocalStatutesandRegulations/Documents/VacationPTOLaws.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Society for Human Resource Management </a> .  </p><h3> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t fire someone for taking leave </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s say one of your employees, John, just had his first child with his wife, Sarah. Family members are busy and can&rsquo;t lend Sarah a hand, so John decides to take a leave of absence to help his wife figure out parenthood.</p><p> As an employer, you might be tempted to show John the door &mdash; particularly if his leave takes place during a busier time of the year. But the  <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/\" target=\"_blank\">  Family and Medical Leave Act </a>  actually stipulates that workers at covered companies are able to take up to 12 unpaid weeks off for a number of situations (e.g., birth, sickness, or serious health conditions) &mdash; without fear of losing their jobs.</p><p> You might not like John&rsquo;s decision to take a leave of absence, but there&rsquo;s not much you can do about it. Instead of going shorthanded, you can always hire temporary help if need be.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t withhold overtime pay </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re not aware, there&rsquo;s a new government regulation coming down the pike that could affect your business. The Labor Department recently finalized a deal that extends overtime pay to salaried employees making $47,476 or less. The change doesn&rsquo;t go into effect until December, according to the  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/businesses-assess-effects-of-new-overtime-pay-rule-1463612157\" target=\"_blank\">  Wall Street Journal </a> .</p><p> As the law currently exists, salaried employees don&rsquo;t qualify for overtime unless they earn $23,660 a year or less. So while there&rsquo;s some time to figure out how to respond to the changes, depending on the salaries you offer your employees and how many hours they pull each week, you may have to figure out how to absorb the wage increases.</p><p> At the end of the day, businesses simply need to be aware of the employment laws that apply to them. Do your due diligence, and you won&rsquo;t have to pay fines and incur other penalties.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-06 18:08:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-06 18:08:44.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_jbeMhoe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-employment-laws-your-company-needs-to-avoid-breaking/\", \"post_id\": \"11560\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-06 18:08:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-06 18:08:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-employment-laws-your-company-needs-to-avoid-breaking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11559\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5640\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-Employment-Laws-Your-Company-Needs-to-Avoid-Breaking.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"661\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465322400,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

In 2013, we paid 17.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and in 2014, it grew by 4.9 percent.</p><p> Medicare does not insulate seniors from the burden of medical care expenses. Older adults pay a better portion of their plan premiums and bear higher out-of-pocket costs. The medical care growths continue as people develop chronic illnesses in older age.</p><p> Some improvements may help the escalating costs of healthcare by cultivating a better experience of the care received, lowering the expenses, and evolving the health of the masses. The Aging Council at  Seniorcare.com  identified several trends to help the system to reform.</p><li> <strong>  One shift is from the current fee-for-service to a charge based on value. </strong> The care providers accept repayment for a patients' care outcome rather than for the number of office visits. It focuses on quality vs. quantity. Dan Hogan, Medalogix</li><li> <strong>  Patient management can impact the medical costs. </strong> Many people search for information about their disease and come prepared with questions for doctors and providers (and research what has best success rates.) Patients will demand access to online medical records, communications tools, and transparent data, which have the potential to change healthcare for the better. Shannon Martin, Aging Wisely</li><li> <strong>  The extensive usage of remote medical assessments and monitoring will significantly impact health care. </strong> This model has potential to ward off recurring hospitalization for ill seniors who have little access to doctor appointments. The technology needs to be in place, but seniors, caregivers, providers and payers could benefit. Kathy Birkett, Senior Care Corner</li><li> <strong>  Look at the recent Health Affairs article that speaks to hospital reviews on Yelp, an online consumer review system. </strong> The areas measuring patient and caregiver hospitalization outcomes are more thorough on Yelp as compared to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey used by hospitals. These types of consumer tech-enabled apps will disrupt the system. Anthony Cirillo, The Aging Experience</li><li> <strong>  Wearable devices that measure and monitor consumer safety, heart rate, activity, and falls, are excellent examples of preventive models of care. </strong> Another trend that helps personalize medical care is the diagnostic tests that predict how a patient will respond to treatments. Ben Mandelbaum, Senior Planning</li><li> <strong>  Information and data will have the most significant changes that empower patients and caregivers. </strong> The perceptions gained by active and passive sensors with assist healthcare providers to give better care to consumers. The data will help identify, treat, and to prevent serious chronic illnesses. When people receive education, they are better prepared to control their health and demand the health care system to change and emphasize the quality of life and patient-centered care.

{"original_id":5421,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What It Takes to Cover Costs of Long-Term Care","link":"what-it-takes-to-cover-costs-of-long-term-care","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/longterm-care-insurance-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Long-term care planning </a>  is really hard to talk about. It can be frightening to imagine ourselves with diminished capacity and needing help from others. And since we find it challenging to discuss it, we often don&rsquo;t plan for it.</p><p> Very wealthy people can pay cash for upscale nursing facilities where they&rsquo;ll receive great care. Those with fewer assets tend to get help from family and friends or Medicaid. Everyone in the middle has two options: self-insure or shift some of the risk to an insurance company.</p><p> When a married couple in their 60s receives a  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/long-term-care-insurance/?trk=nw-synd_10_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  long-term care insurance </a>  quote of $5,000 to $8,000 per year, they often decide against the policy and think they can use the extra $8,000 to travel. This sounds fun, but it&rsquo;s not a smart approach. It&rsquo;s important to have a plan for covering long-term care costs.</p><h3> <strong>  Self-insuring </strong></h3><p> <br/> Those who decide against buying insurance are, by definition, self-insuring. If you go this route, you must dedicate a portion of your assets to the possibility of needing care. You can never spend that money on a vacation or other big-ticket items, because you never know when you might need it.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say a married couple retires with $1 million in an  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/the-best-ira-account-providers/?trk=nw-synd_10_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  IRA </a>  and their financial planner tells them they can pull only $40,000 (4%) from the account each year, plus increases for inflation. If they decide not to buy insurance, they should dedicate $150,000 to $300,000 for the possibility of future care, depending on assumptions in regard to return on investment, estimated inflation, the number of years for which they want funding, etc. If the same couple dedicates $250,000 to long-term care, they must reduce their withdrawals from $40,000 per year to only $30,000 (4% of $750,000).</p><h3> <strong>  Buying insurance </strong></h3><p> <br/> The other possible route involves shifting some of the financial burden to an insurance company. In my financial planning practice, I recommend three different ways for my clients to cover their potential long-term care costs:</p><h3> <strong>  TRADITIONAL LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you have a traditional long-term care insurance policy, you&rsquo;ll pay an annual premium based on your age, health and partner status. Most policies&rsquo; benefits kick in if you receive an Alzheimer&rsquo;s or dementia diagnosis or are unable to perform at least two of the basic &ldquo;activities of daily living.&rdquo; These activities include transferring &mdash; for example, being able to move from the bed to the couch &mdash; bathing, dressing, eating and using the toilet.</p><p> If you qualify, your policy will have a waiting period before you can receive benefits. Afterward, it pays either you or your caregiver a daily or monthly benefit specified in the contract until you&rsquo;ve used up the benefit pool, the amount of coverage you&rsquo;ve paid for.</p><p> Traditional long-term care insurance tends to be the cheapest way to get a lot of coverage.</p><h3> <strong>  HYBRID LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE </strong></h3><p> <br/> Insurance companies realize that people are reluctant to shell out tens of thousands of dollars and potentially receive no benefit, so they&rsquo;ve created policies that combine permanent  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/life-insurance?trk=nw-synd_10_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  life insurance </a>  &mdash; which has a cash value component &mdash; with long-term care insurance. When you need money for long-term care, you withdraw it from your cash value. Once that money is depleted, the insurance company starts to pay for your care. You&rsquo;ll receive a lower long-term care benefit for the premium, but your heirs will receive your death benefit if you die without needing care &mdash; so you won&rsquo;t feel like your premiums are going to waste.</p><p> If you find a better use for the cash value of your policy or believe it isn&rsquo;t performing as you expected, you can also cancel and receive most of your premiums back. However, there are usually surrender charges if you cancel within the first 10 years of the policy.</p><h3> <strong>  INDEXED UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE WITH A CRITICAL CARE OR ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER </strong></h3><p> <br/> Some cash value life insurance policies have low-cost or no-cost riders that allow you to access most of the policy&rsquo;s death benefit for long-term care. If you&rsquo;re healthy, these policies can be funded to provide better cash value and more death benefit than hybrid policies. The cash value of indexed universal life insurance grows based on the returns of a particular index like the S&amp;P 500.</p><p> Most policies have a floor of zero to 1% and a cap rate of around 10% to 15%. If your cap rate is 13% and the S&amp;P 500 goes up 30%, you would make 13% that year. But if the S&amp;P 500 loses 40%, the floor prevents you from losing money. You won&rsquo;t receive the dividends you would if invested directly in the market.</p><p> This policy&rsquo;s potential growth could make it your best option if you care more about your cash value and death benefit than about having the largest pool of funds available for long-term care.</p><h3> Comparing three options</h3><p> <br/> I gathered the following quotes to show a healthy 62-year-old woman how these three policies would compare when she&rsquo;s 80 and might need long-term care. For each category, I used a  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/best-life-insurance-companies/?trk=nw-synd_10_0_0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  leading company </a>  that provides the most benefit for the premium paid. Keep in mind that the numbers would be different at every age.</p><p> For the indexed universal life policy, I assumed that the average annual return would be 6%. Remember, the actual return will fluctuate between a floor and a cap. As you can see in the table, there are two values for both the death benefit and cash value: One is the guaranteed value, and the other is a projected value based on the expected average return. It&rsquo;s good to separate the categories to show the range of possibilities. Some people shopping for insurance will want to use the more conservative guaranteed values for planning purposes, while others would like to see how their policy might grow.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/long-term-care.png\" width=\"418\"/></p><p> Each option has different strengths and weaknesses. You tend to get the most long-term care benefit for the least cost with traditional long-term care insurance. Hybrid long-term care insurance has the benefit of very simple underwriting, and policyholders get a good amount of care for the amount they pay, with the bonus of a death benefit. Indexed universal life is likely to provide higher cash values and a better death benefit, but gives you the lowest long-term care benefit.</p><h3> <strong>  Think outside the box </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are a variety of ways to plan for the potential costs of long-term care, and each has its pros and cons. But if you decide not to self-insure, don&rsquo;t be afraid to think outside the traditional long-term care insurance box. Compare different carriers and types of policies to find the one that best meets your needs.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-06 21:25:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-06 21:25:26.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_DSbgAal.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-it-takes-to-cover-costs-of-long-term-care/\", \"post_id\": \"11568\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-06 21:25:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-06 21:25:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-it-takes-to-cover-costs-of-long-term-care\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11566\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5643\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/What-It-Takes-to-Cover-Costs-of-Long-Term-Care.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"957\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465308000,"author_id":123,"chart_url":""}

About 200 feet away stood a black rhino, the rarest and most aggressive of the rhinos. The rhino focused his full attention on us as he repeatedly took a few steps and stopped.

The trick to avoiding a rhino is recognizing and acting on the obvious dangers we ignore.</p><p> There are a lot of grey rhinos in the financial world. Here are a few common ones:</p><li> <strong>  The next stock market crash. </strong> I guarantee you the stock market will crash at some time in the future. The best plan I know is to prepare yourself to do nothing, so you don't panic and sell.</li><li> <strong>  Death. </strong> It is certainly inevitable, yet the majority of Americans don&rsquo;t have a will.</li><li> <strong>  Health costs. </strong> At some point in your life you will need health care, and good health care is, and will always be, expensive.</li><li> <strong>  House and vehicle repairs. </strong> Normal wear and tear should come as no surprise. <br/>  </li><p> Yet another critter lurks around the financial landscape: the bat. Where I live, bats show up every evening at dusk, without fail. Financial bats are equally predictable. These are future events or expenses that we know are coming, such as:</p><li> <strong>  College. </strong> Subtract each minor child&rsquo;s age from 18. That's the number of years you have to save to fund their college education.</li><li> <strong>  Retirement. </strong> Subtract your age from the age at which you want to quit working. This is how many years you have to accumulate enough wealth to replace your salary.</li><li> <strong>  Taxes. </strong> We even know the day and the hour on this one.</li><li> <strong>  Birthday and Christmas gifts. </strong> These come every year, just as reliably as the bats. <br/>  </li><p> What's the best way to cope with this financial zoo? I suggest emulating another animal&mdash;the lowly ant from Aesop's fable. Unlike the happy-go-lucky grasshopper, the ant put away resources so it was prepared for future hardships.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-06 21:56:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-06 21:56:41.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_3xk6yeX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-best-way-for-investors-to-navigate-the-financial-zoo/\", \"post_id\": \"11572\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-06 21:56:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-06 21:56:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-best-way-for-investors-to-navigate-the-financial-zoo\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11571\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5645\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Best-Way-for-Investors-to-Navigate-the-Financial-Zoo.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"697\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465304400,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

He was determined to prevent another terrorist attack from happening again. It put a tremendous burden on investigative resources and agents complained that chasing down bogus leads took precious time away from real cases.</p><p> As the spokesperson for the FBI in Northern California, I was briefed on all substantive cases in the event the media wanted additional information. One of them was a report from a local bank that their security personnel observed a male teenager selling drugs near their front lobby. The exchange was also on surveillance tape.</p><p> The teenager was carrying a large backpack, and when bank security walked by, they picked up a reading on their mobile biohazard sensors. Worried that the teenager might have an explosive device, bank security detained the teenager and contacted both the local police and the FBI.</p><p> It turns out that the teenager actually had been tested that morning for a thyroid condition, and the nuclear residue left over in his system had triggered the biohazard sensor. However, when the parents arrived they were furious at the security personnel and accused the bank of invading their son&rsquo;s privacy. Even though their son had been caught red-handed selling drugs, they threatened to sue the bank and contacted a lawyer to pursue the matter.</p><p> The parents were so clearly in the wrong that even their normally greedy and unscrupulous lawyer told them they had no case.</p><p> This entire incident illustrates exactly what is wrong with this country today: no one is willing to take responsibility for their actions. Instead of being horrified that their son was peddling drugs on the streets of San Francisco, they pointed the finger at bank security and blamed them because their son was caught!</p><p> Daniel Burrus' article where he cites concerns that many  <a href=\"http://seapointcenter.com/daniel-burrus-on-vision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Americans today view their future as bleak </a> . Parents are worried that their children will not have a richer, better life than they did. Contrast that with the attitude in China and India, where young and old are excited about their future.</p><p> The difference? Americans are too busy blaming others for their problems and mistakes instead of stepping up to take responsibility for their own future. We&rsquo;ve begun to believe we are a privileged group of people.</p><p> Our society has raised a generation that feels entitled. Americans need to reclaim the mental toughness that imbued the veins of our predecessors, because while we&rsquo;re sitting around pointing fingers at each other and whining because we don&rsquo;t want to work hard, other nations around the world are stepping into the void.</p><p> My suggestion? We need to get over ourselves and put our shoulder into building our future. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><h3> 1. Behave Your Way to Success</h3><p> <br/> If you want to change your attitude, start with changing your behavior.</p><p> Our  <a href=\"http://developyourmindset.blogspot.com/2010/10/attitudes-follow-behavior.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  actions affect our attitude  </a> because we are motivated to justify our actions. When we are aware that our attitudes and actions do not coincide, we experience tension called cognitive dissonance.</p><p> To relieve this tension, according to the cognitive dissonance theory proposed by Leon  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Festinger\" target=\"_blank\">  Festinger, </a>  we often bring our attitudes into line with our actions.  It is as if we rationalize, &ldquo;If I chose to do it (or say it), I must believe in it.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Chose Your Behavior, Chose the Consequences</h3><p> <br/> As an adult, and as a leader, you need to take responsibility for your actions. The only other option is to go through life blaming others for your lack of competence, innovation, and initiative.</p><p> The greatest stress in life is to hold onto an image of yourself that someone else created for you.</p><p> If you keep trying to live up to their standards, you will never achieve anything of genuine or authentic value. The only person you control is you.</p><h3> 3. Listen to Yourself When You Speak</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://humanresources.about.com/od/success/qt/responsible_s5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  In conversations, do you have a habit of blaming others </a>  for things when things don&rsquo;t go the way you want? Rather than accept blame and responsibility for your actions, do you point the finger at coworkers, your parent&rsquo;s influence, your upbringing, or others?</p><p> Stop and listen to yourself. If you hear blaming patterns in your speech, you can stop them.</p><h3> 4. Man-Up &hellip;. or Lean In</h3><p> <br/> A challenge to man-up assumes the speaker is tougher than the other person. It suggests a lack of manliness and strength. This phrase contains certain sexual overtones because men can use it in a different way than women. After all, it would be hard to imagine a male candidate suggesting that a female opponent needed to be more ladylike to be qualified for the office.</p><p> But women today are not afraid of losing their feminine qualities by being tough and resilient, traits that have been mostly associated with masculinity.</p><p> The challenge to man-up encourages all of us to muster the courage to do what is right. Man-up and Lean-In are the same thing; both mean that you have the grit to do what needs to be done without making excuses for yourself or blaming others for your situation. It means grow up already!</p><p> Leadership is taking responsibility for your own actions, stop making excuses when things don&rsquo;t work out right, and stop blaming others for your mistakes. Instead, develop mental toughness and adopt a Can-Do attitude&mdash;all it takes is a little discipline and hard work.</p><p> When you stop blaming others and take responsibility, life becomes much easier.</p><p> What solutions can you offer to encourage people to take responsibility for their actions?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-06 22:15:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-06 22:15:36.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ZCJ2Crn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-americans-need-to-reclaim-their-mental-toughness/\", \"post_id\": \"11574\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-06 22:15:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-06 22:15:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-americans-need-to-reclaim-their-mental-toughness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11573\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5646\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-Americans-Need-to-Reclaim-Their-Mental-Toughness.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"649\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465358400,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

Holding on to winners for too long.</h3>Known as the Endowment Effect, the investor falls in love with a winner and loses sight of the fact that its best days are gone. There is the fear of selling the position too early and missing out on future growth.<h3> 2. Selling young winners too early.</h3>This is attributed to Risk Aversion, resulting in the investor having fears about the future and not wanting to take the bumps in the road as the stock goes up in value.<h3> 3. Holding on to losers for too long is caused by Loss Aversion.</h3>The investor is fearful of the pain that will be caused by taking a loss and therefore, ends up with a portfolio full of losers.<h3> 4. Not adding to winners when they take off is attributed to Regret Aversion.</h3>This is an investor who, through fear, is hesitant in their decision-making and backs out of building the stock position as it gains momentum.Based on your history of decision-making which of these 4 patterns has cost you the most?

{"original_id":5426,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Looking for the Right Alternative Investments? Be Sure You're Dipping Your Toes in the Right Place!","link":"looking-for-the-right-alternative-investments-be-sure-youre-dipping-your-toes-in-the-right-place","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Even for those of us who see the market as a mostly cyclical, reliable environment, the past decade or so has been quite a wake-up call.</h3><p> <br/> While many portfolios have seen a recovery since 2008, most investors still get the jitters whenever the market dips. The logical response for investors and advisors alike is to seek out new investment vehicles that produce yield and help protect assets&mdash;even in the face of another bear market. But where can you find that yield? The Fed is expected to raise interest rates in 2016, but even if they do, the jump won&rsquo;t be enough to significantly improve yields for most income-oriented investors.</p><p> Seeking yield is a tricky business in today&rsquo;s environment, which is why more advisors than ever are exploring alternative investments. If you&rsquo;ve been exploring alternatives in an effort to find some level of reliable yield for your clients, it&rsquo;s important to understand the complexity of correlation&mdash;especially when considering &ldquo;non-correlated&rdquo; alternatives. The desire for investments that don&rsquo;t fluctuate with traditional financial markets (stocks, bonds, and real estate) is understandable, but the reality isn&rsquo;t always what it seems at first glance.</p><p> The interesting thing about correlation is that it tends to hide when things are good, and becomes really visible (at the very worst time) when things are bad. 2008 was an all-too-painful reminder of how this works. Anyone invested in &ldquo;non-correlated alternatives&rdquo; like REITs, BDCs, and energy stocks at the time were under the illusion that these investments were providing diversification in their portfolios. But when the stock market crashed, all of these vehicles began to exhibit frighteningly high correlations&mdash;and returns suffered, to say the least. The same thing happened as recently as this past December and January when correlations of &ldquo;non-correlated&rdquo; assets spiked. The lesson learned? Correlation can be surprisingly relative, and so-called non-correlated assets only live up to their name if you look at them at the right time.</p><p> This puts advisors in a tough position. A <a href=\"http://wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/are-alternative-funds-going-mainstream\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent survey by WealthManagement.com </a> of 755 advisors revealed that most advisors (43% of those surveyed) use alternatives to provide greater diversification and uncorrelated return. But what if the alternatives being used aren&rsquo;t truly uncorrelated? To achieve their goals, advisors need to find a new alternative&mdash;one that has no market correlation, yet has the potential to generate significant returns.</p><h3> That new alternative is investments in life insurance.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve never considered life insurance as an alternative investment, you&rsquo;re not alone. Just five years ago, they made up a very small niche market, which today is still small. Few advisors even knew they existed, and even fewer knew enough to take advantage of their benefits. But the confluence of unfavorable market conditions and an aging Baby Boomer population is opening the floodgates, and more advisors than ever are using life insurance as a tool to help generate non-correlated returns with low volatility.</p><p> Another plus: it&rsquo;s easy to explain to clients. Most everyone holds at least one life insurance policy. They understand death benefits, and they understand premiums (perhaps all too well since those premiums are increasing every year). With a life insurance settlement, the policyholder sells a life insurance contract to a third-party investor and receives an immediate cash payment from the buyer (one that is typically much greater than the payment received if a policy is surrendered to the life insurance carrier). The buyer continues to pay the premium and then receives the death benefit.</p><p> The benefit to the seller is clear, especially if the policy is no longer wanted or needed. The benefit to the investor is just as clear. Unlike other alternatives, the factor that drives the return on this investment is inevitable. Whether a death benefit is collected depends on one thing: the policyholder&rsquo;s longevity. No other factors are involved. Not the strength of the market. Not energy or commodity prices. Not global economics. It&rsquo;s a truly uncorrelated alternative that&rsquo;s growing in popularity every day. And for good reason. Retiring baby boomers&mdash;all 75 million of them&mdash;are looking for new ways to fund their retirements and pay for the long-term care that comes hand in hand with longer life spans.

Our new customers and those who would like to learn more about us are welcome to visit  <a href=\"http://www.gsbank.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.gsbank.com </a>  to get an in-depth look at our deposit offering.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gs-bank.png\" width=\"630\"/></p><p> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/25/goldman-sachs-launches-gs-bank-an-internet-bank-with-a-1-minimum-deposit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TechCrunch </a>   probably gives the best overview of the bank launch:</p><p> Goldman Sachs has traditionally functioned like a run-of-the-mill investment bank. Minimums to open an account were in the range of $10 million, and returns were not guaranteed.  While that will still remain true for the firm&rsquo;s wealth management arm, Goldman is opening its doors to the masses with the launch of  <a href=\"https://www.gsbank.com/en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GS Bank </a> , an FDIC-insured, Internet-based savings bank.  And just what do we mean by the masses? Well, anyone with an Internet connection and a dollar &mdash; because that is what each account&rsquo;s minimum balance will be.</p><p> GS Bank&rsquo;s interest rates will be high, giving customers an  <a href=\"https://www.gsbank.com/en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  annual yield of 1.05 percent </a> . This rate trumps the average U.S. saving&rsquo;s bank yield of  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/25/goldman-sachs-online-bank/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  .06 percent APY </a> , but is relatively in line with other online rival banks like Ally, which offers 1 percent APY.  Deposit yields from online banks are traditionally much higher than traditional banks, mainly because of the cost savings that come from not having to support brick-and-mortar branches. </p><p> The bank was born out of Goldman&rsquo;s acquisition of GE Capital Bank, the online retail bank previously run by General Electric&rsquo;s capital arm.  The launch of GS Bank and acquisition of GE Capital Bank is a move by Goldman to diversify revenue streams and strengthen liquidity in a market where traditional investment banking isn&rsquo;t doing as well as it has in the past.  Currently, GS Bank has total  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/25/goldman-sachs-online-bank/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  deposits of around $114 billion </a> , which pales in comparison to the total deposits of large consumer banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just Goldmans opening an online retail bank either.  There are lots of the media speculating about the motivation behind such a move:</p><li> <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-26/goldman-bank-website-caps-quiet-shift-before-new-u-s-cash-rule\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why Goldman Sachs Is Launching an Online Bank </a></li><li> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/why-goldman-sachs-suddenly-wants-to-work-for-average-people/2016/05/04/ca003336-10a6-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why Goldman Sachs suddenly wants to work for average people </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.ejinsight.com/20160506-why-goldman-sachs-suddenly-wants-serve-mass-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why Goldman Sachs suddenly wants to serve the mass market </a></li><p> My favourite is from  <a href=\"http://qz.com/670084/theres-one-reason-why-goldman-sachs-is-suddenly-so-interested-in-banking-regular-people/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quartz </a> :</p><p> [Goldman Sachs] recent acquisitions include an Austin, Texas-based startup called  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-bought-honest-dollar-2016-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Honest Dollar </a> , which helps freelancers and small-business owners set up retirement accounts. Its new  <a href=\"http://gsbank.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GS Bank </a> , based on an online banking platform acquired last year from GE Capital, invites anyone to park their money in an FDIC-insured online savings account or certificate of deposit (CD), with no minimum balance requirement and no transaction fees. And now Goldman  <a href=\"http://qz.com/397557/even-goldman-sachs-wants-to-jump-on-the-online-lending-bandwagon/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  is building </a>  an online consumer lending business meant to compete with the likes of Lending Club and Prosper.</p><p> Goldman&rsquo;s ability to dabble in businesses more typical of a corner bank branch than a Wall Street powerhouse dates back to a 2008 change in regulatory classification&mdash;one that gave the firm permission to enter the same businesses as plain-vanilla commercial banks. But this doesn&rsquo;t explain why Goldman is just getting interested in the opportunity now. The reason for that is technology, which has come a long way since Goldman, along with its rival Morgan Stanley, got emergency approval eight years ago to become a bank holding company.</p><p> That change in designation put two of the last big, independent investment banks under the official purview of the Federal Reserve. The move was meant to make the firms eligible for the same backstops available to commercial banks, and to inspire confidence in a market still absorbing the initial shock of a cascading financial crisis. But it also meant that for the first time, these firms could build their own retail bank branches.</p><p> Which raises some questions, such as what does the Goldman Sachs brand mean to the average American and will they recognise that GS Bank is Goldman Sachs?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/occupy-goldman-sacs.png\" width=\"594\"/></p><p> A second question is whether they will purely remain an online bank only, or will we see Main Street America with GS Bank branches spread around the USA?  Certainly  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2011/06/ing-selling-the-rebels-with-a-cause.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ING Direct </a>  did that in the USA, as did <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/05/why-would-a-digital-bank-have-branches-chebanca-case-study.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Che Banca </a>  in Italy  and one Forbes commentator ( <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathansalembaskin/2016/05/31/before-gs-bank-there-was-chebanca/#a3228597e7a0\" target=\"_blank\">  Jonathan Salem Baskin </a>  sees Goldman Sachs as copying Che Banca &rsquo;s story:</p><p> The precedent for Goldman Sachs&rsquo; recent  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/25/goldman-sachs-launches-gs-bank-an-internet-bank-with-a-1-minimum-deposit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  move </a>  into retail banking ( <a href=\"https://www.gsbank.com/en.html?cid=PS_01_22_07_00_01_16_01\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GS Bank </a> ) was set in 2008 by Alberto Nagel, CEO of Italy&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.mediobanca.com/en/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mediobanca </a> , who not only created the digital retail business model for investment banks, but did so in a far more challenging market &hellip; instead of launching the bank only online, it started with reimagining new branches as stores where bankers could educate customers on using technology, as well as interact with them more informally. It purposefully didn&rsquo;t recruit bankers for its staff, but instead drew from high street retailers, and people from fashion, electronics, and other industries known for customer service &hellip; another strategy was to position those retail experiences as more advisory than transactional, to make it easier to migrate customers to its digital channels. </p><p> Will GS Bank follow the same route?

{"original_id":5429,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Centi-Millionaire's Focus on Family","link":"a-centi-millionaires-focus-on-family","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of  Heico (NYSE: HEI and HEI.A), Puts His Family First </p><p> The Miami Herald estimated Laurans  (&ldquo;Larry&rdquo;) Mendelson, 78, to be worth about $200 million. Larry says he doesn&rsquo;t confirm, deny or comment on the exact amount he&rsquo;s financially worth, but money means little to Mendelson without one major component: peace of mind.</p><p> &ldquo;Fame and fortune doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me,&rdquo; he said in his straightforward, humble way in a recent phone conversation I had with him. &ldquo;People have big egos. They want to be recognized. You know, like Marilyn Monroe or a movie star. Look how important I am. Constantly in the news&hellip; And a bunch of them die either drinking, shooting themselves, or taking pills. That doesn&rsquo;t bring happiness. What brings happiness, in my opinion, is peace of mind.&rdquo;</p><p> To Mr. Mendelson, the best thing in the world is feeling good about his decisions. He loves his wife, likes his life, enjoys what he&rsquo;s doing and has a wonderful family. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stealing from anyone. I&rsquo;m not cheating anybody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a decent person. I work hard. I get the feeling of success because I put my heart and soul into it. I did my very, very best.&rdquo; Sure, he&rsquo;s earned a lot of money in his lifetime, which he certainly feels is a great blessing, but he&rsquo;s always put peace of mind at the top of his list of values.</p><h3> A Legacy Worth Emulating</h3><p> <br/> Larry believes the greatest responsibility is &ldquo;to leave your family with good morals, good ideas, good role models, guide them when necessary, to be close to them and to love them.&rdquo;</p><p> There was a pause before Larry began speaking about his father. &ldquo;My father was very intelligent,&rdquo; Larry recounted. When Larry was younger, he went to his father and told him he wanted to be financially successful. &ldquo;His advice was select something you like to do. Do it the best way you know how. Go all in. Do everything you can. Devote your time 24-7 and you will succeed. Don&rsquo;t think of how much money you&rsquo;re going to make and then go figure that. Just do what you love to do. When people do what they love to do, all of a sudden it works out.&rdquo;</p><p> The second thing his father emphasized is the mantra Larry has held close to his heart his whole life: peace of mind. It&rsquo;s not only peace in knowing that you are honest and trustworthy, it&rsquo;s also about focus. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re constantly thinking, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to make more money than he makes&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have a better position&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have the biggest house in the neighborhood because people won&rsquo;t respect me&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have the biggest diamond ring&rsquo;, you will never stop.&rdquo; There is never an end. There is always a bigger home to buy and always someone who is wealthier or more well-known than you. It&rsquo;s a treadmill.</p><p> Larry&rsquo;s family has always taken precedence in his life. From the beginning, he dreamed of involving his children in his business endeavors. When his sons were growing up, they contributed to the family real estate investment business. By the time his sons were in college, Larry switched the focus from real estate to investing in public companies and his sons invested alongside him. Now Larry and his sons run Heico, a multi-billion-dollar aerospace, industrial, defense and electronics company that they acquired in 1990 (back when it was only worth $25 million).</p><p> But business isn&rsquo;t all the family does together. &ldquo;We love each other,&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;We take vacations together. Every Sunday we have family dinner with all the grandkids and my sons and their wives.&rdquo; If a socialite is having an event during Sunday family time, Larry and his wife always decline. Sundays are sacred. &ldquo;Some people go to church on Sunday morning,&rdquo; added Larry. &ldquo;We go to dinner on Sunday night and it draws the family closer together.&rdquo;</p><p> As well as working hard and playing hard, the Mendelson family is a philanthropic leader in the community, giving to universities, the arts and a variety of other programs.</p><p> Laurans A. Mendelson is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of New York Stock Exchange-listed HEICO Corporation, cited as one of the 100 Best Small Companies by Forbes Magazine in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Mr. Mendelson was also named one of the Top 100 Business Leaders by the South Florida Business Journal. He is a member of the Board of Governors of the Aerospace Industries Association in Washington, D.C.; immediate past Chairman of the Board of Trustees, a member of the Executive Committee and the Society of Mount Sinai Founders of Mt. Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach;  and Trustee Emeritus of Columbia University in The City of New York.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 14:21:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 14:21:05.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_OvlS74F.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-centi-millionaires-focus-on-family/\", \"post_id\": \"11586\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 14:21:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 14:21:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-centi-millionaires-focus-on-family\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11585\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5651\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/A-Centi-Millionaires-Focus-on-Family.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1214\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465398000,"author_id":294,"chart_url":""}

Businesses have been trying to figure out just how to advertise and market products and services to millennials. Business owners are looking for ways to hire, retain and be inclusive of promising Gen-Y employees.  </p><p> Business leaders are especially concerned with retaining millennial employees, as this generation has earned itself a reputation for being a generation of job-hoppers. Brandon Rigoni and Amy Adkins discuss this issue in their  Harvard Business Review  article  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/05/what-millennials-want-from-a-new-job\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;What Millennials Want from a New Job.&rdquo; </a>   The authors cite a  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/reports/189830/millennials-work-live.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gallup report </a>  when they say, &ldquo;Those born between 1980 and 1996 are the most likely to look for and change jobs.&rdquo; Taking this one step further, the authors report that six in 10 millennials say they would consider leaving their current job to take a position elsewhere.</p><h3> Why is this? Why can&rsquo;t employers and business leaders keep their millennial employees from leaving?</h3><p> <br/> It comes down to being inclusive of millennials, and engaging millennials in their work. The authors write, &ldquo;71% (of millennials) are either not engaged or actively disengaged at work, making them the least engaged generation in the U.S.&rdquo;</p><p> Furthermore, their analysis showed that &ldquo;47% of actively disengaged millennials strongly agree that they will switch jobs if the job market improves in the next 12 months.&rdquo;</p><p> There are many reasons employees leave that are outside of our control. Creating an inclusive, engaging culture, though, is something leaders and HR professionals do have control over. If millennials are hired on but realize there aren&rsquo;t any growth opportunities, or that their ideas aren&rsquo;t taken as seriously as more experienced associates, they probably won&rsquo;t stick around very long. As inclusive leaders, it&rsquo;s important that we make an effort to include millennials in important conversations. It&rsquo;s also important to interact with them as professional colleagues, instead of seeing them as an embodiment of their generation (e.g., using slang and lingo to seem cool).</p><p> According to Rigoni and Adkins, millennials are looking for (even more than pay and benefits) a place where they can learn and grow within the company. They also want to have challenging and engaging work. If the work they&rsquo;re doing is rewarding &mdash; if they can see how what they&rsquo;re doing is helping the company &mdash; then they&rsquo;ll be engaged and will want to stay. If millennials also know that there are growth opportunities within the company, tuition reimbursement programs and training available to help them build new skills and competencies, they&rsquo;ll be more likely to stay.</p><p> What are you doing to be inclusive of the millennial generation?</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 14:44:10.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 14:44:10.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_QMrW8yx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-cant-employers-and-business-leaders-keep-their-millennial-employees-from-leaving/\", \"post_id\": \"11588\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 14:44:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 14:44:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-cant-employers-and-business-leaders-keep-their-millennial-employees-from-leaving\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11587\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5652\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-Cant-Employers-and-Business-Leaders-Keep-Their-Millennial-Employees-From-Leaving_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"557\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465405200,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5431,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is America Even Engaged In This Presidential Election?","link":"is-america-even-engaged-in-this-presidential-election","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to a new Engagement IQ&trade; study conducted by <a href=\"http://koskiresearch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Koski Research </a> , if the Presidential election were held today, Hillary Clinton would defeat Donald Trump by just 3 percentage points (39% to 36%), a statistical dead heat. A Koski survey of 1,002 Americans from May 31 &ndash; June 1, 2016, also shows that in a matchup between Democrat Bernie Sanders and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Sanders would defeat Trump by 14 percentage points (47% to 33%). Twenty percent or more of Americans in this survey say they will not vote for either candidate in Trump vs. Clinton (21%) or Trump vs. Sanders (16%) scenarios, or that they will not vote at all (4%).</p><p> These findings are part of a proprietary, semi-annual Engagement IQ (EIQ) study by Koski Research that examines brands, celebrities and politicians in order to identify specific positive and negative attributes that drive consumer (and voter) behavior. Koski&rsquo;s EIQ seeks to test new research theories and learn more about four measures of interest and willingness to engage, including:</p><li> <strong>  Likeability </strong> &ndash; do you see the person or brand as positive or negative? Arrogant, secretive, dishonest, thoughtful, hip, or smart?</li><li> <strong>  Lunchability </strong> &ndash; would you have lunch with this specific person or brand?</li><li> <strong>  Postability </strong> &ndash; would you post or share something about them on Facebook?</li><li> <strong>  Readability </strong> &ndash; would you read an article about them? <br/>  </li><p> Engagement IQ results are expressed in terms of positive or negative rankings, with a higher positive score indicating that the public has a greater degree of connection with the subject. Tracking people and brands since 2014, Koski&rsquo;s new EIQ data offers further insight into today&rsquo;s political landscape, including:</p><li> <strong>  Bernie Sanders </strong> is the most likeable candidate, which drives his Engagement IQ score of 25.6 &ndash; the highest among this presidential candidate set. His score is due to performing well on smart and thoughtful, while scoring low on the negative attributes of secretive, dishonest, and arrogant.</li><li> <strong>  Hillary Clinton </strong> earns a negative 2.6 rating because of a low &ldquo;likeability&rdquo; score. Americans in this study see her as dishonest and secretive. Clinton also does not excel in key behaviors of &ldquo;lunchability,&rdquo; &ldquo;postability&rdquo; and &ldquo;readability.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Donald Trump </strong> is viewed most negatively, with a negative 5.2 rating, primarily driven by a very high score on arrogance. Koski Research first tracked &ldquo;The Donald&rdquo; in 2014 when he scored a negative 20.2 on the EIQ scale, marking him as the least-liked person or brand ever in the EIQ.</li><li> <strong>  President Obama </strong> scores very well in the Engagement IQ, with a positive 21.3 ranking, leading across the board for the key behaviors of &ldquo;lunchability,&rdquo; &ldquo;postability&rdquo; and &ldquo;readability.&rdquo; Obama also scores highest on hip, compared to current candidates. <br/>  </li><p> The data illustrate that performing well in emotion- or behavior-based metrics can drive engagement and action &ndash; but that the Holy Grail in terms of making the cash register ring or getting votes &ndash; is for brands or candidates to meet both practical and emotional needs. Achieving this delicate balance is something that politicians appear to have difficulty with, especially when compared to beloved celebrities or favorite brands. For example, the all-time Engagement IQ leader among people in the news is Ellen DeGeneres, with a positive score of 46.1, more than doubling President Obama&rsquo;s EIQ rating.</p><p> This year&rsquo;s race for President is a compelling spectacle, and our framework shows that Americans&rsquo; emotional engagement with political figures is important in their voting behavior. Our Engagement IQ was designed to advance industry dialogue around brand engagement. Our examination of the candidates shows that, as with brands, people base decisions on a combination of emotional and practical needs. What works in the marketplace, works in the voting booth.</p><p> As part of exploring the intersection of behavior and emotion for the EIQ, Koski Research also probed voter feelings associated with key political figures, including joy, excitement, trust, sadness, fear and betrayal. Notable results include:</p><li> <strong>  Almost half of Americans (47%) feel fear when they think about Donald Trump </strong> , while 32% feel fear of Hillary Clinton</li><li> <strong>  Among Democrats, the fear factor for Trump is at 61% </strong> , at 46% with Independents, and at 30% among Republicans</li><li> <strong>  Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama score highest on trust </strong> , at 40% and 38%, respectively, while 22% associate trust with Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump comes in last at 18%</li><li> <strong>  President Obama most often is associated with joy </strong> (22%) with Bernie Sanders essentially the same 21%, while Clinton (13%) and Trump (12%) trail</li><li> <strong>  45% have feelings of betrayal when they think about Hillary Clinton </strong> , followed by President Obama at 34%. Donald Trump comes in at 26%, while only 7% of respondents associate betrayal with Bernie Sanders <br/>  </li><p> Despite Donald Trump&rsquo;s largely unfavorable ratings on fear and trust, nearly a third (31%) of Americans say they would prefer to sit next to him on a long economy class airplane ride, versus the other politicians in the survey. Trump is virtually tied with President Obama, at 30%. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were seen as less desirable seat mates, with only 24% wanting to sit with Bernie, while Hillary came in at only 13% as a flight buddy.</p><p> In a close race like this, a voter&rsquo;s gut feeling can make all the difference. A candidate&rsquo;s ability to engage with voters on an emotional level is likely to make a big difference between getting those voters to the polls to support their candidate, versus just staying at home on Election Day. When it comes to the presumptive candidates for the November election, the question is whether Trump&rsquo;s perceived arrogance and the feeling of fear he engenders are bigger liabilities than Clinton&rsquo;s perceived dishonesty and feeling of betrayal.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 15:39:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 15:39:52.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_xy533gr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-america-even-engaged-in-this-presidential-election/\", \"post_id\": \"11590\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 15:39:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 15:39:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-america-even-engaged-in-this-presidential-election\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11589\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5653\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Is-America-Even-Engaged-In-This-Presidential-Election.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"669\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465406100,"author_id":306,"chart_url":""}

Only 38,000 jobs were created in May while April was revised down to 123,000 (from 160,000). This compares to an monthly average of 224,000 jobs during the first quarter and 229,000 in 2015. May&rsquo;s payroll numbers were the lowest monthly growth since September 2010.</p><p> Couple of things to note here: monthly payroll numbers have a high degree of variability, with a  <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesnaicsrev.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  mean absolute revision of 55,000 </a>  between the first and final estimate. Also, a strike at Verizon cut job growth by about 37,000 but the strike  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/business/verizon-reaches-tentative-deal-with-unions-to-end-strike.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">  ended last week </a>  and these jobs should show up again in the June report.</p><p> Headline unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in May from 5% in April, but even this was because fewer people reported looking for work as opposed to more people finding work. Particularly troubling is the fact that the last two months have almost completely reversed a six-month rise in labor force participation between October 2015 and March 2016. While the participation rate is expected to fall based on long-term demographic trends, the recent upswing against this trend was a huge positive. However, it appears that some of the rise may have been due to  <a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2016/06/why-did-unemployment-rate-fall-sharply.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  survey volatility </a> .</p><p> The one positive out of the report, at least on the face of it, was that wages continue to grow around 2.5% annually and since core inflation has been running around 2%, there has been some real wage growth. Yet for a labor market that is supposedly tightening, this is still quite meager and disappointing. Wage growth has stopped accelerating and has meandered around the 2.5% mark for more than six months now. Bear in mind that wages were growing at a rate of 4% prior to the Great Recession. The May payroll report indicated that the number of unemployed persons in the civilian workforce fell by 484,000 but the number of employed persons working part-time for economic reasons rose by 468,000 in May, suggesting slack still exists in the labor market.</p><p> The remaining headline data released last week was definitely a mixed bag. Let&rsquo;s start with the more positive headlines.</p><h3> <strong>  Unemployment claims remain low </strong></h3><p> <br/> The number of people filing unemployment claims fell to 267,000 in the week ending May 28th, the 65th straight week with claims below the 300,000 level, pointing to labor market strength. Claims are close to their lowest levels since the early 1970s.</p><h3> <strong>  Auto sales continue to provide cheer </strong></h3><p> <br/> Light vehicle sales rose to a 17.4 million annualized rate in May, up 1.5% from the previous month. At the same time, sales for the first five months of 2016 are up  <a href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2016/06/us-light-vehicle-sales-increase-to-174.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  about 2% </a>  from the comparable period last year, suggesting that auto sales may be in the process of leveling out.</p><h3> <strong>  Manufacturing gets a breather </strong></h3><p> <br/> The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 51.3, up from 50.8 in April and the third straight month of expansion for the manufacturing sector. A weaker dollar, thanks to the Fed stepping back from the pedal this year, and a rebound in oil prices have clearly helped.</p><p> That manufacturing is slowly coming out of its beleaguered state was belied in the factory orders data for April. New orders for manufactured goods increased 1.9% in April, on top of a 1.7% rise in March &ndash; the first back-to-back months of increase since June-July 2014.</p><h3> <strong>  Consumption solid but inflation still below Fed target </strong></h3><p> <br/> The personal income and spending report brought good news early last week. On the personal consumption side, spending in April rose 1% month-over-month, on the back of a drop in the personal savings rate from 5.9% to 5.4%. Real personal consumption expenditures (real PCE) rose 0.6% month-over-month in April after being unchanged in March.</p><p> As the next chart illustrates, real PCE is up 3% year-over-year, pointing to the continued resilience of the U.S. consumer and making the best case against a recession in the immediate future.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/personal-consumption_0.png\" width=\"824\"/></p><p> The PCE price index indicated that inflation was firming but still below the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target. Core PCE (stripping out food and energy), the Fed&rsquo;s preferred measure of inflation, rose 1.6% in April, exactly as it was in March.</p><p> The personal spending report bolstered the case amongst the hawks in the Federal Reserve. At least for a few days, until the ugly payroll numbers were released on Friday.</p><h3> <strong>  Home prices continue their steady rise </strong></h3><p> <br/> The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index reported a 5.2% annual gain in March, down from 5.3% in February. The 10-city composite and the 20-city composites&rsquo; year-over-year gains remained unchanged at 4.7% and 5.4%, respectively from the prior month.</p><p> The chart below shows that housing continues to make a slow and steady recovery. The National Index is 3% from its peak.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/home-price-index.png\" width=\"818\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Construction disappoints </strong></h3><p> <br/> Construction spending declined 1.8% month-over-month in April after rising 1.5% in March, a data point that does not bode too well for Q2 GDP growth. Note that construction spending was still higher by 4.5% year-over-year.</p><h3> <strong>  Setback in Services PMI  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The non-manufacturing ISM report for May clocked in at 52.9, down from 55.7 in April and well below expectations. This is the seventy-sixth straight month of expansion in the services sector, but the deceleration in May is definitely qualifies as a setback for the largest part of the U.S. economy.</p><h3> <strong>  Yellen remains cautiously optimistic </strong></h3><p> <br/> Fed Chair Janet Yellen was clearly  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-yellen-idUSKCN0YS142\" target=\"_blank\">  concerned </a>  about May&rsquo;s payroll numbers in a speech on Monday, even as she emphasized that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report. As she mentioned, other indicators of the labor market (like unemployment claims) have continued to remain positive.</p><p> As one would expect, markets were less shy about expressing the impact of a poor payroll report. The probability of a rate hike in June, as determined from Federal Funds futures data,  <a href=\"http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fell to 6% </a>  after the report was released, from 21% the previous day.</p><p> On balance, it appears that the Fed chair is cautiously optimistic about the economy but was coy about the timing of interest rate hikes. She ended her speech  <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160606a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  saying </a> :</p><p> &ldquo;I expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC&rsquo;s goals of maximum employment and price stability.&rdquo;</p><p> In her speech, Janet Yellen also listed four important uncertainties, including</p><li> Whether domestic demand would remain strong amid global bumpiness and weak investment demand</li><li> Financial stress abroad amid economic challenges, including those faced by China and more immediately, the potential for Brexit</li><li> Weak labor productivity in the U.S.</li><li> How quickly inflation moves back to their 2% target <br/>  </li><p> With inflation stubbornly remaining below target amid seemingly stalled wage gains, and labor market data that just surprised to the downside, one would expect the Fed to back away from raising rates at the June meeting. While they do seem rather eager to raise rates this year, it appears that they are cognizant of asymmetric downside risks that could flip the economic situation around rather quickly.</p><p> <strong>  Bottom line: a mixed bag of data continues to pull the Fed away from &lsquo;policy normalization&rsquo;. </strong></p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 17:32:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 17:32:13.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_KmGoIFh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/economy-to-fed-after-a-big-data-week-your-move/\", \"post_id\": \"11594\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 17:32:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 17:32:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"economy-to-fed-after-a-big-data-week-your-move\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11591\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5654\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Economy-to-Fed-After-a-Big-Data-Week-Your-Move.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"817\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465383600,"author_id":158,"chart_url":""}

Selling","link":"why-social-selling-will-soon-just-be-selling","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Back in 1997 when I started my career, there were two things that everyone believed were going to revolutionize commerce and industry.</p><p> First there was the mobile revolution&mdash;upcoming mobile technologies were about to significantly impact how we interacted, shopped, and banked. The second was ecommerce, the prediction that brick and mortar enterprises were about to be displaced with \"click\" and mortars.</p><p> Did this all happen? Yes and no. Mobile phones indeed became the  <a href=\"http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/113379358945/ios-and-android-adoption-explodes-internationally\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fastest-adopted consumer technology of all time </a> . And online shopping is now a convenient and cost-effective route for buying stuff.</p><p> But we didn&rsquo;t change  what  we do, just  how  we do it.</p><p> These revolutions simply added another tool for doing things we were already doing anyway. We are still communicating and shopping (and in 2015, the Fortune-500 still had brick and mortars Walmart in the #1 spot, CVS in #10, and Costco in #18), but we&rsquo;ve changed the  how &mdash;not the  what .</p><p> Social selling is headed down this exact same road.</p><p> From vendors of social selling apps and social networks to industry analysts, experts, and pundits, everyone by now has caught onto the fact that social selling is big. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just read Hubspot&rsquo;s article  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/why-not-being-on-social-media-is-a-huge-mistake-for-salespeople-infographic?__hstc=207358348.24f41be290b46b4c77a01f680b8e23b3.1465309612482.1465309612482.1465309612482.1&amp;__hssc=207358348.3.1465309612483&amp;__hsfp=1493222075\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  \"Why Not Being Active on Social Media Is a Huge Mistake For Salespeople\" </a>  for a few good reasons why you, too, should be selling with social.</p><p> But social selling is not a panacea. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all for your sales woes. It won&rsquo;t magically make your salespeople any better at the bread-and-butter aspects of selling: connecting with buyers, uncovering needs, demonstrating impact, overcoming objections, and presenting compelling solutions to name a few. All of these things are still just called \"selling.\"</p><p> Social selling author and expert Barbara Giamanco makes a great point in her article  <a href=\"http://barbaragiamanco.com/why-im-over-social-selling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  \"Why I'm Over Social Selling,\" </a> stating that  \"Anyone with any real sales background already understands that social channels are nothing more than another set of 'tools' that you can avail yourself of to reach potential buyers.\"</p><p> Social selling is not the \"new\" selling, and it&rsquo;s not going to displace anything, besides perhaps some aspects of prospecting. Great sellers will build relationships well before they meet up with buyers through sharing valuable content, expressing their opinions and expertise online, and standing out in a crowded space. Social selling will allow both sides (buyers and sellers) to gather intelligence about each other and come to the table more informed.</p><p> And in five year&rsquo;s time, we&rsquo;ll just call that a part of \"selling.\" The thought of picking up the phone and dialing a perfect stranger with hardly any preparation in an effort to secure a meeting will be as alien to us as the idea that once we were actually \"dialing\" on a rotary phone.</p><p> True sales success isn&rsquo;t built on how well you are able to connect with decision makers on your favorite social media platform, how much time you spend answering questions on forums, or your follower count on Twitter.</p><p> Sure, those things all contribute, in their own way. But they&rsquo;re not what&rsquo;s going to close the deal. Not by a long shot.</p><p> Social selling has its place in the early phases of the sales cycle in prospecting and building thought leadership.

{"original_id":5434,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Secret to Enjoying Yourself and Progressing Everyday","link":"the-secret-to-enjoying-yourself-and-progressing-everyday","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m currently an executive recruiter&mdash;haven&rsquo;t always been and might not always be. For the last decade or so, however, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done every day.</p><p> In 2004, after spending the previous seventeen years as an Information Technology and Management Consultant, I opened an executive recruitment firm called milewalk. The important thing to note, for purposes of this article, is that prior to the first day of milewalk&rsquo;s existence, I&rsquo;d never recruited a single day in my life. Why, for the love of all that is holy, would I do something like that?</p><p> People feeling a little stuck in their careers certainly don&rsquo;t need to pitch it all, open a business, and take on a bunch of risk to spice up their existence. I would, however, like to offer the techniques I used to illustrate how my experience might help you.</p><p> Before we dive into the big &ldquo;S,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s take a step back. In order to avoid, fix, or eradicate any problem, it&rsquo;s helpful to understand what it is and how it came to be. For starters, &ldquo;career stagnation&rdquo; is not a thing. It&rsquo;s a  <strong>  feeling </strong> , which often resembles boredom or frustration.</p><p> How is it that a &ldquo;lifer technologist&rdquo; could still love being a code-jockey after thirty years, but a rising star who blitzed through the promotional ranks during the last ten years feels stagnant? The answer is simple. The &ldquo;lifer&rdquo; processes his feelings and the enjoyment of what he does differently than the &ldquo;blitzer&rdquo; does. This is usually a result of his outlook or, more likely, that his &ldquo;happiness needs&rdquo; are being met.</p><p> Why do others get bored in their careers? It usually isn&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re continually doing the same things. Monotony typically only leads to boredom if you don&rsquo;t truly love what you&rsquo;re doing. It has much more to do with the way they  <strong>  choose  </strong> and <strong>   view  </strong> their careers (or jobs).</p><p> Most people  choose  their careers (or even jobs) backwards. When they approach career evaluation or job changing, they consider available opportunities in the market and then determine whether it matches what they  <strong>  can </strong>   <strong>  and </strong>   <strong>  want </strong>  to do. During that assessment, they&rsquo;re determining whether the intersection between &ldquo;available&rdquo; and &ldquo;can/want&rdquo; will provide enough compensation so they can manage to live the remaining 128 hours of the week. That is, many people work in order to live the rest of their lives, so they look at work first and the rest of their lives second.</p><p> The this-is-what-I&rsquo;m-good-at or this-is-what-I&rsquo;m-qualified-to-do syndrome perpetuates an ongoing chain of doing the same type of job year after year. Many are afraid they won&rsquo;t be able to support themselves by making a switch&mdash;even if the switch is minor. Sometimes, they hop companies thinking the change of scenery will cure their boredom.</p><p> This ongoing chain remains firmly in tact regardless of the how many new shades of wallpaper they stare at because people generally view their lives in two separate and distinct components&mdash;work and personal. (Do I hear a &ldquo;work-life-balance&rdquo; echo?) Most people actually live their lives this way. I&rsquo;m okay with that, as long as they don&rsquo;t  <strong>  view </strong>  their lives this way.</p><p> How can you put yourself in a position to enjoy yourself and progress everyday?</p><p> <strong>  Realize your life actually means your   entire   life </strong> .  <strong>  Your career is only one portion </strong> . Your  life  means  all  of your life. There is no such thing as &ldquo;work life&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal life.&rdquo; There is definitely no such thing as work-life-balance. (There are work and life choices.) People love to compartmentalize things, but technically it&rsquo;s all your life. It&rsquo;s not this or that. It&rsquo;s this  and  that. You need to get it all working in harmony to make you a happy you.</p><p> <strong>  Identify what makes you happy. </strong>  The most effective way to become happy is to recognize that happiness comes from within and change your thoughts. The next best way is to build your life to ensure your needs are being met. Your career might satisfy many needs, but it won&rsquo;t satisfy all of them.</p><p> I work with some job candidates that think their job, company, or next company needs to satisfy all their needs. I challenge them to make a very complete list of happiness requirements (need to haves, nice to haves, and really nice to haves) and then make sure they can meet those needs in their life. If the job satisfies most, that&rsquo;s fantastic. If the job doesn&rsquo;t satisfy some, make sure to satiate these needs during the remaining 128 hours in the week. For example, you might want to work for a company that is philanthropic because charitable contributions are important to you. As long as you have a job that allows the flexibility to do these types of benevolent acts during or outside of work hours, you&rsquo;re covered.</p><p> <strong>  Be open </strong> . There are many ways to earn a living. Your visibility to what those are is probably quite limited. Most people only know what they&rsquo;re familiar with. When considering alternate options, be more open-minded, do more research, and seek insight from others who know more!</p><p> <strong>  Choose your career. Don&rsquo;t let your career choose you </strong> . If you&rsquo;re now viewing your life in its entirety and there is no &ldquo;work first and the rest of my life second,&rdquo; you can determine which career or job satisfies you in terms of becoming whole. Use your happiness criteria to drive your thinking regarding options within your profession or outside of it.  The most important element of remaining fresh and progressing is to be happy and interested in what you&rsquo;re doing.  If you&rsquo;re happy, you&rsquo;ll perform your job better. If you perform your job better, more opportunities will naturally arise. The position and/or company that satisfies the most or all of your needs is going to put you in a position to remain happy, learn the most, and likely increase your chances of success.</p><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;d like to &ldquo;show my work&rdquo; so to speak </strong> . When I was an IT executive, as I mentioned earlier, I was feeling mentally stuck after almost two decades in that profession. Keep in mind, I had held several positions that ranged from developing software, managing projects, selling projects, managing accounts, running business units and a host of other activities. I share that to help you understand that no one is exempt from feeling stuck, even when you&rsquo;ve had variety throughout your career.</p><p> I took a few hours and thought about everything I wanted  in my life &mdash;not just in my work. I dug up the list of 22 requirements I created in 2004&mdash;with no edits (please forgive me). These were the, uh, thoughts that told me I should become a recruiter. Before I created this list, I had never (and I mean absolutely never) considered becoming a recruiter to be a professional option for me.</p><li> Need to help  <strong>  people </strong> &mdash;it&rsquo;s what I love doing  <strong>  the </strong>   <strong>  most. </strong>  The more I can help, the better I&rsquo;ll feel.</li><li> Need to help  <strong>  companies </strong> &mdash;I love consulting.</li><li> Need to  <strong>  market </strong> ,  <strong>  sell </strong> , and  <strong>  deliver </strong>  some type of service or product.</li><li> Need a high degree of  <strong>  psychology </strong>  to be successful.</li><li> Need  <strong>  variety </strong> .</li><li> Need  <strong>  freedom </strong> .</li><li> Need  <strong>  flexibility </strong>  to say &ldquo; <strong>  no </strong> &rdquo; to whomever I want.</li><li> Need to be able to  <strong>  take any day off </strong>  any time of year.</li><li> Need to  <strong>  write </strong> .</li><li> Need to  <strong>  build </strong>  something&mdash;preferably my own company, but would also be happy building a unit inside the company.</li><li> Want a  <strong>  low barrier to entry </strong>  with a  <strong>  high barrier to success </strong> ; that means I can get into the business quickly even though survival will be difficult; competition should be irrelevant.</li><li> Need to  <strong>  speak </strong> ; need a high degree of communication.</li><li> Requires  <strong>  thinking </strong>  versus rote acts.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t want a boss </strong> ; my customers can be my bosses, but I maintain the right to say NO.</li><li> Need to be able to  <strong>  grow with my career </strong> .</li><li> Want to  <strong>  never lose touch </strong>  with reality and always be in tune with what&rsquo;s happening in the market.</li><li> Find a way to  <strong>  leverage statistics </strong>  to make critical business decisions.</li><li> <strong>  Get rid of the commute </strong>  or at least be able to choose the office location.</li><li> I want  <strong>  work and play </strong>  to look like the same thing.</li><li> Create more  <strong>  time for family </strong>  and friends and other recreational activities such as exercising and so forth.</li><li> Be able to  <strong>  do business from anywhere </strong>  with anyone (house, office, restaurant, coffee shop, golf course, etc.).</li><li> Needs to be a profession where I can offer  <strong>  charitable services. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Did you notice the common thread?

Keeping a &ldquo;Done&rdquo; list can be a powerful tool to spur you to further action.  </p><p> <strong>  Create a Done list by keeping a daily record of all the tasks you began and completed that day, so you can reflect on your work output </strong> . You can finish the day clear about the progress you&rsquo;ve made and more focused on where to begin the next day&rsquo;s activities.  </p><p> Our business often requires smaller, less notable activities. Of course, you&rsquo;d love to be in front of great prospects, closing business deals each day, but some days will be filled with more menial tasks, such as wiring funds for a client, training your assistant in a new process for opening accounts, or in-putting trade notes. The day can get so busy with these seemingly less important tasks, you can sometimes get to the end of it feeling like you haven&rsquo;t achieved anything, leaving you frustrated and discouraged.</p><p> However, these types of tasks are also important to running your business, even though they might not make you feel excited and energized. We all have the same finite amount of time each day, and accomplishing even &ldquo;small&rdquo; tasks or moving projects forward is valuable.  <strong>  Making note of what you have done will keep you encouraged and more eager to move to the next task. </strong></p><p> Clients I have worked with who have developed the habit of keeping a Done list find they start eagerly anticipating tasks that previously seemed daunting. Where they previously would procrastinate, they find  <strong>  their focus shifts from all the work that needs to be done (which can feel overwhelming) to looking forward to the satisfaction they will experience when they can tick a project off their list and reflect on their significant achievement. </strong>  They sometimes even start playing motivating, competitive games, seeing if they can achieve more items today than they did yesterday.</p><p> By recording the activities you&rsquo;ve completed, you&rsquo;ll see how productive you&rsquo;ve been and won&rsquo;t finish the day drained and wondering where all your time went or what you have to show for it. You&rsquo;ll probably find you&rsquo;re completing more than you thought you were. You&rsquo;ll see how long various activities realistically take, which will allow for effective planning as you move forward. If you are actually wasting a lot of time on distractions, you&rsquo;ll see that, too, and be able to adjust to do more meaningful activities. </p><h3> <strong>  Try your own Done list.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  For one week keep a list of activities you complete each day, no matter how small they may seem. The items on your previous day&rsquo;s list will give you a target to aim for the next day. Have fun seeing if you can achieve more tomorrow than you did today </strong> . The most effective way to do this is to:</p><li> <strong>  Keep a notepad easily accessible </strong> . Make it quick and simple to record your activities.</li><li> <strong>  Record all of your completed activities </strong> . Even if it&rsquo;s small, jot it down. Mentally congratulate yourself, and then move to your next activity.</li><li> <strong>  Review the list at the end of the day.  </strong> See how much you&rsquo;ve accomplished, feel great about your efforts, and take another look at it the next morning to spur you on to a new day&rsquo;s activities.</li><p> Wishing you a wildly productive day!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 18:14:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 18:14:59.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_222bsKy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-is-more-powerful-than-your-to-do-list/\", \"post_id\": \"11600\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 18:14:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 18:14:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-is-more-powerful-than-your-to-do-list\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11599\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5657\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/This-Is-More-Powerful-Than-Your-To-Do-List.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"530\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465394400,"author_id":378,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5436,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Over-Engineering the Client Experience - 'Digital' Is Not the Answer to Everything!","link":"over-engineering-the-client-experience-digital-is-not-the-answer-to-everything","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Unless you have been living in a cave for the last twenty years, it will not have escaped your notice that the world has been undergoing a technological revolution. Much has changed over the decades, but perhaps nothing more so than the ability of human beings to do almost everything quicker and more effeciently as a result of the digital world.</p><p> Despite growing up without one, I cannot remember what the world used to be like before the mobile phone. I even went on a BBC TV programme in 2012, Turn Back Time, to live as my ancestors did in the early 1900s, to rekindle the experience. Whilst existing without digital was very different, our lives were enriched in so many other ways.</p><p> There is no doubting that technological advancement has transformed our lives positively on so many fronts, however. From a customer experience perspective, technology has been responsible for almost completely shifting the power of commerce from the supplier to the customer. Shopkeepers in the early 1900s would never have believed it possible for someone to order a product from a little mobile device and have it delivered to a destination anywhere in the world within just a few hours. If we sit back and reflect on these things, it is quite remarkable.</p><h3> Customer journey</h3><p> <br/> Despite so much progress being made by so many, it is actually quite amazing to see large, multi-national organisations still grappling with the digital world. I work with a number of very large businesses who have &lsquo;digital&rsquo; as one of their key strategic priorities. It is almost as though the internet has only just been discovered. These businesses have been merrily observing the world changing all around them, without stopping to consider what these changes might mean for them and their customers.</p><p> As a result of a lack of ability to move with the times, many of these businesses are now fighting to try and catch up &ndash; hence having a digital strategic priority. However, in their haste to catch up, they are at risk of making a fundamental mistake &ndash; trying to &lsquo;digitise&rsquo; everything.</p><p> For example - last year I attended a thought leadership dinner with a technology company. The senior technology leaders around the table represented many large, well-known retailers. They were keen to understand how to build &lsquo;better business cases&rsquo; to get more investment in mobile devices. When I asked them how these mobile devices would improve their respective customer journeys, few were able to respond. It felt to me as though they were under the impression everything &lsquo;just needs digital&rsquo; &ndash; but I feel that is  over-engineering the problem,</p><h3> Closing the curtains</h3><p> <br/> Too many organisations are investing heavily in digital technology without understanding the most fundamental requirement of customer experience &ndash; the customer journey. Everyone involved in investing in digital should be acutely aware of how digital technology will better enable business process to improve the customer journey. If that is not known, I would not invest in the technology at all.</p><p> One of my first blog posts in 2012 brought the challenges of &lsquo;digital&rsquo; to life. I had the pleasure of staying in a CitizenM hotel in Glasgow. CitizenM is a very innovative and entrepreneurial hotel chain &ndash; their hotels are very &lsquo;cool&rsquo; and hyper-digital. My issue came with the bedroom &ndash; entirely controlled by a handheld device. All I wanted to do was close the curtains, but rather than the few milliseconds usually required for such an act, CitizenM's digital Moonpad required me to hold a button down for the duration I required for them to be opened and closed. It was a process that took over 15 seconds each time. A completely pointless bit of innovation.</p><p> A few weeks ago, I was in Berlin with a client. I could not join them as they went to a restaurant on the first night. When they arrived at the office on the second day, I asked them how their &lsquo;experience&rsquo; was. &lsquo;Ok&rsquo; was the reply. When they explained why it was just &lsquo;ok&rsquo; it brought to life yet another example of trying to over-engineer the customer experience.</p><p> They visited a restaurant that had a menu entirely operated by tablet. The menu was displayed on it and all food ordered through it. Sounds quote cool. In theory, it should make the customer experience quicker and the restaurant processes simpler and smoother. That is in theory. In reality, the tablet was not designed very well &ndash; with a group of 10 people ordering, certain items were selected more than once and the &lsquo;app&rsquo; could not cope with the demand. The result was that the tablet took the order incorrectly and the wrong food was delivered. The restaurant blamed the customer for using the tablet incorrectly &ndash; they rather missed the point and upset the customers in the process. </p><p> In a world where technological advancement is likely to continue unabated, we must never forget that all experiences require people to participate in them. Digital is not the answer to everything &ndash; although aspects of it can undeniably make our lives considerably easier. Amazon are perhaps the world biggest and best example of simplifying the customer journey through innovative (yet simple) technology &ndash; yet it is people that underpin their very ability to do what they do. We must use technology where it can have a demonstrable effect on improving both the customer and employee experience . If  it will not improve the experience then maybe, just maybe, we have to consider the fact that digital is not the solution for everything. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 18:48:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 18:48:03.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_kpJAa3V.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/over-engineering-the-client-experience-digital-is-not-the-answer-to-everything/\", \"post_id\": \"11602\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 18:48:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 18:48:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"over-engineering-the-client-experience-digital-is-not-the-answer-to-everything\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11601\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5658\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Over-Engineering-the-Client-Experience-Digital-Is-Not-the-Answer-to-Everything.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"654\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465401600,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5437,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Does the Government Manipulate Data to Make It Look Good for Them?","link":"does-the-government-manipulate-data-to-make-it-look-good-for-them","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A few weeks ago I received this email from Suzanne:  Hi George. I read your blogs every week. Don&rsquo;t you think the government manipulates the data to make it look good for them? <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s an interesting question, and one I think about a lot. That said, I don&rsquo;t believe the government is the culprit. While I don&rsquo;t doubt they might choose to manipulate the data if they could, the good thing about data is that it&rsquo;s objective, not subjective. But how that data is reported matters, and in the past few decades we&rsquo;ve seen a major shift in both <u>  what </u>  the media reports and  <u>  how </u>  they report it. Here&rsquo;s an example: <br/> <br/> In April, the US economy added 160,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate held steady at 5%. What&rsquo;s the bumper-sticker headline? &ldquo;US employment slows as only 160,000 jobs added in April.&rdquo; But when you dig into the facts (which I consider to be part of my job), the slowdown isn&rsquo;t much of news item. Why? Because the economy is finally approaching &ldquo;full employment.&rdquo; This means that nearly everyone who is willing to work and looking for a job has one. The unemployment rate is near an 8-year low, so it&rsquo;s not expected to dip much further from its current level. And since the pool of unemployed workers is shrinking, job gains are also  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-payroll-gains-set-to-slow-2016-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  expected to slow down </a> . But, of course, none of these important facts make a slick headline. <br/> <br/> <strong>  And sometimes the media simply distorts the meaning of the facts. </strong> <br/> <br/> A headline in  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/\" target=\"_blank\">  TheWall Street Journal </a>  last week read  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/balance-due-credit-card-debt-nears-1-trillion-as-banks-push-plastic-1463736600\" target=\"_blank\">  Balance Due: Credit-Card Debt Nears $1 Trillion as Banks Push Plastic </a> . What an interesting take on some basic data. The following chart illustrates the increase in household liabilities that is covered in the article, but from my perspective the data tells a different story: one of healthy growth in consumer spending and a reasonable expansion of consumer debt as we emerge from the depths of the Great Recession.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/household-liabilities.png\" width=\"517\"/></p><p> Despite the Journal&rsquo;s headline, debt in and of itself isn&rsquo;t a bad thing. Even more, the increase in debt is more likely the result of historically low interest rates and increased consumer confidence than of banks &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; anything. In the face of the increase, the important question to ask is whether consumers have the ability to pay off new debt. The answer: they can and they are. Wages are up overall. Not  average  or  median  wages (which is what the media talks about) but total income, which supports this higher level of spending. That&rsquo;s why consumer debt increasing is not a real problem&mdash;despite the implication by the media. <br/> <br/> Then there&rsquo;s this headline:  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=16&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMt-mt74XNAhUK_mMKHU4TCVs4ChAWCD0wBQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbackintheusa.us%2Farticles2.php%3Ftitle2%3DRetailStoresContinuetoFail&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7_Kxqo1NLvSfTQ70FzkK1dI5keg&amp;b\" target=\"_blank\">  America&rsquo;s Retail Stores Continue to Fail </a> . But this next chart shows the real story: an increase in Internet sales and a decrease in department store sales.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/retail-sales.png\" width=\"522\"/></p><p> The truth is that every dollar we spend online has legs, distributing its way into the economy just as much as department store sales did back in the &ldquo;old days.&rdquo; Where we shop is changing. My parents bought most of what we needed at  <a href=\"http://www.sears.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwj7q6BRDcxfG4pNTQ2NoBEiQAzUpuW_bSvP6xx8izbWP5tMgvUDgE9AG8tvvG53L7BKmROMsaAoXd8P8HAQ&amp;sid=ISx20140327xBrand&amp;psid=g_e9ac230b4f80ad88495f5903d3eb717f&amp;knshCrid=24731&amp;k_clickID=_kenshoo_clickid_&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4531!\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sears </a>  and the A&amp;P store. Today, the go-to standard is  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Amazon.com </a> . Patterns change, and with that change there are winners and losers. Yes, it may be tough for our minds to adjust to the shift, but the bottom line is that the media often doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. <br/> <br/> If I had it my way, the headlines would always be rewritten to tell the truth instead of grab reader attention. Instead of using &ldquo;Balance Due: Credit-Card Debt nears $1 Trillion as Banks Push Plastic&rdquo; to not-so-subtly accuse those greedy bankers of twisting the consumers&rsquo; arms, I&rsquo;d edit the headline to &ldquo;Consumer spending is back to healthy pre-recession levels.&rdquo; Their headline draws the emotion, but mine is just as accurate.Instead of writing that &ldquo;The sum, close to the all-time peak of $1.02 Trillion&hellip;could signal an easing of frugal habits ingrained by the recession,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d rewrite it to say, &ldquo;The sum tells us something great: consumers are finally comfortable spending again after the deepest recession of our times.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Media bias is nothing new (remember my blog Headlines sell, but don&rsquo;t let them mislead you! from way back in 2014?), but it seems to get worse every day. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to look closely at the data, consider the source, and come to your own conclusions. You may even try rewriting a headline or two to help uncover the real news rather than just reading the &ldquo;story.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 21:59:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 21:59:47.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_7x1mfhS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/does-the-government-manipulate-data-to-make-it-look-good-for-them/\", \"post_id\": \"11606\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 21:59:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 21:59:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"does-the-government-manipulate-data-to-make-it-look-good-for-them\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11603\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5659\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Does-the-Government-Manipulate-Data-to-Make-It-Look-Good-for-Them.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"635\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465416000,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5438,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Stay the Course (Even When Doing So Holds Doubt, Difficulty and Discomfort)","link":"how-to-stay-the-course-even-when-doing-so-holds-doubt-difficulty-and-discomfort","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently, after a lot of deep thought, listening to my intuition and returning to my purpose, I made a difficult yet important decision regarding the strategy of my business.</p><p> After I became conscious, convinced and convicted about setting sail on a different path, I thought it was &ldquo;job done.&rdquo;</p><p> Bahahahaha!</p><p> (As a coach, the irony of not linking intention with implementation is not lost on me!)</p><p> Within a mere two weeks of putting a stake in the ground and recalibrating my compass for my new perceived Utopia, I have already come up against the first and real roadblock to &lsquo;staying the course.&rsquo;</p><p> Without boring you with the details, my first struggle with executing my strategy involved a tussle with my ego. A facing-off between the reality of examining what I am good at versus what I love to do. And, realising the two can be mutually exclusive.</p><p> It also required a gut wrenching wrangle around sacrificing short-term financial gain for long term achievement and financial success.</p><p> Not to mention the whole deep and meaningful lark around being true to purpose, self and actually doing what I feel I&rsquo;m put on this earth to do (and be).</p><p> No wonder I&rsquo;m feeling exhausted!</p><p> So my question is this:</p><p> <b>  How do we stay the course, when we encounter that first stretch of choppy waters, that initial rough weather; those challenges that accompany setting sail towards achieving our personal or organisational purpose? </b></p><p> Never mind the EXTERNAL roadblocks and detours. I want to know how we get in our OWN way?!</p><p> I don&rsquo;t know the answer and I&rsquo;m still in that conflicted, squirmy, uncomfortable space of navigating my way through this.</p><p> <strong>  But, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m learning &ndash; vicariously, through research and my own bumbling, meandering discovery: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Identify upfront (ideally simultaneously, whilst you develop your strategy) likely roadblocks, challenges, risks and triggers for achieving &lsquo;said&rsquo; ideal scenario. </strong>  Ensure you focus not only on external constraints, but also on such nebulous yet powerful concepts such as current culture and capability, deeply held paradigms and less than helpful habits or modes of operating.</li><li> <strong>  Notice and name how the current course serves you. </strong>  For me, this meant recognising that continuing with my existing strategy was a safer, financially more successful (in the short term anyway) path. It meant acknowledging my ego and how it got stroked by my current strategy. It meant naming the obvious; that the new pathway was friggin&rsquo; scary and meant possible failure, higher risk and the chance of losing face. It meant consistently being outside of mycomfort zone for a while. Naming these things seems so obvious, but it was a profoundly helpful exercise.</li><li> <strong>  Return to why. </strong>  Again. And again. And again. Why are you doing this? What is likely to happen if you don&rsquo;t change? What are the consequences of inaction and staying your current course. What are the benefits of trimming the sails and setting sail towards a different, possibly brighter sunset? On a scale of one to ten, how important is this? When you ask these sorts of questions, it will bring you back to your true north. It will sustain you when you hit rough seas. It will build resilience. It will connect you with that initial conviction.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t do it alone. </strong>  When I struck the wobbly patch this week, and my conviction was as compelling as a hung jury, I turned to a friend who I count on will tell me how it is. It was what I <i>   needed </i>  to hear, not just what I  <i>  wanted </i>  to hear. Outtake? Turn to peeps who return you to point 3. A captain of a ship doesn&rsquo;t sail it on her own. What resources do you have at your disposal that you are forgetting? People, frameworks, a mentor, books even? Who is your support crew?</li><li> <strong>  Stay the course. </strong>  Practice courage. I&rsquo;m learning that there is magic in the metaphorical pause, the energy of just &lsquo;holding&rsquo; when we find ourselves in that place of discomfort, when we meet the shadow of our ambition, or ourselves. When we stay the course, when we hold on, trim the sails, dig deep, or even merely forgo giving up, that&rsquo;s where the magic, learning and breakthrough occurs. <br/>  </li><p> My father, a keen yachtie who died recently, used to say to me as a child when were together in his yacht, &ldquo;Suzi, prepare to come about&hellip;Hold&hellip;Hold&hellip;Hold&hellip;Leo!&rdquo; (Which for you non-yachties, means &ndash; &ldquo;stay still, stay still, stay&hellip;and now move to the other side of the boat!&rdquo;)</p><p> As I struggle this week with staying the course towards where I need and want to head, I sense him whispering to me &ndash; &ldquo;Hold&hellip;. Hold&hellip;. Hold&hellip;.&rdquo;.</p><p> So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p><p> Stay the course.</p><p> I&rsquo;m going to hold.</p><p> <b>  <i>   What &ldquo;staying the course&rdquo; are you facing right now?  </i> </b></p><p> <b>  <i>   And, what helps you &ldquo;hold&rdquo;?  </i> </b></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-07 22:14:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-07 22:14:00.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_TZmTfn6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-stay-the-course-even-when-doing-so-holds-doubt-difficulty-and-discomfort/\", \"post_id\": \"11608\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-07 22:14:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-07 22:14:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-stay-the-course-even-when-doing-so-holds-doubt-difficulty-and-discomfort\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11607\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5660\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Stay-the-Course-Even-When-Doing-So-Holds-Doubt-Difficulty-and-Discomfort.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"768\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465390800,"author_id":467,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5439,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Middle-Market Companies Are the Strongest Drivers of the U.S. Economy","link":"why-middle-market-companies-are-the-strongest-drivers-of-the-u-s-economy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Often huge conglomerates garner the greatest attention. However, middle-market companies are the strongest drivers of the U.S. economy.</p><h3> Global economic growth is nearing a five-year low.</h3><p> <br/> Mid-sized entrepreneurial firms are nimble, flexible and capable of maximizing opportunities. Collectively, their worldwide impact is huge.</p><p> The middle-market &ndash; typically $100 million to $1 billion in revenues &ndash; is actually more accurately defined by non-financial characteristics. Defining qualities for these companies: 1) private ownership and 2) providers of specialized products or services.</p><p> The U.S. is the global leader of mid-market companies. (1) Approximately 55,700 companies contribute 17 million jobs &ndash; 13% of U.S. employment &ndash; and $1.7 trillion in revenues (2012). Nationally, wholesale and retail represent the greatest number of companies.</p><p> Often what makes mid-market companies &lsquo;tick&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t well understood. Example, when evaluating obstacles to potential expansion, it&rsquo;s far more important to determine whether the company would lose key advantages driving today&rsquo;s success (e.g. agility) than to use revenues to gauge barriers &ndash; a typical assessment method.</p><h3> <strong>  Distinguishing Characteristics </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Typically these firms are specialists working directly with customers/clients </strong> &ndash; not through a third party. Therefore, their understanding of their customers&rsquo; businesses &ndash; and needs &ndash; is deep and broad. Given their entrepreneurial and problem-solving mentality, they readily adapt to new trends that better serve their customers.</li><li> <strong>  The considerable understanding they possess in their areas of specialty can sometimes create risks when they consider expansion outside that area of specialty. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They lack the deep pockets of large corporations. </strong> Any sizable failure &ndash; products/services, new geographic market &ndash; can create serious financial distress.</li><li> <strong>  Large companies often outbid them for desired talent. </strong> And, when expansion is desired, having the right talent in place is critical.</li><h3> <strong>  Successful Growth </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> When mid-market companies successfully grow, it&rsquo;s often due to:</p><li> Extensive preplanning &ndash; detailed plan of action, contingencies, serious consideration of risks and their potential impact</li><li> Inclusion of all relevant stakeholders &ndash; senior leadership, board and often potential customers</li><li> Early inclusion of banking partners &ndash; working together to determine how much capital is needed and parameters for availability</li><p> Ways mid-market companies can mitigate some risks:</p><li> Begin with small and/or short-term tests/experiments &ndash; learn and adjust</li><li> Work closely with customers, offering them incentives to be a &lsquo;beta&rsquo; for new products/services (inclusive of sharing data they collect)</li><li> Consider partners/collaborators &ndash; approach suppliers, customers or others that would benefit from the expansion and discuss possibilities (with a NDA in place)</li><h3> <strong>  Primary Ways Mid-Market Companies Drive Growth (2, 3, 4) </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Market diversification &ndash; based on factors of importance to customer base <br/> a. Quick turnaround on custom orders <br/> b. Ability to handle small jobs/low volumes efficiently <br/> c. Expansion into niches adjacent to the primary niche where the learning curve is low and/or needs are essentially the same <br/> d. Ensure no customer uses beyond an established amount of capacity; identify and profile other customers to serve and grow</li><li> Innovation <br/> a. Identify other needs for products/services you offer <br/> b. Engage frontline employees in ideation sessions; they often have ideas that aren&rsquo;t typically heard <br/> c. Create a flexible, yet formal, innovation process that operates on an ongoing basis</li><li> Continuous Improvement Programs <br/> a. Based on improvements, identify what additional customers can be served <br/> b. Grow niche markets already being served, profitably <br/> c. Solve the issues driving why you lose orders to competitors</li><h3> <strong>  Looking Forward </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Given the importance of mid-market companies to the health of the U.S. economy, understanding needs, obstacles, and actively positioning for growth is crucial.</p><p> Consider hosting a series of facilitated sessions with like-minded business owners representing varied markets, customer bases, products vs. services, can bring to light a variety of potential opportunities in a non-competitive setting.</p><h3> <strong>  Action Items: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Evaluate your company&rsquo;s &ldquo;key advantages&rdquo; that help your company succeed. </strong> Ensure they are 1) protected, 2) enhanced whenever feasible and 3) fully utilized for competitive advantage.</li><li> <strong>  Assess across different customer segments the primary reasons your company &ldquo;wins&rdquo; relative to competition, and reasons your company &ldquo;loses&rdquo; competitively. </strong> To what extent can the &ldquo;winning&rdquo; reasons be amplified, and the &ldquo;losing&rdquo; reasons minimized? Is it possible &ldquo;losing&rdquo; sometimes occurs not because your company lacks whatever the customer seeks? They simply were not aware of your capabilities in that area?</li><li> <strong>  Are there potential differentiating factors from your competitors that you&rsquo;ve not yet fully put in place? </strong> Tailor your offering as closely as possible to illustrate the benefits of importance to customers where your offering exceeds what your competitors are capable of offering.</li><li> <strong>  Ensure your potential &ldquo;partner&rdquo; relationships are being well cultivated </strong> &ndash; key customers, potential new customers, bankers, community leaders&hellip;</li><li> <strong>  If not already in place, evaluate the potential value of an advisory board made up of those with expertise in areas not currently available within your business </strong> , but of importance when considering growth opportunities.</li><strong> Sources:</strong><br/>1.

{"original_id":5440,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Media and Selling – Does it Really Work?","link":"social-media-and-selling-does-it-really-work","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Social media is all the rage right now and for good reason: </strong>  We are all social beings and with virtually unlimited access to reviews, opinions, updates, people, information, etc, it would be foolish not to plug into it all and leverage this tool to make connections, make better decisions, learn about companies, products and options, and gain an edge in our personal and professional lives.  And we all do.</p><p> <strong>  Social media has changed our lives in many ways, and it&rsquo;s changed the way we make buying decisions as well </strong> .  If you&rsquo;re like most people today, you probably search several sites, read reviews, look for deals and coupons and then think about it before you make a decision to buy.  It&rsquo;s obviously changed the way your prospects buy as well and that leads us to the million dollar question: Exactly how beneficial is social media in helping you sell more of your products and services? </p><p> To hear the social media pundits talk about it, they make it seem that without a strong and sustained presence and strategy in social media, you will get left in the dust.  They promise that if you just write your profile properly on LinkedIn and join enough groups (and are active enough in those groups), get enough people to Like you on Facebook, and spend the right amount of time and activities on other appropriate social networking sites, then you&rsquo;ll have all the business and referrals you&rsquo;ll ever need.  Ah, the promise of this global paradise is enticing, isn&rsquo;t it?  </p><h3> But does it work? </h3><p> <br/> To answer that, you just have to ask yourself this:   <strong>  How much of your business last month came as a direct result of your involvement in social media?   </strong>  </p><p> If you&rsquo;re like most of the companies and sales reps I speak with, it&rsquo;s less than 5%.  If that matches up with your results, then you understand why it&rsquo;s important for you to use social media carefully and intelligently.  That means two things: 1) Don&rsquo;t let it soak up all of your time (face it, it&rsquo;s addictive!), and 2) Get the information you need and then do what you do best: prospect, qualify and close decision makers.  </p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it.  While social media, company marketing and referrals are all great ways of meeting prospects, <strong>   the only real activity that is directly under your control is to pick up the phone and call someone. </strong>   In fact, the most successful sales reps in all the industries I work with still make the most amount of outbound calls (either cold calls, warm calls to existing prospects and customers, or follow up calls to prospects identified in a carefully orchestrated social media campaign).  </p><p> Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  Social media is a great tool and I use it all the time.  What I&rsquo;m saying is don&rsquo;t confuse being busy in social media as the same thing as being busy at what you&rsquo;re hired to do &ndash; prospect and close business.  In other words, identify where you get most of your business from and then do more of that.  And for most successful sales teams, that means identify the best leads and then pick up the phone and make a qualifying call.  </p><p> Let me use a personal example.  There are many ways for me to generate leads and deals in my business as a sales consultant.  I&rsquo;ve spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours pursuing one new &ldquo;distraction&rdquo; after another.  I&rsquo;ve pursued social media, pay per click advertising, webinars with associations, multi-level marketing deals, joined endless groups, etc.  And while all these avenues bring me some results, nothing makes me more money than picking up the phone and calling on prospects and current customers.

These conflicts can cost retirement savers 50% of their nest egg.</p><p> &ldquo;Investors left with 50% of their retirement nest egg cannot retire with dignity and financial security,&rdquo; said Kathleen M. McBride, Chair of The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard. &ldquo;The DOL Fiduciary Rule is enormously beneficial to millions of Americans who work and sacrifice to save for their own retirement.  As a nation, we ought to be encouraging retirement security and the best outcomes for hard-working retirement investors, not allowing broker-dealers and insurance companies to systematically fleece them. &rdquo;</p><p> The new DOL Fiduciary Rule requires advice to be from a fiduciary, in the best interest of retirement investors and retirement plans. Firms and fiduciary investment advisors who have the privilege of working in the best interest of retirement investors will earn reasonable compensation instead of unreasonably high compensation that is literally at the expense of the investor&rsquo;s nest egg.</p><p> <strong>  Thousands of fiduciaries already serve retirement investors and plans. </strong>  There are 11,400 Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) firms serving as fiduciaries to more than 30 million investors, across all types and sizes of accounts. RIAs manage or advise on $67 Trillion in assets and employ 750,000 individuals.  <strong>  We know the fiduciary model works. It is workable, and it is profitable, it is sustainable and it is in the best interest of the investor. </strong></p><p> The DOL considered thousands of comments over more than six years, and incorporated many substantive suggestions into the rule. DOL held hundreds of meetings and calls with stakeholders, testified before Congress, and heard testimony from all who requested to testify.</p><p> <strong>  Under the old retirement rules, </strong>  non-fiduciary brokers and insurance agents &ndash;  even though they call themselves advisors and their firms advertise they provide advice in the investor&rsquo;s best interest  &ndash; are able to escape fiduciary duty and sell high cost and even harmful securities to investors who thought they were getting bona fide advice in their best interest. The special interests&rsquo; lawsuits are meant to keep this harmful status quo.</p><p> <strong>  If the lawsuits prevail, high commissions and back-door payments would continue to be harvested from the savings of hard-working Americans investing for retirement, </strong>  flowing to banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds and insurance companies under the self-serving lawsuits.</p><p> <strong>  Even a delay in implementation of the DOL&rsquo;s Fiduciary Rule would cost investors billions of dollars a month in excess commissions, fees and sub-par investments. </strong></p><p> The Fiduciary Rule requires that recommendations to retirement investors be in their best interest. Several broker-dealers that had opposed the rulemaking have already announced they are making the changes necessary to work within the new DOL Fiduciary Rule.</p><h3> Why is The Department of Labor&rsquo;s Fiduciary Rule Necessary?</h3><p> <br/> The DOL&rsquo;s Fiduciary Rule &ndash; long overdue &ndash; will go further to eliminate harmful conflicts of interest and provide enormous benefits to retirement investors than any legislation since ERISA or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It will benefit investors from all walks of life, no matter their level of wealth, or size of account. And, it will benefit the American economy.</p><li> Investor access to advice will increase, not decrease.</li><li> Currently, investors who do not work with a fiduciary get a sales pitch &ndash; frequently for the products that pay the representative and their firm the most.</li><li> A sales pitch is not advice. <br/>  </li><p> In fact, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  <strong>  brokers do not provide substantive advice. </strong></p><p> In addition, many broker-dealer reps are discouraged from working with smaller investors. But when they do, they are currently not required to provide advice in the investor&rsquo;s best interest.</p><p> The Department of Labor achieved a remarkable balance in its Fiduciary Rule, increasing investor protections while imposing a reasonable level of regulatory oversight on financial advice providers.</p><p> The loopholes that DOL was tasked with closing permit the systematic overcharging of America's retirees&rsquo; nest eggs, allowing companies to siphon off half of a retirement nest egg over the years.</p><p> Just 2% in excess commissions or fees reduces retirees&rsquo; nest eggs by at least 50%. As investors save during their working years, just 1% in excess fees strips out 28% of their nest egg.</p><p> <strong>  The DOL Fiduciary Rule should be implemented without any delay or interference from those in the industry that put their own profits ahead of retirement savers&rsquo; nest eggs. </strong></p><p> Investors who want to find a fiduciary now can look for a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) firm. RIAs already provide fiduciary advice to all of their clients, including retirement investors, and have done so for decades.</p><p> Investors can print out a set of questions, the Fiduciary Oath, to ask a prospective (or current) adviser. If an adviser will not sign the Fiduciary Oath, the investor should seek an adviser who will.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-08 14:42:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-08 14:42:39.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_UNkM6f0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/special-interests-lobby-courts-in-best-interest-of-banks-brokers-and-insurers-not-retirement-investors/\", \"post_id\": \"11613\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-08 14:42:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-08 14:42:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"special-interests-lobby-courts-in-best-interest-of-banks-brokers-and-insurers-not-retirement-investors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11612\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5663\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Special-Interests-Lobby-Courts-in-Best-Interest-of-Banks-Brokers-and-Insurers-NOT-Retirement-Investors.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"637\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465477200,"author_id":265,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5443,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A New Era For Goldman Sachs And Performance Appraisals","link":"a-new-era-for-goldman-sachs-and-performance-appraisals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Goldman Sachs, one of the world's leading financial firms, is yet another Fortune 500 company to overhaul its performance management process. The company faced the blunt end of the financial crises, with the majority of the capital heavily invested in risky housing loans. As a result, the U.S government had to bail the company out. However, the level of problems ran deeper than the their ability to make sound financial judgments, and attract young talent. In recent years, the firm has been accused of simply chasing the green back to get ahead. In fact, a resignation letter  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html?hp=&amp;version=meter+at+5&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\" target=\"_blank\">  penned </a>  by a previous employee, outlined just how bad the culture got at a place that was [sic] &ldquo;built on teamwork, integrity and humility&rdquo;.</p><h3> A Culture in Crises</h3><p> <br/> The letter went to say that it was Goldman Sachs&rsquo; culture that led the company to 143 years of success. According to Greg Smith &ldquo;I look around today and see virtually no trace of the culture that made me love working for this firm for many years&rdquo;. The work environment which was supposed to reflect innovation, trust and always putting the customer interests first, started to veer off course.</p><p> At the core of the challenge was the notorious system of stack ranking, which time and time again has shown to create disengaged employees and  <a href=\"http://www.feedback.tips/receiving-constructive-feedback-for-employees-from-managers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  unhealthy internal competition </a> . Goldman Sachs used a system of 360 degree reviews, which involved seniors from all layers of the organisation. Typically, an employee was rated by 15 people: 3 peers, 9 seniors, one junior and 2 &lsquo;external reviewers&rsquo;. These reviews were then communicated to each line manager. The problem was that these managers would then further discuss the employee's performance behind closed doors to determine the overall rating that each individual would get. Nine meant the employee outperformed and out shown their peers, while one essentially meant you were shown the door.</p><p> The numbers represented a forced-curve review system, where 40 percent were told they were doing &lsquo;okay&rsquo;, and the bottom 5 percent were fired every year. This review process, as it has shown from other  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/why-adobe-got-rid-of-performance-reviews-360-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  countless examples </a> , is entirely demotivating and does not reflect the fast paced nature of today&rsquo;s generation. As <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/deloitte-joins-adobe-and-accenture-in-dumping-performance-reviews-360-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Deloitte </a>  pointed out, the whole process takes an average of 28 hours per employee per year. It&rsquo;s no surprise then that a number of other companies have started to remove this cumbersome process for a much more agile and continuous process.</p><h3> Moving over to Continuous feedback</h3><p> <br/> It turns out, not even those working in the the numbers game enjoy being reduced to a digit. Goldman Sachs conducted a company wide survey to understand how each employee perceived the current culture and the way each employee was reviewed. The response was unanimous. Employees wanted more frequent feedback that would support their professional development.</p><p> &ldquo;We strive to create an environment where our people can perform to their fullest potential. ... Providing high-quality and ongoing feedback is at the heart of our culture, and is an important investment we make in our people,\" said the CEO,  Lloyd Blankfein</p><p> Like other companies, Goldman is trying to streamline the laborious process of performance reviews and create a work culture that is once again focused on personal growth and development. The new platform the company will start using will reflect that of a growth mindset, where individuals are able to understand where they are going wrong and constantly realign their efforts to the company's vision.</p><p> The new platform allows employees to solicit feedback on a continuous basis whenever the opportunity arises. Starting in this year, the new platform will require managers to give a written summary of their employees, accompanied with a rating of either outstanding, good, or needs improvement. Ranking a year of employee performance on a numerical scale can be tough on all employees, however, it&rsquo;s the younger generation that feel particularly moved to change it.</p><p> This Millennial generation is  <a href=\"http://surgerecruitment.com/what-makes-millennials-tick/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  constantly </a>  looking to grow and improve their skills, and prove to the older generation that they are more than capable of fulfilling managerial roles. Furthermore, this generation is not worried about loyalty when it comes to employment. In fact, a PWC  <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/services/consulting/documents/millennials-at-work.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  survey </a>  found that 75 percent of interviewed millennials believed that they will have between two and five employers during their lifetime. It&rsquo;s no secret that the banking sector has been failing to attract new talent since the wake of the financial crises of 2008. MBAs from top business schools are  <a href=\"http://news.efinancialcareers.com/se-en/189161/exodus-talent-biggest-challenge-facing-investment-banks-now/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  increasingly </a>  choosing to go into technology roles over investment banking, despite the fact that financial services firms continue to offer the highest number of opportunities.</p><h3> Solutions </h3><p> <br/> A greater focus on employee growth is important to a company's culture. Implementing a system that assists all aspects of the performance management cycle is vital to understanding the health of the organisation.  <a href=\"http://www.impraise.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Impraise  </a> helps companies move from the annual performance review to continuous feedback. Managers can regularly check in with their team members, to understand how they are advancing, and what might be hindering their progress. Creating transparency nurtures a deeper sense of trust between employer and employee.</p><p> Yet, information on the company&rsquo;s activities alone is not enough. As employees are essential to the ongoing activities of the organisation, it's imperative they are allowed to have a say on the direction the company is going in. What&rsquo;s more, gathering feedback from employees regularly, gives employees the ability to track their progress and see where their learning areas may lie .

What struck me most was that although they couldn&rsquo;t have been more different &ndash; there was the proverbial red suspenders guy, the quiet shy guy, the newbie etc ---- they shared one common practice: each prospected every single day and met people they didn&rsquo;t know before.</p><p> Today, as consultants to the financial community, the question we get most often from advisors is, &ldquo;where and how do I get prospects?&rdquo;</p><p> We tell them: &ldquo;first you need to get your head wrapped around the notion that getting a flow of prospects is not simply about acquiring a list of names. If it were that easy, the phone book would suffice. Effective prospecting is hard work. For those willing to put in the time and effort, the rewards are gratifying &ndash; and prospecting can be made easier.&rdquo;</p><p> Here are three surefire steps to make prospecting easier.</p><h3> 1. Understand that you are a sales person, not a portfolio manager</h3><p> <br/> Advisors have to do a lot more than be great advisors or portfolio managers &ndash; they have to be great sales people. That means devoting time to prospecting each and every day.</p><h3> 2. Targeting makes prospecting easier</h3><p> <br/> Getting focused on a smaller well-defined group that you are familiar with is easier and more effective than trying to sell to everyone. Pick a group you&rsquo;ve already succeeded with from your existing client list.</p><h3> 3. Connecting with people means having an interest in what interests them</h3><p> <br/> Once you have identified the group you are comfortable working with, you can start to connect with them where they normally congregate. You&rsquo;d be surprised how many groups are regularly looking for informed speakers (the value add to their members).</p><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> Prospecting is hard work: It requires a sales mindset and a commitment, an targeted approach makes it easier, as does connecting with people in the group around their interests.</p><p> <strong>  In the next 3 blogs, we will discuss each of these steps in greater detail.

{"original_id":5445,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: 9 Tips for Planning the Best Summer Vacation Ever","link":"advisors-9-tips-for-planning-the-best-summer-vacation-ever","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a successful financial professional, you have chosen one of the most challenging professions in the world. Entrepreneur, financial authority and community leader are among the many hats you may wear on a daily basis. The work you do for your clients, family, self and community is vitally important. You owe yourself and your loved ones meaningful time away.</p><p> Here are my 9 tips for planning the best summer vacation ever:</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to plan your trip. </h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways to turn a peaceful vacation into a stress-producing activity is waiting too long to plan. Worrying about finding vacant hotel rooms and paying last minute prices for airline tickets is almost certain to raise your blood pressure. Plus, when you give yourself at least a few weeks to notice, you can more easily coordinate priorities and coverage with assistants, teammates or co-workers.</p><h3> 2. There is no such thing as &ldquo;lost production&rdquo;. </h3><p> <br/> In fact, I would argue that you gain productivity by taking time away. Burnout and exhaustion can be much more costly than time away from your business. Good planning and a well run team will keep you from missing a beat.</p><h3> 3. Watch out for the &ldquo;long weekends&rdquo; trap. </h3><p> <br/> Long weekends are great, but in my opinion a real vacation should be at least 9 days long, simply a week plus a weekend. It takes that long to truly get your mind away from business. Too often advisors tell me they can&rsquo;t take a vacation, but to make up for it they&rsquo;re planning several long weekends. This may work for some, but my advice is take the long weekends AND a long vacation. You deserve it!</p><h3> 4. You can do something spectacular or do nothing at all. </h3><p> <br/> We all relax in different ways at different times. Sometimes an exhilarating trip exploring faraway places is just the right medicine, while at other times a quiet week with great company and a good book is all you need. As you select your vacation destination, decide which alternative will have the most restorative power.</p><h3> 5. Money doesn&rsquo;t necessarily buy happiness. </h3><p> <br/> A great vacation doesn&rsquo;t have to break the bank. We often skip over destinations which are in close proximity to our homes in favor of more exotic locations. Rent a lake house within a few hours of your locale or visit tourist spots in your neighboring states. You may be surprised with the treasures you uncover.</p><h3> 6. Stay in the moment, enjoy your companions. </h3><p> <br/> My most memorable vacations have been highlighted by the quality of time spent with family and friends. A vacation should be time away from both work and the distractions of everyday life. When you are truly relaxed, rainy days at the beach playing board games with your kids can easily measure up to the awe-sharing moments of seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time.</p><h3> 7. Avoid email, telephones and the financial news. </h3><p> <br/> Your team, your clients, the financial markets and life in general will go on without you, so don&rsquo;t try to be indispensable. Give an emergency number to someone who won&rsquo;t abuse it and vacation with confidence. Leave your computer and smartphone at home. Sure, periodically checking voicemail and email may seem like a practical strategy to avoid post-vacation overload, but this routine will almost certainly infringe on your relaxation. (Bonus tip &ndash; Schedule the first day you&rsquo;re back in the office as &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; day, no appointments or meetings.)</p><h3> 8. Send your ultimate clients a postcard. </h3><p> <br/> Several of my coaching clients have tried this idea and they are overwhelmed by the positive reaction they received from their clients.This should be the only &ldquo;work&rdquo; you do while you&rsquo;re away. Simply pack a list with the names and addresses of your ultimate clients (along with postcard stamps) and send them a brief note from your first stop. You will be taking another step toward  <a href=\"http://ultimateclientexperience.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;Delivering the Ultimate Client Experience&rdquo; </a> .</p><h3> 9. Buy your teammates souvenirs. </h3><p> <br/> You should thank the folks who keep your business on track while you are vacationing. The more you can personalize the gift the better, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to buy multiple copies of the same item. As they say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the thought that counts.&rdquo;</p><p> Some of these ideas may make you nervous. But give them a try and you will have a vacation filled with unexpected pleasures. Have fun!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-08 16:54:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-08 16:54:06.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_CyDOpWS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-9-tips-for-planning-the-best-summer-vacation-ever/\", \"post_id\": \"11621\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-08 16:54:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-08 16:54:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-9-tips-for-planning-the-best-summer-vacation-ever\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11620\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5667\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Advisors-9-Tips-for-Planning-the-Best-Summer-Vacation-Ever.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"529\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465473600,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5447,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Six Ways to Support Friction Free Referrals","link":"six-ways-to-support-friction-free-referrals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> For professional services firms and wealth managers, referrals from clients and their professional peer group has traditionally been the mainstay of new business generation.</p><p> However, ask most firms and they may not even measure or manage around this dynamic, often leaving fee earners and relationship managers to continue in the driving seat drawing support where they chose or are able from marketing, PR, operations and so on.</p><p> Yet in the last 10 years clients have become more demanding and more prone to conduct more of their purchasing and decision-making online.  Firms have often struggled to reorientate their resources to respond to this changing dynamic.</p><p> It is important that firms audit effectively the what where and how of prospects and referrals, (including asking clients and peers for feedback), that they organise around the new insights they uncover rather than outdated assumptions, and then provide coaching and training for everyone from front of house staff to fee earners to help them respond more effectively in order to encourage prospects through the increasingly erratic journey through the sales funnel.</p><p> Six commons issues that our auditing frequently highlights are:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Be clear what your value proposition is </strong></h3><p> <br/> I prefer to encourage firms to think about what makes them distinct rather than uniquely different which is generally a much harder thing to pin down for service providers unless they have a genuine client segment focus such as female client, tech entrepreneurs, particular professions and so on.  I also prefer value proposition to brand &ndash; brand is often a nebulous concept that many firms struggle to develop or embed meaningfully beyond their logo and corporate livery.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Make sure your clients are clear. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Realistically clients can&rsquo;t refer you if they don&rsquo;t know how you can help whom. Your clients may have come to you for a myriad of reasons and their viewpoint on your organisation will be coloured by the nature of their own interactions and relationships &ndash; it won&rsquo;t be helicopter and it may not be up-to-date. They also don&rsquo;t want their friends, family and business associates turned away creating embarrassment for all concerned if they try and match-make inappropriately.  Firms struggle to play back to the outside world what defines their ideal client but those that invest in client research and feedback find this easier as they have more pertinent and engaging insights to share.  Case studies and testimonials can also be helpful as a short hand.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Invest in client experience </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Goods are consumed, services are experienced,&rdquo; as professional services management guru David Maister pointed out 20 years ago.  He was amongst one of the first to highlight the importance of client service particularly when clients cannot easily judge technical competence and because improving the quality of work can be costly and harder to accomplish than demonstrably improving the quality of service eg through instilling a more responsive attitude in professional staff.</p><p> Customer experience management can be described as &ldquo;the practice of designing and reacting to client interactions to meet or exceed their expectations and, thus, improve retention, and increase their propensity to do business with you and refer you to others and/or be active advocates of your firm.&rdquo; or, as Bruce Springsteen put it: &ldquo;Getting an audience is hard. Sustaining an audience is hard. It demands a consistency of thought, of purpose, and of action over a long period of time.&rdquo;</p><p>  Without a clear view on your client service methodology and procedures and mechanisms for ensuring quality of service, firms will struggle to please, impress and engage their clients and professional peer group. <strong>    </strong></p><h3> <strong>  4. Identify referable moments </strong></h3><p> <br/> While a large majority of professional services firms talk about the importance of referrals to their business growth, few have a structured programme in support of referrals.</p><p> As part of any CX programme firms should consider how to integrate extra support for encouraging referrals. While engaged clients will refer more often, sometimes they need a helping hand, and your peer group certainly does.</p><p> Pockets of good practice often exist &ndash; particularly around larger key client relationships and or key referral relationships with other professional firms &ndash; but many still leave responsibility with individual fee earners/front office staff or teams, and fail to institutionalise best practice and maximise the opportunities across the firm.</p><p> A more ruthless tracking of where new business comes from and how is a prerequisite, and even in firms without good CRM systems there are always ways to do this better and it may involve asking new clients about their journey to your firm as it will unlikely to have been linear.  Opportunities to refocus activity more productively can almost always be found as a result and this process is also a good way of starting your clients&rsquo; engagement journey with you and your firm.  Sharing best practice is also key and experience tells me this is best done in small groups and regular sessions &ndash; I fear no-one&rsquo;s looking at your knowledge sharing portal/intranet&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  5. Making sure whatever online due diligence prospects do, you pass the test! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Ten years ago there was almost a badge of honour in some quarters in not really having an online footprint.  I still know smaller niche professional firms who have only just, reluctantly, put websites together (or redone sites that didn&rsquo;t work on a smart phone). What used to imply a discrete standing in their market now just comes over as slightly disorganised or a bit out of touch.  It also makes recruitment harder.</p><p> Client engagement and their confidence in referring you needs to be backed up by their confidence that when you are Googled &ndash; individually or as a firm &ndash; you will emerge as a firm that&rsquo;s present in the obvious places (doesn&rsquo;t have to be everywhere but LinkedIn is usually a must-have), being clear about its value proposition, being seen to have a view on the key needs of its clients and the key topics of the day. If it doesn&rsquo;t, for many prospects the journey will stop &ndash; the friction in their referral journey being too great to forgive your firm for being a paler shadow than their need for reassurance and confidence in you requires.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/when-buyers-rule-out-referrals.png\" width=\"652\"/></p><h3> <strong>  6. Make sure you don&rsquo;t drop the catch </strong></h3><p> <br/> A referral may have been made but the route may be anything other than linear.  From Googling you, looking at your LinkedIn profile, trying to find your telephone number on your website, office address, trying to get through switchboard or general enquiry email, or worse still complicated enquiry forms, all these things hamper a smooth customer journey and affect a prospect's decision set.  You may never catch a referral that&rsquo;s been passed to you if somewhere the ball&rsquo;s been dropped.</p><p> Auditing and mapping prospect journeys across all channels is key.  Managing this sort of first contact activity is also a useful precursor to the roll out of wider client experience programmes as it is simpler, more containable and the return on investment easier to quantify in the first instance.</p><p> As Seth Godin says in  All Marketers Are Liars: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s every point of contact that matters&hellip;..if you can cover all the possible impressions and allow the consumer to make them into a coherent story, you win.&rdquo;</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-08 18:23:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-08 18:23:06.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_jrrK6Os.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-ways-to-support-friction-free-referrals/\", \"post_id\": \"11626\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-08 18:23:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-08 18:23:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-ways-to-support-friction-free-referrals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11624\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5669\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Six-Ways-to-Support-Friction-Free-Referrals.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"712\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465466400,"author_id":167,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5448,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is India the New China?","link":"is-india-the-new-china","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A &ldquo;slow-growth trap.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) described the global economy last week in its latest  <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Global Economic Outlook. </a>  The group sees world GDP advancing only 3 percent in 2016, the same as last year, with a slight bump up to 3.3 percent in 2017.Catherine Mann, the OECD&rsquo;s chief economist, urged policymakers around the world to prioritize structural reforms that &ldquo;enhance market competition, innovation and dynamism,&rdquo; as monetary policy has been used alone as the main tool for far too long. The longer the global economy remains in this &ldquo;slow-growth trap,&rdquo; Mann said, the harder it will become to revive market forces.This is precisely in-line with what I, and many of my colleagues, have stressed for months now. To push the economy on a high-growth path, we need structural fiscal reforms, both here and abroad. One need only look at the global purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) to see that manufacturing conditions have been slowing for the past several years since the financial crisis. The PMI in May registered a 50.0, which Markit Economics describes as &ldquo;lethargic&rdquo; and &ldquo;low gear.&rdquo; <img alt=\"\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/global-manufacturing.png\" width=\"648\"/> U.S. manufacturing also saw further weakness in May, with its PMI reading falling to 50.7, more than a six-year low. The eurozone&rsquo;s PMI fell to 51.5, a three-month low. Meanwhile, the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI came in at 49.2, still below the neutral 50 threshold.It&rsquo;s clear that policymakers need to address slow growth with smarter fiscal policies, lower taxes and streamlined regulations. Zero and negative interest rate policies are taking their final gasp as far as what they can accomplish.One of the bright spots continues to be India, whose own manufacturing sector expanded for the fifth straight month in May. The country&rsquo;s GDP advanced an impressive 7.9 percent in the first quarter, following 7.3 percent year-over-year growth in 2015. This helps it retain its position as the world&rsquo;s fastest growing major economy. Credit Suisse ranked India first in April&rsquo;s  <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fcVr8QjRpz8J:https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/emerging-consumer-survey-2016-en.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Emerging Consumer Survey 2016, </a>  noting that &ldquo;Indian consumers stand out among their emerging market peers with higher confidence about their current and future finances and relatively lower inflation expectations.&rdquo;Many analysts are referring to this as the &ldquo;Modi effect,&rdquo; in honor of  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/narendra-modi-pro-business-policies-strong-sectors-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, </a>  elected two years ago on promises to reinvigorate business growth by cutting red tape and increasing infrastructure spending. Modi, who is scheduled to visit Washington this week, has had limited success at this point. But to be fair, India&rsquo;s challenges run deep, and it will take quite a bit longer to make substantial changes to the country&rsquo;s notorious regulations and corruption.</p><h3> India&rsquo;s Oil Demand Ready for Takeoff</h3>Make no mistake, China&rsquo;s oil demand is still massive, second only to the U.S. But it has begun to contract in recent months, and there to offset the difference is India, who is expected to have the fastest growing demand for crude between now and 2040, according to the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/currentreport/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> International Energy Agency (IEA).</a> India&rsquo;s consumption stood at 4.5 million barrels a day in March, which is up considerably from an average of 4 million barrels a day in 2015. The Asian country represented a whopping 30 percent of total global consumption growth in the first quarter. This makes it the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;star performer&rdquo; growth market, a role occupied until recently by China. India is now poised to overtake Japan as the second largest oil consumer in Asia, if this hasn&rsquo;t already happened.<img alt=\"\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/indias-oil.png\" width=\"633\"/>Contributing to India&rsquo;s oil binge are policy changes that make its economy resemble China&rsquo;s in the late 1990s, soon before its industrial boom. Compared to other major economies, India&rsquo;s per capita consumption of oil is relatively low, as ownership of automobiles and motorcycles&mdash;many Indians&rsquo; preferred mode of personal transportation&mdash;is still developing, with penetration at merely 144 per 1,000 people. If we look just at passenger cars, the rate is closer to 17 per 1,000 people. (In the U.S., the figure is 850 per 1,000 people.)<img alt=\"\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/vehicle-ownership.png\" width=\"630\"/>This is the exciting part, of course. A couple of months ago I shared with you a factoid from my friend Gianni Kovacevic&rsquo;s book &ldquo;My Electrician Drives a Porsche?&rdquo;, that in 1979 there were only <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/if-youre-not-following-this-energy-trend-youre-being-left-in-the-dust/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 60 privately-owned automobiles</a> in China. Today, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s largest auto market.India&rsquo;s rise appears to be similarly dramatic. In the chart above, courtesy of a March report from the<a href=\"https://www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/indias-oil-demand/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Oxford Institute for Energy Studies,</a> you can see that the number of vehicles driving on Indian roads doubled between 2007 and 2014, thanks not only to an exploding population but also the rise of India&rsquo;s &ldquo;spending class,&rdquo; as Gianni calls it. More than 600 million Indians are <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/600-million-reasons-to-keep-your-eyes-on-india/#.V1CDQf50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> under the age of 25,</a> based on 2014 data, and many in this cohort aspire to have social mobility and the American Dream. The country is now on track to become the third largest auto market by 2020, behind China and the U.S., and obviously this has huge implications for oil consumption.<img alt=\"\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/did-you-know.png\" width=\"635\"/>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-08 19:02:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-08 19:02:30.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_c17QoQi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-india-the-new-china/\", \"post_id\": \"11631\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-08 19:02:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-08 19:02:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-india-the-new-china\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11624\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5670\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Six-Ways-to-Support-Friction-Free-Referrals.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"451\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465484400,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5449,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Feedback You Need, but Don't Get (and Secretly Don't Want)","link":"the-feedback-you-need-but-dont-get-and-secretly-dont-want","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m going to stretch a bit here and assume you are like me - and that we all want to be better. We want to be better workers or managers, hit better targets in our business, be better spouses, friends or members of the community. No matter how good we think we are &ndash; there is always that little nugget in the back of our noggin pushing us to raise the bar just a little bit. And that&rsquo;s good!</p><p> When we try to improve, however, we do so while operating in our own little bubbles, viewing challenges and changes from our own limiting viewpoint, and it affects the lanes we drive in on the improvement highway. We make moves based on what we think is best, without incorporating other perspectives. Without additional feedback, we may end up making decisions that are not supportive of, and in fact may be detrimental to, what we are looking to accomplish. And that&rsquo;s not good!</p><p> External feedback is essential to success and accomplishment, regardless of scenario. However, it&rsquo;s the one item that we struggle to get the most. Why is valid, legitimate, constructive feedback so hard to come by? It&rsquo;s comes down to two buckets: we don&rsquo;t ask for it, for fear of negative feedback; and many people don&rsquo;t like to give it, for fear of splintering a relationship. Just as much as you dislike hearing about your inability to hold a room in a meeting, the person giving you that feedback hates to say it. We want to build relationships, not break them due to misinterpretations, hurt feelings and the like.</p><p> If nobody wants to give feedback and we are afraid of it, yet we need it, how are we to get it? Here are a few important things to know about getting the valid, productive feedback you need to improve:</p><h3> Be open to it</h3><p> <br/> Like, really be open to it. You actually have to want the feedback you get so you can improve. It&rsquo;s a means to an end &ndash; and your desire to improve or succeed has to be greater than your attempts to protect your fractured ego. If you aren&rsquo;t open to receiving feedback, others aren&rsquo;t going to be open to providing it. We need to operate under a &ldquo;learner&rdquo; mindset; feedback is simply information from which we learn about ourselves. &ldquo;Change Your Questions, Change Your Life&rdquo; delves deeper into this &ldquo;learner&rdquo; mindset, and is a book I recommend to all of my clients.</p><h3> Be vulnerable</h3><p> <br/> We claim to want &ldquo;constructive&rdquo; feedback, however what we are really asking for is validation that we are awesome. How often have you asked for constructive feedback, received some that was negative, and then instantly went on the defensive to cover the sting? Open up your guard a little bit. Be prepared to take in feedback, digest it, and spit it out into something useful. There are excellent <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TED talks on vulnerability </a> that really help put things into perspective.</p><h3> You actually have to ask for it</h3><p> <br/> People love to help other people. However sometimes that help needs to be solicited. Swallow your pride and actually ask some trusted individuals for their feedback. Here are two helpful reminders when asking for feedback: Time and Context. First, give that person time to think about how they want to give you feedback. It&rsquo;s the result of a relationship over time, so give them warning. Tell them you are working on something over the coming weeks or months, and you would like their feedback at some point in the future. This way they aren&rsquo;t caught off guard and can pull together the best feedback possible.</p><p> Second, remember that context matters and helps. Explaining that their feedback will help a larger goal (overall self-improvement, strategy change, etc.) makes it less personal and more focused on a task at hand, thus leading people to be more inclined to share their perceptions and feedback.</p><h3> Be aware</h3><p> <br/> Getting good feedback relies on good relationships. Be aware of the actual relationships you are building. But just as important as what is said is what isn&rsquo;t. Feedback comes from different people at different stages of relationships. Read between the lines; not everyone is comfortable telling your cooking is terrible. Reflect on your conversations and your feedback, and see if there is something that people are bouncing around &ndash; and you can move on from there.</p><h3> The assessment route</h3><p> <br/> First person feedback is extremely beneficial, but there are also assessments that can give an additional aspect of feedback to help you be round out your improvement approach. By comparing assessment data (personality, leadership style, market data) with individually received feedback, you can potentially have a more holistic view on whatever it is you are changing.</p><p> Productive feedback can be a scary proposition, but the diversity of perspectives and views is the secret ingredient to successful change and improvement. It&rsquo;s an invaluable and essential component on your path to success. Be genuine in your solicitation of it. Write it down. Create a plan. And use it to put yourself on the right path to positive, sustained personal and professional growth.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-08 19:05:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-08 19:05:46.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_sSczXEQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-feedback-you-need-but-dont-get-and-secretly-dont-want/\", \"post_id\": \"11633\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-08 19:05:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-08 19:05:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-feedback-you-need-but-dont-get-and-secretly-dont-want\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11632\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5671\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Feedback-You-Need-but-Dont-Get-and-Secretly-Dont-Want-.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"922\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465498800,"author_id":232,"chart_url":""}

For investment managers trying to get portfolios to perform over the long haul, there are new ways of investing that allow them to use both in order to see returns.</p><p> Amy Kemp, Senior Analyst at  <a href=\"http://business.nasdaq.com/intel/indexes/smart-beta/dorsey-wright-indexes/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dorsey Wright &amp; Associates </a> , a Nasdaq Company, points out that investing for the long term means shepherding assets through several market cycles. From Dow Jones Industrial Average data she identifies bull and bear markets running roughly every decade over the past 100 years and concludes that a retiree average lifetime of 85 years will hit roughly three of these major bull and bear cycles.</p><p> Investing through these cycles will take not one strategy, but several, acting in somewhat of a relay. Kemp draws an analogy to running a race in the Olympic Games. While the world record for the 400-meter dash in an individual race is 43.18 seconds, a record held by American athlete Michael Johnson, the record for running 400 meters the fastest is set by the Jamaican relay team, which ran the same distance and won, but shaved a whole six seconds off of Johnson&rsquo;s record time.</p><p> Putting together a long-term investment portfolio for a  <a href=\"http://www.business.nasdaq.com/smartbeta/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  smart beta index fund </a>  is similar in scope to a relay team. Just as a relay team hands the baton off from one runner to another, a portfolio can switch focus to be at its most powerful at the appropriate instance.</p><p> Instead of reacting to short term market noise, smart beta models attempt to identify long term trends and adapt. There&rsquo;s not a set time limit for each sector to stay inside or outside of the portfolio, as trends can, in some cases, persist for years.</p><p> Yes, it&rsquo;s about having a diversified portfolio but one that makes sense for what is happening to markets and the economy during that period. Smart beta investing is smart shopping. The vagaries of the market are such that the strongest and most promising investment sectors can quickly become unfashionable. The trick is being prepared to move to the next leg of the race with the right strategy in place.</p><p> For example, in this past decade and a half, we saw the technology bubble burst, and coming out of that period we saw outperformance in energy stocks. Leading up to 2007, we saw long term strength in the financial and real estate sectors, and this past year (2015), the healthcare sector performed well. The strength within those sectors was of varying durations and exhibits the importance of sector rotation.</p><p> A smart beta index fund attempts to adapt to the many twists and turns of the market. Just as the only certainty in the economy is uncertainty, the smart beta index world is uniquely positioned to rotate to areas of strength within the market, as market leadership changes.</p><p> For more information,  <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/GIG_ContactUs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  contact us </a>  and a member of our team will reach out to you directly.</p>Nasdaq&reg; is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

Taking on an associate can be costly from a business perspective as well as a personal-energy perspective.</h3><p> <br/> But if you make the success of your associate a priority, you both benefit.</p><p> Time management is hard for everyone; there are just so many distractions. Recent studies in worker productivity have shown that workers are more productive if they divide up their workday with breaks.</p><p> While you certainly don&rsquo;t want your associates spending too much time taking breaks, you can encourage them to use time blocks, dedicating short periods of time to one task with scheduled breaks between each task.</p><p> In terms of goals, if you don&rsquo;t set goals or if the goals you set are unrealistic, you are setting up your associate adviser for failure. Take the time to determine goals for your associate, and make sure they&rsquo;re clear when you communicate them. For example, tell him or her to spend two hours each day prospecting and documenting that work in the company&rsquo;s customer relationship management program.</p><p> Hand-in-hand with setting goals are motivators. Behavioral psychologists say you need to praise a person six times for every one time you give negative feedback. In my experience, most primary advisers focus on negatives and forget to reward their associates and also tell them what they&rsquo;re doing well. Negatives are not motivating.</p><p> Options for motivators are endless. One of the best things primary advisers can do is to sit down with associates and ask them what motivates them. For example, money might motivate them, in which case you could offer a graduated scale of assets under management or opportunities for profit-sharing. Or maybe your associate wants to attend a conference and needs greater flexibility in his or her schedule.</p><p> Finally, accountability is a two-way street. You have a responsibility to your associate as much as he or she has one to you. So make sure you set up one-on-one meetings with your associate at least once every two weeks. Have a specific agenda for each of these meetings but also use them as a way to find out how they&rsquo;re doing. Ask them how you can help them be successful.</p><p> The more you put into your relationship with your associates and the more you show them that they are a valued and vital part of your practice, the more successful they will be, the happier they will be and the longer they will stay.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-08 20:20:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-08 20:20:38.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_TOSnwFz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-make-associate-advisors-successful/\", \"post_id\": \"11637\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-08 20:20:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-08 20:20:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-make-associate-advisors-successful\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11636\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5674\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Make-Associate-Advisors-Successful.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"376\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465635600,"author_id":334,"chart_url":""}

The type of calorie consumed has an impact on the amount of energy expended by our bodies, making some calories more efficient than others. Similarly, not every dollar is created equal. This notion becomes particularly important to understand when splitting assets in a divorce. Depending on your situation, certain assets may be more valuable than others. Consider the tips below to 'consciously uncouple&rsquo; your finances in a divorce and to improve your financial health in the end.  </p><p> <b>  Don&rsquo;t Take the House If You Can&rsquo;t Afford It. </b> Especially when you have children, it&rsquo;s normal to want to minimize disruption to your normal, everyday life.  But, don&rsquo;t ask for the home if you can&rsquo;t afford to maintain it. Attempting to keep the status quo may not be the best long-term solution. </p><p> <b>  Consider Taxes. </b> Retirement assets (i.e., certain IRA&rsquo;s and 401(k)&rsquo;s) will be taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn and have restrictions as to accessibility. If there are company-sponsored retirement plans to be split (i.e., 401(k) or pension), familiarize yourself with the use of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). You may also pay tax on the sale of property or investments that have increased in value, so understand the after-tax value of the assets before agreeing on the split.</p><p> <b>  Consider Taxes, More. </b> Understand what you could be giving up if you forgo the dependency exemption for tax filing. Head of Household filers pay income tax at a lower tax rate (compared to Single or Married filers), are eligible to claim a higher standard deduction, and may be able to take advantage of other tax credits, depending on income (i.e., Dependent Care Credit or Earned Income Credit). It&rsquo;s well worth spending less than $1,000 to have a CPA determine what you would be giving up in real dollars if you concede this status to your soon-to-be ex. This knowledge could save you thousands annually. </p><p> <b>  Plan for Debts. </b> Consider an indemnity clause in the decree that will allow you to take action if your ex does not pay on a debt. Also, consider a refinancing clause for secured debts (i.e., home or car) to remove your name from any liabilities to be paid by your ex.  </p><p> <b>  Protect Yourself. </b> Just as important as protecting future income in a marriage, have the conversation about protecting child or spousal support payments in the event of death with the use of life insurance.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-08 20:50:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-08 20:50:05.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_1S9IkVH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-consciously-uncouple-your-finances-in-a-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"11643\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-08 20:50:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-08 20:50:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-consciously-uncouple-your-finances-in-a-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11642\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5676\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Consciously-Uncouple-Your-Finances-in-a-Divorce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465480800,"author_id":479,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5454,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Adding Wisdom to Smart Beta Strategies","link":"adding-wisdom-to-smart-beta-strategies","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Smart Beta ETF&rsquo;s have captured the imaginations of the investing public over the past five years, growing to more than 440 ETF&rsquo;s and over $450 billion in assets, according to Morningstar. The growth in names and assets suggests that financial advisors and investors find some value in these strategies. The question that needs to be asked is, &ldquo;By itself, is this a winning strategy?&rdquo;</p><h3> What is Smart Beta?</h3><p> <br/> While traditional indexes consist of a list of securities weighted by overall size, some people have concluded that this weighting presents an advantage for large securities and a disadvantage for small securities. Many investors have concluded that this inequity must create exploitable inefficiencies within the market, bringing about the growth of Smart Beta. Smart Beta strategies involve researching and investing in a specific subset of the overall market that exhibits common attributes. The expectation of Smart Beta strategies is that those shared attributes will produce an investment return superior to the traditional weight-based index discussed above.</p><p> The concept of Smart Beta strategies is not new to the investment world. Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business identified the predictive capacities of certain common factors exhibited within the companies that compose the public markets. They initially ranked companies according to three characteristics: company size, valuation, and price momentum.</p><p> Little has changed in the almost 25 years since Fama and French published their first paper on the topic; these three characteristics remain the primary drivers of most Smart Beta strategies. However, one change has been made: Quality was added as a factor to round out the offering.</p><h3> Good idea run afoul?</h3><p> <br/> Little disagreement exists over the theory that these factors demonstrate an ability to capture excess returns. As mentioned above, the most common explanation of the factors&rsquo; ability suggests that the success of traditional asset-weighted indexing has created exploitable inefficiencies.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/msci-world-factor.png\" width=\"957\"/></p><p> Research into the returns associated with these factors has shown that their generated alpha is inconsistent over time. Ample evidence suggests any one of the factors could lead the market one year only to underperform swiftly the next. The level of volatility, much like the volatility shown in individual securities, calls into question the sustainability of the inefficiency that firms attempt to capture. The results, as shown over time, are excessive trading and poor timing, both of which lead to large costs and an inability to consistently capture the desired inefficiency.</p><p> The single factor return history presented by MSCI (Figure 1) shows the differences in return between Smart Beta strategies and the weight-based index. There are times when a particular strategy will differ so greatly from the index that one can celebrate the results of the bet made. For example, a focus on Momentum in 2011 would have produced a 4% positive absolute return &mdash; before fees and implementation costs &mdash; versus a loss of over 5% by the index. Volatile Alpha Generation</p><p> Approaching the strategy in a different situation, would the bet on Quality in 2008, which resulted in a loss of 38% versus a loss of almost 41% by the index, make you want to crack open a bottle of champagne?</p><p> Figure 1 demonstrates that the factors are fairly consistent over the 16 years presented: each factor detracts from performance about one third of the time. Each has outperformed the standard weight-based index. However, the time frame used can provide a false sense of confidence. In the initial historical view of the factors &mdash; the past 25 years &mdash;Quality demonstrated the best performance. However, in May of 2015, MSCI expanded the timeframe to include the past 40 years. The inclusion of 15 more years in the timeframe caused Quality to fall to the second worst performing factor. Moral of the story: timeframe matters.</p><h3> The Need for Wisdom</h3><p> <br/> In the world of investing, new &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; are frequently marketed as ways to cheat the system and outperform the index. Some may actually work, if one is able to remain consistent over time. However, all too often, the trick fails for a period of time, causing the investment industry to panic, believing their past success is inimitable. This fear appears to reflect the investing majority&rsquo;s incomprehension of the fact that that these factors can be cyclical and coincide to patterns within the business cycle.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/enhanced-value.png\" width=\"537\"/></p><p> A deeper look into the periods of outperformance and underperformance and the corresponding Smart Beta index composition offers some insights and poses questions.</p><p> Is it a coincidence that Value experienced five years of material outperformance during the late stages of the housing and mortgage bubble, when the financial sector represented close to 25% of the value index?</p><p> Additionally, is it a coincidence that the Quality factor experienced its winning streak over the past 15 years during the late stages of the commodity cycle when the Energy, Industrial, and Material sectors averaged a third of the weight of the Quality index?</p><p> The one factor that appears to have a mind of its own is the Momentum factor. This is evident from the volatility in its holdings: Momentum-based sector weightings having the largest swings of all factors. The factor&rsquo;s need to &ldquo;recalibrate&rdquo; each year to mimic the strong momentum experienced by securities may be the reason for its volatile excess return in the early phases of the new century, when markets were going through a period of reconstitution.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Smart Beta techniques open up a level of abstraction to the investing world, offering investors a more efficient method to capture outsized returns in areas of perceived inefficiency. While this may produce desired results over some time periods, the cyclicality of performance witnessed historically may make the capturing of alpha elusive.  So this produces one question: Is the Smart Beta abstraction layer hiding the real inefficiency?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 16:13:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 16:13:58.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_QCAsrtC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/adding-wisdom-to-smart-beta-strategies/\", \"post_id\": \"11647\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 16:13:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 16:13:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"adding-wisdom-to-smart-beta-strategies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11644\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5679\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adding-Wisdom-to-Smart-Beta-Strategies.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1227\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465563600,"author_id":247,"chart_url":""}

Here are a few core lessons:</p><p> <strong>  1)  </strong> <strong>  Benchmark the Best:  </strong> At age 19,  Cassius Clay met George Wagner, a boastful, electrifying, professional wrestler who went by the ring name of Gorgeous George. The man the world would remember as Muhammad Ali was present as Gorgeous George was interviewed at a radio station in Las Vegas. During the interview, Gorgeous George incited the audience with claims of how George would triumph over his upcoming competitor because in George&rsquo;s words he was &ldquo;the greatest wrestler in the world!&rdquo; Gorgeous George purportedly later told Muhammad Ali, &ldquo; A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. So keep on bragging, keep on sassing, and always be outrageous .&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2)  </strong> <strong>  Back-up Your Claims: </strong>  Muhammad Ali made provocative claims that he fulfilled with immense talent and arduous training. His marketing genius was completely aligned with supreme execution.</p><p> <strong>  3)  </strong> <strong>  Take a Stand:  </strong> Muhammad Ali was larger than life because he was willing (in the words of his friends) to &ldquo;follow his heart and  <u>  not </u>  the money.&rdquo; He filtered the world through his values and deeply held convictions. He took actions that, for a time, cost him his title, endorsements, potential incarceration, and the support of many.</p><p> <strong>  4)  </strong> <strong>  Demonstrate Otherness: </strong>  While many people seek &ldquo;fame and fortune&rdquo; for themselves, Muhammad Ali leveraged his fame for the good of others. He viewed success as an obligation to do good in the world.</p><p> <strong>  5)  </strong> <strong>  Remain Positive in the Face of Adversity:  </strong> All of us, to one degree or another, suffer Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.&rdquo; Great leaders like Muhammad Ali inspire us with the grace by which they manage their adversity. For a man with such vitality, strength, and power to lose his physical control and voice &ndash; yet do so without complaint and with extreme gentility, is an inspiration for us all.</p><p> Muhammad Ali was a man, a boxer, a hero for many, and a legendary brand that  <strong>  delivered hope, courage and transformation to those fortunate enough to encounter &ldquo;The Greatest&rdquo; experience. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 16:47:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 16:47:20.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_fImfkW5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-muhammad-ali-experience-5-lessons-to-win-by/\", \"post_id\": \"11649\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 16:47:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 16:47:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-muhammad-ali-experience-5-lessons-to-win-by\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11648\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5680\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Muhammad-Ali-Experience-5-Lessons-to-Win-By_0.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"941\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465617600,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5456,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Happens When Partners No Longer Share the Same Vision","link":"what-happens-when-partners-no-longer-share-the-same-vision","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What happens when partners no longer share the same vision? Does a lack of consensus about the future mean the end of the relationship?</p><p> Advisors are seeing more value in partnerships than ever before, acknowledging that it has become extremely challenging to be a sole practitioner and motivating many to join forces with other like-minded professionals. They are more likely to be managing a client&rsquo;s entire financial life and are expected to be experts on all fronts. And with the nature of the business being heavily relationship-based, advisors must devote a significant amount of time to being in front of clients. Those that successfully enter into partnerships, however, quickly discover that maintaining them has its own challenges.</p><h3> At a Crossroads</h3><p> <br/> Take, for example, partners whose business is at a major crossroads, where they must decide in which direction to take the business next. In this case, the strength of even the best of partnerships is likely to be tested.</p><p> Advisors are almost universally grappling with the desire for more control from their firms, and this phenomenon is forcing many advisors to reevaluate whether they&rsquo;re still at the best place. With more legitimate high-end options from which to choose, it&rsquo;s more likely that even longstanding partners may have differing views.</p><h3> Differing Life-Stages</h3><p> <br/> Partners, especially those at different stages in their professional lives, may be motivated by vastly different priorities. When one partner is contemplating retirement, teams may disagree over the best approach to creating continuity. More firms today offer some form of &ldquo;sunset plan&rdquo; which allows a retiring advisor to monetize to some degree. But when a retiring advisor signs on for this, his partner is effectively tied there as well, at least for the next 5 or so years.</p><h3> Can This Partnership be Saved?</h3><p> <br/> Partnerships have certainly broken up in the midst of facing these choices. Yet partners committed to remaining aligned need to look for creative solutions to meet everyone&rsquo;s needs. Don and Rob, partners for 15 years in a successful and growing practice, are a great example. Over the past 5 years, they talked enthusiastically about leaving their traditional firm to launch an independent high-end wealth management business. They both loved the idea of creating a client-focused practice and were committed to building equity in something they owned, controlled and could ultimately sell.</p><p> However, in recent months, Don has begun to think more about retiring than about building something, and his firm&rsquo;s retirement plan &ndash; while far from ideal &ndash; is starting to look more attractive. Rob, while not prepared to abandon his vision of independence, won&rsquo;t consider leaving Don behind. When Don first shared his reluctance to make a change at this juncture of his career, Rob assumed that he would have to postpone, perhaps indefinitely, his pursuit of becoming an independent business owner. However, they were willing to think out of the box. After some soul searching and consulting with industry experts, they have decided to explore options that support their making a move together to an independent model, while still allowing Don to retire and get paid out under terms he&rsquo;s comfortable with. For Don and Rob, preserving the partnership was the first priority, and with some creativity and compromise, they are committed to finding a solution that meets each of their goals.</p><p> While partnerships are formed from financial advisors who share values and vision, it is in that same space that they can often go astray. Just as in any relationship, individuals change. It is also in that same space that creative solutions emerge to create opportunities that can benefit the partners and the clients. Regular pulse checks and open dialog amongst partners can help to continually align their vision and values and assess any changes so that plans are made before they create strain on the relationship or business.</p><p> And no matter how you look at it, it&rsquo;s a relationship business; from a client, as well as business partner perspective.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 16:56:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 16:56:48.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_VjmT8zt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-happens-when-partners-no-longer-share-the-same-vision/\", \"post_id\": \"11651\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 16:56:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 16:56:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-happens-when-partners-no-longer-share-the-same-vision\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11650\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5681\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/What-Happens-When-Partners-No-Longer-Share-the-Same-Vision.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"816\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465560000,"author_id":50,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5458,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seven Reasons Your Networking is Not Working","link":"seven-reasons-your-networking-is-not-working","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When people approach me to help them find jobs, they are often frustrated that they&rsquo;ve been trying to network but it hasn&rsquo;t yielded any job leads. Typically when clients run into a networking challenge like this, it is for one of seven reasons.</p><h3> Not enough prospective employers reached</h3><p> <br/> Yes, networking takes time and energy, many times more than just simply firing off a job application. If you were looking for a job, you&rsquo;d want to apply for at least 3 jobs a week, right? Well, having 3 networking calls isn&rsquo;t the same because there is no guarantee there&rsquo;s any opportunity. In order to generate three solid job leads a week, you have to reach 15 of your professional contacts. This can be through LinkedIn, email, phone calls, or coffee. Otherwise, the numbers simply aren&rsquo;t high enough to yield strong results.</p><h3> The reason for wanting to leave current employer is not seen as valid or logical.</h3><p> <br/> Remember that someone in your network is putting their professional credibility on the line when they recommend you to a hiring manager at their company. If you got fired, say so. If you left things in a bad way at your prior job, say so. Otherwise they&rsquo;ll see you&rsquo;re lying, dismissively fib that they&rsquo;ve passed on your resume to HR, and then do nothing. Don&rsquo;t get creative, just be real with people.</p><h3> Wrong time of the year to be looking for a job.</h3><p> <br/> I tell my clients that the least opportune times are mid June through Labor Day, and then Thanksgiving to New Years. While these are great times to network face to face (holiday party, beach party) with your contacts, you&rsquo;ve got to follow up when the job market is in full swing.</p><h3> Because this is a network, some prior knowledge of the candidate is coloring the decision somehow.</h3><p> <br/> Remember when you were at that Beer Pong game in Cancun in college on spring break and you met the investment banking analyst at Credit Suisse that you are now trying to convince to recommend you for the analyst program? Enough said.</p><h3> Candidate is successful reaching his or her contact at target company but not able to get contact to refer him/her to the person who has authority or knowledge regarding the hiring process</h3><p> <br/> Your contact may overestimate their leverage within a company, may not understand how to or have the time to present you to the hiring manager correctly, or may not even know the right person to refer you to. Before you enlist your contact, take a moment to figure out how effective they really can be given their current position, even if they are 100% onboard with doing all they can.</p><h3> Something wrong with professional presentation.</h3><p> <br/> Resume, LinkedIn, FaceBook are showing something that your network doesn&rsquo;t like. It could be anything from a spelling error or grammar mistake on LinkedIn to your style of dress. Again, how you present yourself professionally is a reflection on them.</p><h3> Talking to a person unwilling to help.</h3><p> <br/> Some people are just plain altruistic and will help another person looking for a job. Maybe they&rsquo;ve been there. Other people require reciprocity and are not willing to do another person a favor in the hopes that someday it will come back to them. But don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; they&rsquo;ll put up a front that this isn&rsquo;t the case while they&rsquo;re talking to you. Nobody wants to be the wet blanket. So it&rsquo;s on you.

Or, do they think you see them as an important part of the team? Are they there to serve you? Or, are you there to serve them? Effective leaders are a benefit to their employees. This benefit is not based on the perception of the leader; it is based on the perception of the employees. So, do your employees know you are there for them or do they think they are there just for you?</p><h3> <strong>  Trust </strong></h3><p> <br/> Trust is a two-way street. It&rsquo;s not only important that your employees trust you to do what is in their best interest, but that you trust them. How does your behavior signal employees that you trust them? Leaders who trust their employees allow them to have control over their own work. They allow them to make decisions and take action without being micromanaged. When employees know that you trust them, they feel that you are there for them and they see your leadership as a benefit.</p><h3> <strong>  Investment </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you invest your time and resources in developing your employees it shows them that they are valued. We are drawn to people who want the best for us and are willing to invest their strengths in helping us achieve our goals. When you are willing to invest in your employees, helping them to become the best that they can be, you are demonstrating that you are there for them.</p><h3> <strong>  Community </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you develop a sense of community employees feel like they belong. Community brings us together and motivates us to work toward the good of the whole. When employees know they are part of a community that you have created and support they feel safe and believe that you, as a leader, are there for them.</p><h3> <strong>  Be There </strong></h3><p> <br/> To be an effective leader your employees must know that you are there for them. When they know that your leadership is beneficial it gives you the power and influence you need to be a successful leader. If your employees feel that you see them only as a tool for accomplishing your own goals, they will close themselves off from you and your attempts to influence them will be ineffective. Develop mutual trust with your employees. Invest your time and resources into their development. And, develop the sense of community where employees know they are safe and part of something bigger than themselves. Let your people know that you are there for them.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 17:25:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 17:25:43.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_VdC1xQU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-really-there-for-your-people/\", \"post_id\": \"11657\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 17:25:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 17:25:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-really-there-for-your-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11656\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5684\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-You-Really-There-for-Your-People.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"542\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465581600,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

It seems fair, reasonable and satisfying. You expect to receive what the final judgment states you are due.</p><p> Brace yourself: Chances are that the steps required to meet the terms of a divorce agreement will leave you and your ex-spouse confused, frustrated, and still adversarial.</p><p> In my experience of over 25 years as a divorce financial planner, I have found most people need help to implement their divorce order properly. The necessary logistical details are rarely spelled out in a divorce agreement, and they always place the burden of follow-through on the divorced couple.</p><p> But most ex-spouses fail to create what they need: a mutually acceptable post-divorce action plan for moving forward. Such a plan lays out step-by-step actions in order of their priority, along with a timetable for achieving them. The goal is to avoid inaction, ambiguity, noncompliance, and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;inadvertent forfeiture of entitlements.</p><p> Here are only some of the problems you might face:</p><li> Enforcing obligations to pay child support, alimony</li><li> Ensuring compliance with custody and parenting agreements</li><li> Non-payment of debts</li><li> Failure to list the family home for sale or refinance its mortgage</li><li> Improper division of assets</li><li> Failure to divide assets at all</li><li> Attorneys benefit greatly from this post-divorce angst and may even perpetuate conflict through court motions and motions for contempt.</li><p> <br/> Problems can get particularly knotty when you&rsquo;re dividing assets. Say, for example, you are dividing retirement accounts. You are ordered to divide these accounts equally and in-kind and with each ex-spouse retaining his or her own accounts as appropriate.</p><p> This sounds clear enough, but is it? What if you have a grab bag of different kinds of retirement accounts, some of them costing you money to divide and others nothing at all? Suppose you both have traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, annuities, 401(k) plans, and pensions:</p><li> Do you divide equally all types of retirement accounts?</li><li> Do you each keep whatever accounts of same character you both own, split the ones you don&rsquo;t, and perhaps transfer an equalization payment? (John and Susie, for example, each keep their traditional IRA, they divide Susie&rsquo;s Roth and John&rsquo;s 401(k), they divide John&rsquo;s annuity, and John pays Susie an equalization payment.)</li><li> Do you each retain your own accounts, whatever they are, and have one spouse make an equalization payment to the other? <br/>  </li><p> Unfortunately, disagreeing about how and when to do something is not as problematic as refusing to do it at all. Some ex-spouses simply feel settlement agreements are made to be broken and they defy your every request. The key nuance is if your ex-spouse is defying you willfully and intentionally.</p><p> If so, you have only two major options. One is to wait and hope that at some point your violating ex-spouse complies with his or her obligations. The other is to hire an attorney to enforce your former spouse&rsquo;s obligations under a property settlement agreement or previously issued court order.</p><p> Enforcement of child support orders is a special case. It comes at no cost to the spouse owed the money because of the very strong national policy to support the health, safety, and welfare of children. All states have laws that specifically address the failure to pay child support, and judges don&rsquo;t like it when parents fail to make court-ordered child support payments.</p><p> When all else fails to get a non-compliant ex-spouse to fulfill his or her obligations, filing for contempt remains your best option. It is a big deal to be held in contempt, and your ex could be held liable for both civil and criminal penalties: fines, payment of your attorney fees, or even a jail sentence. Your piece of paper, after all, is a legal order.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 17:28:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 17:28:28.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_3vOrQz0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-post-divorce-finances-are-trickier-than-you-think/\", \"post_id\": \"11659\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 17:28:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 17:28:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-post-divorce-finances-are-trickier-than-you-think\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11658\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5685\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-Post-Divorce-Finances-Are-Trickier-Than-You-Think.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"700\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465556400,"author_id":307,"chart_url":""}

If you are launching a new product or solution &ndash; with corresponding  <strong>  <a href=\"http://ext-marketing.com/marketing-articles/why-microsites-are-a-big-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   microsite  </a> </strong> , brochures,  <strong>  presentations </strong> ,  <strong>  <a href=\"http://ext-marketing.com/marketing-articles/crafting-your-email-etiquette/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   emails  </a> </strong> , etc. &ndash; remember that structure can actually help ideas flourish.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a project manager running a brainstorming session, here are a few ways to make the best ideas see the light of day.</p><h3> 1. Split up time</h3><p> <br/> Try not to schedule gruelling, three-hour meetings with a &ldquo;no one&rsquo;s leaving until we hash this out&rdquo; mentality. People will run out of steam and your team&rsquo;s ideas may stray too far, or just stop.</p><p> Try scheduling three shorter meetings instead. Thirty minutes, if run well, is a good length.</p><li> Your first meeting can act as a brief introduction that closes with some high-level idea generation. The outcome should be a few strong options for the team to reflect on after the meeting ends.</li><li> In the second 30-minute meeting, the team can generate more ideas based on the strongest options from the first meeting.</li><li> In the third meeting, the team can refine, and then choose, the best ideas to keep. <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Help people generate great ideas</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s easy to tell when you&rsquo;ve run a great brainstorming session. If the table is messy, if people are exhilarated and if the walls are filled with ideas, you&rsquo;ve done your job well. Here are a few things you can do to help make this happen:</p><li> <strong>  Inspire people </strong>  to say their wildest ideas, especially during the earlier sessions. These ideas can serve as fuel for later sessions.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t judge  </strong> anything that is said. People need to feel safe to speak up without being judged. If someone is too negative or judgmental, ask them to keep their comments positive and maybe think twice about inviting them to your next brainstorm session.</li><li> <strong>  Record everything </strong>  and keep all the ideas from your brainstorming sessions. Bring sketch pads and sticky notes, and get ready to write. To keep things moving fast, forget about spelling and neatness. <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Invite people from outside the creative team</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re looking for a truly big idea, invite people from different teams and departments. Think about bringing in someone from production, sales, research or IT. Outsiders bring fresh perspectives, so they may provide that &ldquo;something different&rdquo; you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><h3> If the table is messy, if people are exhilarated and if the walls are filled with ideas, you have done your job well.</h3>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 17:33:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 17:33:44.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_VQGWkzg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-lead-a-brainstorming-session-to-make-ideas-see-the-light-of-day/\", \"post_id\": \"11661\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 17:33:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 17:33:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-lead-a-brainstorming-session-to-make-ideas-see-the-light-of-day\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11660\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5686\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Lead-a-Brainstorming-Session-to-Make-Ideas-See-the-Light-of-Day.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"757\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465552800,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5462,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Build and Scale Your Financial Advisory Practice","link":"how-to-build-and-scale-your-financial-advisory-practice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You won't find this idea in a book, even though we are launching our book, the second edition in July 2016 of \" Guerrilla Marketing For Financial Advisors\" . You won't find this idea at a seminar, course or workshop.</p><p> Not even on line or any website. In fact you won't get this information from top financial advisor performers, but you will find the idea where you work. It will change the way you think. It will change your business strategies. It will make you take a close look at what your doing right and what you need to improve on. The idea will help you grow, develop and build your practice to heights you thought weren't possible. It will make you understand your business better, even more than hiring a consultant. It is a guerrilla marketing idea which is investing time energy and imagination into your business. This one idea may change your business in 2016 and beyond. Once you start to apply the idea over and over, you will find a steady stream of ideal clients to work with.</p><h3> If I was asked to give only one idea to build and scale a financial advisory practice, this would be the idea.</h3><p> <br/> Create a board of directors with your top clients and centers of influence. Ask them for feedback and ideas on every aspect of your business from advice to marketing, client appreciation and client communication.</p><p> Invite from six to ten of your top clients in one meeting for an hour and get valuable feedback on your image, identity, business and marketing. Then hold a second meeting for your top centers of influence or referral sources. Hold these meetings three to four times a year and buy your \"board of directors\" lunch for giving you valuable feedback on all areas of your business. It will cost you less than $200 and a few hours of your time. Each time you are creating formal feedback for your business. The most amazing thing happens when you tell people you are working on your business. Within 30 days you get referrals to more like minded people and gain additional top clients.</p><p> Each year change the board to new clients and new centers of influence to build relationships and gain insight as well as referrals from influential individuals. Just like coaching and mentoring, it is feedback from the people that use your services to tell you how you're doing. They may give you ideas that you and your success coach, manager or mentor may not see and understand. You can't get that from a book or a course.</p><p> For example, If I have never experienced being one of your clients for a period of time, how can I give you long term valuable feedback on what you are doing, how you communicate with people and how your business is perceived? It is this valuable feedback from your top clients and centers of influence that is going to give you the edge over your competitors.</p><p> A secondary objective is a way to develop referrals and clone your best clients by discussing the fact that you are looking for more clients like them to build your business. Make it clear though that this is not a referral session, but a genuine feedback session for your business. It is to ask questions like\" what are the 3 things that you value the most about our services\" ?</p><p> Some advisors have used this as a referral meeting by bringing in their top referring clients and discussing their business plans and asking who or what target market should they tackle next. The clients will tell them the clubs their associated with, hobbies and activities and where they might meet them in a casual setting to introduce their advisor to friends and associates in different groups, associations or settings. You will learn about several types of groups and associations. Others may use it as strategic networking opportunity to find out charitable events their clients are involved in and ask to join or participate.</p><p> For example if you are looking to attract dentists, have a dentist focus group or board of directors luncheon. If you have more than one market, then cluster together different types of groups and or have several referral and or focus group meetings.</p><h3> A sample agenda list <br/>  </h3><li> Client statements format/recommended changes/timeliness of information/ do you want them hole-punched/suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Client education/seminars format/topics of interest/speakers/suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Web site&ndash;Format/content/additional stuff/future use/frequency of use/ suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Client appreciation&ndash;Plans/lunches, golf days, books, gifts, spring promo (seeds and garden book?)/how to WOW clients/suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Client service&mdash;Assistants/office/telephone/greeting/appearance/perception/suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Client communications&ndash;Email communication (Is it effective, interesting, or a waste of time; what do you think of the personalized emails?)/seminar invitations/special bulletins/news articles/quarterly newsletters (quality, useful information, topics and ideas to discuss)/suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Client tax planning focus&ndash;Tax efficient and planning focus/team of experts/ resources/request for feedback/client perception.</li><li> Client building&ndash;Typical sought client/working with other professionals/suggestions for additional team members/mailer ideas/database building/referral-generation ideas/performance feedback/suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Target marketing&ndash;For example sponsorships such as lawn bowling, community events, other ideas/brochure or client intro kit.</li><li> Advertising&ndash;Newspaper articles (Do you read them: Do they appeal to you?)/weekly ads in newspaper (Continue or change?)/suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Professionalism&ndash;Interviews/feedback/knowledge, skills, commitment, etc./ suggestions for improvement.</li><li> Feedback and comments. case study <br/>  </li><h3> Case studies critical <br/>  </h3><p> Make sure you have a case study which is a description of your ideal client you are looking for. A case study will help people recognize the type of clients you work best with. Make sure you discuss your ideal client that you are looking for. Have an agenda set up for the meeting and be prepared to discuss and disclose your business ideas that you are planning to do. Depending on the group, you may also hand out a client communication plan, business plan or your marketing plans for the coming year.

{"original_id":5463,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Retirement Stress: When \"Living the Dream\" Doesn't Come Easy","link":"retirement-stress-when-living-the-dream-doesnt-come-easy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I came into financial planning in the second half of my career. It is truly a calling for me. As a  <strong>  CFP </strong> &reg; , I adhere to a code of ethics that holds competence as a core principle and requires a commitment to lifelong professional education. Because there is always more to learn and new ways to help my clients achieve their goals, I recently began coursework through the Sudden  <strong>  Money </strong>  Institute to become a  <strong>  Certified Financial Transitionist </strong> &reg; . It&rsquo;s a natural fit for me, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to say that after completing Part One of the program, I&rsquo;m already putting some of the lessons into action.</p><p> One of the topics we covered in the first session last weekend was the importance of mindset in how one defines and handles the stress that comes with every life transition. Mindsets exist at two ends of the spectrum, with a  growth mindset  at one end and a  fixed mindset  at the other. People with a growth mindset see stress as a challenge, while people with a fixed mindset see stress as a threat. Every transition comes with stress, but your mindset dictates how you respond when something you care about is at stake.</p><p> Oddly (or so I thought so at first), one of the most stressful  <strong>  transitions </strong>  I could think of with my clients is one that is viewed as a positive change: retirement. In nearly every case, approaching retirement is full of a crazy amount of stress. So much for that vision of the happy couple laughing hand in hand as they stroll on the sand! Instead, retirement often comes with a ton of uncertainty, fear, disagreement, and emotional chaos. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><p> My clients Wendy and Brian have been looking forward to retirement for years. Brian is five years older than Wendy, so he retired a few years ago. Wendy is still working at a job she loves, but Brian wants to travel, hike and fish, and do all the things he&rsquo;s afraid they&rsquo;ll soon be too old to enjoy. They agreed on a retirement date for Wendy, and with my help, they&rsquo;ve been working toward that goal. Now that date is just around the corner, and instead of feeling joyful, Wendy is completely stressed out. When she and Brian met in my office last week, I could feel the tension between them, and despite my best efforts, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to help them focus on the rational aspects of their retirement plan. Both Wendy and Brian were swimming in emotion, and their upset was palpable. When life changes,  <strong>  money </strong>  changes&mdash;and that&rsquo;s stressful.</p><p> Wendy&rsquo;s mindset about retirement was a fixed mindset. She had a negative view of stress, and every decision felt life-threatening. When I asked Wendy what she was thinking and feeling, she said, &ldquo;I realize how confused I am about what my life will look like after I leave my job. Who will I be? What can I afford? Will we have enough  <strong>  money </strong>  to live like we do now? Brian wants to travel the world, but I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s at the top of my list,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everything feels upside down. I realized I&rsquo;ve been running so hard to get to the end of work that I haven&rsquo;t been able to face what is beyond. What is retirement? There are so many things I need to understand before taking the leap!&rdquo;</p><p> Brian&rsquo;s mindset about retirement was a growth mindset. He realized all the changes he would have to address, but he was excited and challenged. Although Wendy and Brian were in sync with their goals and dreams, their different mindsets triggered very different responses to the stress that comes with the transition to retirement. Given that there are two sides to  <strong>  money </strong> &mdash;the technical and the emotional&mdash;our work together will address the emotional side first so Wendy and Brian can rise to the challenge of the next phase of life, connect with others, and learn and grow together.</p><p> If your retirement (or another life-changing event) is around the corner, here are three steps to get you started on a path toward your &ldquo;new normal&rdquo;:</p><h3> <strong>  Step 1: Examine your mindset about stress </strong></h3><p> <br/> By taking a deeper look at how stress triggers your responses, you can harness the power of stress and position yourself to learn and grow. Do you act or react to major change or loss? Are you reactive and closed off, or are you responsive and open? Acting puts you in a growth mindset, while reacting puts you in a fixed mindset. Explore ways to take control of change. Share your stories and your history so you can better understand yourself and those who share your life.</p><h3> <strong>  Step 2: Know what&rsquo;s at stake in the future </strong></h3><p> <br/> This iswhere you move towards the stress to name it, understand it, and embrace it. When life changes,  <strong>  money </strong>  changes, and this is important. At this stage, it&rsquo;s important to name your fears. Are you afraid of being a bag lady, or are you afraid of failing to live the life of your dreams? Maybe you&rsquo;ve always wanted to write a novel, but your career got in the way, and you now have the time to realize your dream. Maybe you want to see the Northern Lights or spend more time with grandchildren or take up a second career (perhaps a service-based career like the opportunities I talked about in my recent blog  <a href=\"http://www.kleinadvisors.com/resources/entry/inspirations-finding-purpose-in-your-second-half-of-life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Inspirations: Finding purpose in your second half of life </a> ). There are no rules. Take the time to explore how you want to live it so you can make it happen.</p><h3> <strong>  Step 3: Harness the power of stress </strong></h3><p> <br/> With a growth mindset and a clear idea of what is at stake&mdash;for you&mdash;you will be more open to opportunities and learning. Now you can work on the technical side of  <strong>  money </strong> ; set realistic budgets, set meaningful goals, and strive to build a community of friends and family. Remember that after 50, changes come fast and furious, so when the next change comes (and it will), you&rsquo;ll have created the capacity to be responsive rather than reactive. You&rsquo;ll get a little older; you&rsquo;ll get a little wiser, and the trade-off will be a good thing!</p><p> When I meet with Wendy and Brian meet next week, we&rsquo;ll follow these steps, taking the time to dig into each area to help them find a deeper connection, decrease stress and, most importantly, have a shared growth mindset that will serve them well through this transition and all the rest to come.</p><p> Remember: endings bring  <strong>  transitions </strong> , and every transition leads to a new normal. Fostering a growth mindset through  <strong>  transitions </strong>  will enable you to harness the creative power of stress so you can get to your &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; with as little uncertainty, fear, disagreement, and emotional chaos as possible.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 19:32:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 19:32:06.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_tQAZ4Lr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/retirement-stress-when-living-the-dream-doesnt-come-easy/\", \"post_id\": \"11665\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 19:32:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 19:32:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"retirement-stress-when-living-the-dream-doesnt-come-easy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11664\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5688\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Retirement-Stress-When-Living-the-Dream-Doesnt-Come-Easy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"774\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465567200,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5464,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Four Real Benefits of a Strong Advisor Brand","link":"the-four-real-benefits-of-a-strong-advisor-brand","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Most financial advisory firms understand the potential value of a powerful brand.  One challenge I often see though is the problem they face in understanding and positioning Brand ROI within their firms. Unfortunately, most advisory firms are focusing on filling their prospect pipeline rather than ensuring the prospects are the &ldquo;right&rdquo; ones.</p><p> <strong>  The basic and prevailing mindset around Advisor Brand ROI (LEADS </strong> <strong>  ) is that &ldquo;Number of Leads&rdquo; is the key goal. This mindset is wrong painfully wrong. </strong></p><p> Advisory firms, and many marketers unfortunately, focus on &ldquo;Number of Leads&rdquo; while &ldquo;Quality of Leads&rdquo; is an after-thought. It hits advisors once they realize their leads aren&rsquo;t good &ndash; in that they aren&rsquo;t ready to do business and don&rsquo;t reflect the type of client they&rsquo;d prefer to work with. I&rsquo;d argue that Lead Quality is much more important and much more in line with what advisors really want &ndash; better clients. Most marketing vendors aren&rsquo;t good at Lead Quality, they usually only know Lead Quantity. Your Advisor Brand ROI depends is a product of quality and quantity of leads.</p><h3> <strong>  The Real Benefits of a Strong Advisor Brand </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are essentially FOUR key benefits financial advisory firms gain from developing a compelling brand; a brand that helps them be seen as different, better, and more valuable than their competitors.</p><li> Clarity and focus breed confidence</li><li> More and better referrals</li><li> More engaging and effective marketing</li><li> More energy and momentum <br/>  </li><p> Details on these four benefits follow.</p><h3> <strong>  #1: Clarity &amp; Focus Breed Confidence </strong></h3><p> <br/> Have you ever struggled to introduce yourself to an ideal prospect or COI and feel less than confident that the way you articulate your value is compelling and intriguing enough to advance the conversation? You&rsquo;re not alone. Most people I speak with have the same challenge &ndash; lack of clarity and focus with their advisor brand and ideal audience.</p><p> A good branding process will help you overcome years of fumbling through &ldquo;who am I, how do I differ from my peers and why am I better for you&rdquo;.</p><p> When advisors are asked the right questions and put on the spot to provide out-of-the-box answers, they should easily slip into what sets them apart: how, why and for whom. It&rsquo;s really an incredible process of enlightenment and one you need to enter into sooner rather than later. If you&rsquo;re not 100% confident in your value proposition and your financial brand, you should find out what branding process and partner can do to help you figure this out. All of your marketing hinges on how compelling your message is.</p><p> If your &ldquo;why, how and for whom&rdquo; answer is something like &ldquo;I provide comprehensive financial planning for and always put my client&rsquo;s best interests first. They trust me to do what is best for them&rdquo;, then you are right in there with what 99% of all other financial advisors are saying.</p><h3> <strong>  #2: More &amp; Better Referrals/Leads </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve told this story many times and it&rsquo;s important enough that I want to share it again with a specific example.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the story:  Joe &lsquo;s clients, Mary and Bob, are ideal for his practice. They are 55 and 57 respectively, their children have started their own families and both Mary and Bob are in their high-income earning years. Their portfolio is &gt;$1MM and they have robust financial and estate plans in place. Joe would love to clone more clients like Mary and Bob. Like most advisor-client relationships, Mary and Bob have a deep personal affinity for Joe and what he does for them. Joe feels the same personal connection and commitment.</p><p> We all know Joe yearns for and needs Mary and Bob to refer him more ideal prospects. That&rsquo;s a given.</p><p> Picture this if you can. Bob is mowing his lawn. He and Mary live in an affluent neighborhood but they take pride in maintaining their own property. This is part of what makes them ideal clients in Joe&rsquo;s mind. Bob&rsquo;s neighbor Ken approaches and begins complaining about the investment market. Bob suggests Ken consider his advisor, Joe.  Ken asks what Joe is about (as a financial advisor). Bob describes Joe as trustworthy, has integrity, always picks up the phone, hard working, puts their interests first and so on. Ken nods his head as if he&rsquo;s interested but in his mind, he isn&rsquo;t. Bob just described the last two advisors Ken has worked with. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all the same&rdquo; Ken contemplates. Bob then offers to provide Ken with Joe&rsquo;s phone number when he can find his business card. Ken kindly accepts but knows he&rsquo;ll likely never contact Joe, and if he does out of respect for Joe, it won&rsquo;t be an engaged conversation; you know how those end.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how this scenario changes when a thoughtful brand message and marketing foundation are in place.</p><p> Ken, I used to worry about the market too before I met Joe, he&rsquo;s specializes in helping 50-somethings plan for financial possibilities &ndash; he has a podcast you might want to listen to called FiftyWealth&trade;. You can access his podcast, papers on financial planning when you&rsquo;re in your fifties and more on his website at FiftyWealth.com. Everything you read and experience at FiftyWealth.com is exactly what it&rsquo;s like to work with Joe &ndash; he&rsquo;s a fee-only advisor, will only start working with people when they are in their fifties and his approach gives me the peace of mind to enjoy mowing the lawn even when the market is crashing.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a monumental difference in these scenarios. A strong financial brand means more and better referrals &ndash; that&rsquo;s as powerful an ROI as there is in this business. How many &ndash; that&rsquo;s up to you and the next phase of your  <a href=\"http://kirklowe.com/advisor-marketing-blueprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Blueprint for Exceptional Financial Marketing </a> .</p><h3> <strong>  #3: More Engaging &amp; Effective Marketing </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you and your marketing team don&rsquo;t have a clear brand or message, every marketing piece is a new project. That direct mail piece: what will it be about, how will it grab someone&rsquo;s attention, and what if it doesn&rsquo;t get them to act? Is there any gain or benefit your firm can derive from them seeing your piece?</p><p> Without a strong brand, every marketing piece is an isolated one-off challenge. Each piece is more than likely disconnected from others therefore there is no continuity of message and any possible brand awareness gains are minimal or even negative in the consumers&rsquo; minds.</p><p> Branding breeds uniformity, focus and clarity not just for you, your team and your designers. Your audience loves uniformity &ndash; humans need clarity, uniformity and relevance to truly appreciate you, your brand, and your offer. In other words,  <a href=\"http://kirklowe.com/difference-branding-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <strong>   branding is marketing  </strong> </a>  and if you haven&rsquo;t formed and nurtured a concise and consistent brand, your marketing suffers tremendously.</p><p> Let me put this to you another way. For every $10,000 you spend on advertising (direct mail, seminars, ads, PR&hellip;) you waste most of it if you haven&rsquo;t first defined a compelling brand.  It&rsquo;s a painful truth, one I deal with regularly when we meet with financial firms, &ldquo;I wish we had met you 15 years ago, we&rsquo;ve wasted so much money ( add the usual expletive here ) on average marketing and we&rsquo;ve tried many ideas trying to find that elusive silver marketing bullet&rdquo;. All you need is the right approach to significantly enhance your marketing effectiveness. There&rsquo;s no magic, just a good branding and marketing strategy that gets implemented.</p><p> Imagine a direct mail post card in front of you right now; in fact grab one off your desk. Is there an intriguing message&hellip;design? Do the message and call-to-action resonate with you? Does it make you want to engage their offer or brand? If you do decide to take the next step, is the supporting marketing (likely their website or landing page) as good? Does it have the same message? Does is have design continuity? Does it look like they&rsquo;ve taken the time to impress you?  Is it easy and risk-free to get to know more about them and experience what they are capable of?</p><p> Strong and clear advisor brands are more engaging and they ultimately result in more effective marketing.</p><h3> <strong>  #4: More Energy &amp; Momentum </strong></h3><p> <br/> How many times have you and your marketing team started and stopped marketing?</p><p> When you perfect your brand, you are inspired to do great marketing. There is no magic there; it&rsquo;s easier to market your practice when you have a clear brand; when you know exactly what to say. The branding process also challenges you to develop deeper value in your business and that in turn means you have new ideas and concepts to present to your audience. When you&rsquo;re armed with a great story and concepts to back it, marketing is so much easier.</p><p> Let me revisit the example from above re FiftyWealth.com. In going through the process of defining James E Wilson&rsquo;s trademarked brand,  FiftyWealth &trade;, we created his Financial Life Timeline, a chart that depicts the life stage implications of financial planning. This chart was derived from the branding process and it simplifies his thinking and pitch so clearly it&rsquo;s easy for ideal prospects to appreciate and see applicable value. The branding process also conceived the idea of James sharing his ideas via a podcast &ndash; his FiftyWealth podcast.</p><p> Branding gives energy to your ideas and your marketing.  And, when you start implementing your brand and your ideas it creates momentum in your business. This momentum also feeds your energy and your marketing dedication grows and grows.</p><h3> A few of the benefits from more energy and momentum: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Better implementation </strong>  &ndash; implementation requires energy &ndash; you&rsquo;ll have it now</li><li> <strong>  Dedication endurance </strong>  &ndash; your dedication to marketing implementation lasts</li><li> Experience  <strong>  repeatable success </strong>  &ndash; when you see repeatable success &ndash; it&rsquo;s contagious</li><li> <strong>  Try more/do more </strong>  &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be open to exploring more effective marketing opportunities you would have turned away previously</li><li> Marketing becomes  <strong>  easy and fun </strong>  &ndash; marketing fun, get out of here!</li><li> Builds upon your  <strong>  results </strong>  foundation &ndash; when you have confidence, everything is possible &ndash; better marketing, better results</li>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 19:58:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 19:58:07.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_0G02192.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-four-real-benefits-of-a-strong-advisor-brand/\", \"post_id\": \"11667\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 19:58:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 19:58:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-four-real-benefits-of-a-strong-advisor-brand\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11666\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5689\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Four-Real-Benefits-of-a-Strong-Advisor-Brand.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"641\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465576200,"author_id":284,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5466,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Anyone Can Call Themselves a Futurist: 6 Ways to Test Yours","link":"anyone-can-call-themselves-a-futurist-6-ways-to-test-yours","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The world&rsquo;s first futurist, Marinetti, wrote the  <a href=\"http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  futurism manifesto </a>  in 1909. In it, he passionately described futurists as rebels. A lot has changed since then. In role and in numbers.</p><p> My colleagues and I sometimes joke halfheartedly: &ldquo;Everyone who can Google, can call him/herself a futurist&rdquo;. In the last decade, we have seen an incredible rise in the number of trend watchers, forecasters, foresight specialists, and futurists. Many of them lost their jobs in the recession and are now self-employed future specialists. They all share the passion, they all put in the hours but is that enough?</p><p> Yes.</p><p> And no.</p><p> As the majority futurists, I too am self-appointed. I didn&rsquo;t study future studies either. I feel the passion, put in the hours. So what&rsquo;s the difference?</p><p> Quality is the difference. Not just generic abstract quality, but verifiable features type quality. This is the list of criteria you can test your futurist with:</p><p> 1.  <strong>  Data </strong> : The easiest check you have for the quality of your futurist, is asking what data he is using. If it&rsquo;s just the blogosphere, then you know enough. A futurist can use examples from the blogosphere to illustrate scientific data. He should be able to show you his sources so you can check them if you want to. Good sources are peer-reviewed papers, conference papers, and his own university research</p><p> 2.  <strong>  Vision </strong> : futurists frequently use the same sources. One of the few differentiators is what futurists do with the information. The futures they describe must be based on several trends and vary in the trends used, their speed and direction. It&rsquo;s all about possible, probable, and wild card futures, both in the positive and in the negative</p><p> 3.  <strong>  Prediction </strong> : There is no way that a futurist can predict which trends will or won&rsquo;t make it, or what their growth rate and path will be. If he could, he would be called God, and if he just says he can, he&rsquo;s a quack. A good futurist will use a disclaimer, telling you that his futures are just a slice of all possible futures. His purpose is not to act as a fortune teller, but to help you shape your own preferable future</p><p> 4.  <strong>  Realism </strong> : Futurists must be able to explain abstract developments and scientific notions in simple and clear language. You can ask him what the relevance is of his futurism for the present, and he should not reply with the question what you think it the importance is. If he&rsquo;s worth his money, he will be able to relate an abstract concept to today&rsquo;s work processes and markets</p><p> 5.  <strong>  Awareness </strong> : I have yet to meet the client who hires a futurist just for amusement. There are better ways to spend the company money than on an expensive bit of fun. So I think I can make the statement that the presence of the futurist serves a purpose. A good futurist will ask you what that purpose is, make clear how he can help you attain that goal, and what instruments he has to measure and manage progress along the way.</p><p> 6.  <strong>  Responsibility </strong> : With knowledge comes responsibility. A good futurist will not leave a client in disarray. He has to dole out his futuristic inputs in well-timed phases and doses. You can&rsquo;t be expected to drop everything your company has achieved to run after a possible future. Your staff can&rsquo;t be forced to change into something they&rsquo;re not ready for. Your customers may not be alienated. As the saying goes: a good futurist will not undo what he can&rsquo;t reestablish. Meaning: he mustn&rsquo;t move faster than your company can manage, but he still needs to be ambitious. You can check this by discussing the impression the futurist has of the extent that your company is able to change</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-09 20:45:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-09 20:45:32.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_U3HPVfQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/anyone-can-call-themselves-a-futurist-6-ways-to-test-yours/\", \"post_id\": \"11671\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-09 20:45:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-09 20:45:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"anyone-can-call-themselves-a-futurist-6-ways-to-test-yours\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11670\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5691\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Anyone-Can-Call-Themself-a-Futurist-6-Ways-to-Test-Yours.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1140\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465574400,"author_id":52,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5468,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When We Know Our Pulse and Arrange Our Work in Harmony With It, We Become More Impactful","link":"when-we-know-our-pulse-and-arrange-our-work-in-harmony-with-it-we-become-more-impactful","source_link":null,"content":"<p> First time I had a 9-5 job, on the heels of a showbiz career that came with a more mercurial schedule, I was stumped. I wondered, how did people function between 3 and 5 in the afternoon? By mid-afternoon I was spent; I merely faked my way to the end of the day.</p><p> I have since built up stamina. But I am describing my natural daily pulse. It is likely different from your natural daily pulse. And yet, we are constantly asked to &ldquo;perform&rdquo; in ways that are not aligned with our pulse. Tony Schwartz, author of The Way We&rsquo;re Working Isn&rsquo;t Working, is an outspoken champion for the benefits of knowing and respecting our various pulses.</p><p> Some very simple pulse principles:</p><h3> <strong>  Your Daily Pulse </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are times of the day when we are more physically energized, more mentally attuned, more emotionally primed. For many folks this occurs in the early part of the day. Not for everyone.</p><p> <strong>  Tip: </strong>  If at all possible, schedule your most critical tasks during your peak-pulse-times. When I write, I tend to write in the mornings. My peak.</p><h3> <strong>  Your Weekly Pulse </strong></h3><p> <br/> Debbie Moskowitz, a researcher at McGill University, found that any given work week tends to have its own pulse. According to Moskowitz, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the days when our capacity to focus is likely at its peak.</p><p> Mondays are often warm-up days, best suited for less rigorous administrative tasks. By Thursday afternoon, our mental and physical energies may wane. Fridays, Moskowitz suggests, are best suited for open-ended work, relationship-building, long-term building. Makes sense, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> <strong>  Tip: </strong>  Consider your weekly pulse as you plan your week.</p><h3> <strong>  Your Yearly Pulse </strong></h3><p> <br/> Most of my clients work with great intensity, week after week. And then there are those weeks or months when intense becomes hyper-intense. Budget time. Sales convention time. Internal reporting time. These hyper-intense periods are cyclical AND predictable. They are part of the annual pulse of your work.</p><p> Tony Schwartz created a Survival Guide for Sony UK to help its staff better manage their energy during these annual peak times. The guiding principle: The greater the demand, the greater the need for renewal.</p><p> <strong>  Tip:  </strong> Facilitate renewal by reducing alcohol intake during evening meetings. Ritualize morning exercise. Eat more frequently and more lightly. Go to sleep at a designated hour.</p><p> Common-sense stuff. The results, according to Sony UK&rsquo;s Commercial Director, were astounding. When we know our pulse and arrange our work in harmony with it, we become more impactful. Go ahead, incorporate words like renewal, recovery, and managing energy into your daily thought process.

And right now, tax laws are looking about as permanent as they get.&rdquo;</p><p> That leads to Tax Alpha, a topic on which Frank has written numerous papers and articles. &ldquo;Determine the average amount of taxes a client would pay on their portfolio over a lifetime. And when you can reduce those taxes to enhance performance &mdash; that difference is Tax Alpha,&rdquo; Frank says. &ldquo;The more you save on taxes, the more Tax Alpha you create, the more money you can put to work for the client and their family. It adds tremendous value.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;And to generate Tax Alpha, the power of tax deferral is huge,&rdquo; says Frank. &ldquo;I like to quote Albert Einstein, who said, &lsquo;The most powerful force on earth is compound interest.&rsquo; To be more precise &mdash; tax-deferred compound interest.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  TAXES: KEY TO THE PLANNING </strong>   <strong>  EQUATION </strong></h3><p> <br/> In addition to advising clients for more than twenty years, Frank launched a master&rsquo;s program in financial planning two decades ago and continues to teach. &ldquo;I love the holistic approach to planning &mdash; there&rsquo;s a natural fit between financial planning, investment planning and tax planning. Taxes are really a common thread that goes through everything.&rdquo;</p><p> After co-launching, helping to build and then sell a successful $2 billion AUM practice, Frank joined Lexington Wealth Management as the Director of Investment Tax Strategy. &ldquo;Lexington is a very progressive firm &mdash; and my role here underscores the importance of taxes. It used to be you had to see your CPA to figure out your taxes. But at Lexington, it&rsquo;s my job to make sure taxes are a key part of the wealth management equation and the overall financial plan.&rdquo;</p><p> Lexington specializes in high income and high net worth clients, who average roughly $5 million in investable assets, while also serving some clients with $20 million or more. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the high net worth clients who often take the hardest hit from taxes,&rdquo; says Frank. &ldquo;But nearly all clients can find ways to benefit from Tax Alpha. It&rsquo;s fundamental to a comprehensive plan.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  ASSET LOCATION FOR MORE TAX ALPHA </strong></h3><p> <br/> Frank employs a five step process &mdash; financial planning, asset class selection, investment vehicle selection, asset location and rebalancing. &ldquo;Step number four &mdash; asset location &mdash; is critical yet often overlooked. I&rsquo;ve used this step throughout my career. Optimizing the location of investments represents an advisor&rsquo;s greatest opportunity to create tax alpha.&rdquo;</p><p> Research has shown that asset location can dramatically reduce taxes over time and reliably enhance overall performance by 100 bps or more - without increasing risk - as the same investment are being used, just located in the right investment vehicle.</p><p> &ldquo;Just as asset allocation enhances diversification to protect a portfolio from volatility, asset location enhances diversification from the tax perspective,&rdquo; Frank says. &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s very situational &mdash; depending on factors like the client&rsquo;s income and potential capital gains &mdash; the savings and subsequent wealth created by asset location can be substantial, especially for clients in high tax brackets and clients with a portfolio of $1 million or more.&rdquo;</p><p> Research has shown that asset location can dramatically reduce taxes over time and reliably enhance overall performance by 100 bps or more &mdash; without increasing risk &mdash; as the same investments are being used, just located in the right investment vehicle. Start by considering three factors. First, the tax-efficiency of assets &mdash; do they generate long term capital gains, short term capital gains or ordinary income? Second, the management style of assets &mdash; passive or active? Third the client profile &mdash; including age, tax bracket, liquidity needs, and estate planning needs.</p><p> Then locate assets based on tax-efficiency. Locate tax-efficient investments such as buy and hold equities, index funds, ETFs, and tax-exempt municipal bonds in the taxable account. Locate tax-inefficient investments such as fixed income, REITS, commodities, actively managed strategies and liquid alts in tax-deferred vehicles such as a 401(k), IRA, 529 Plan or other tax-deferred vehicle.</p><p> And for the high net worth, who can easily max out the low contribution limits of qualified plans, variable annuities can be a valuable solution. VAs can make sense when the amount of tax inefficient investments targeted for tax-deferred vehicles is greater than the capacity of a client&rsquo;s qualified accounts. Frank notes that another advantage of using variable annuities is the ability to defer beyond age 70 &frac12;. Unlike an IRA, VAs have no required minimum distributions.</p><p> But only the right kind of VA makes sense. &ldquo;If the cost is low enough for the math to work, then a VA can be a real win for the investor,&rdquo; said Frank. This is what drew him to Jefferson National&rsquo;s Monument Advisor, the industry&rsquo;s first flat-fee Investment Only Variable Annuity (IOVA). &ldquo;Jefferson National is truly the top of the class. It checks all the boxes. In most cases, it&rsquo;s the lowest cost. No one has more funds. No one has better tools or better service. It&rsquo;s the best way of buying tax deferral for the lowest cost and largest array of asset classes.&rdquo;</p><p> Frank cautions that to get the best value for clients, it&rsquo;s important to look closely at all of the fees, including the underlying investment options within the VA. In some cases, funds available in the VA may be more expensive than the retail equivalent mutual funds. In other cases fees may be equal to, or even less than the retail equivalent, depending on the specific fund, the fund family and the share class offered by the VA.</p><h3> <strong>  THE CLIENT CONVERSATION </strong></h3><p> <br/> When Frank sits down for the first time with a client who is not familiar with asset location, he starts with the five fundamental steps. &ldquo;We spend time educating the client so they understand each step of the whole planning process &mdash; and how asset location fits.&rdquo;</p><p> Then, to make it more concrete, he looks for an obvious deficiency. For example, a client&rsquo;s high-yield bond made 6 percent &mdash; but in their bracket, they lost 2 percent to taxes.</p><p> From there, he explains the impact of taxes over time. &ldquo;At 6 percent, the client&rsquo;s money is going to double every 12 years,&rdquo; says Frank. &ldquo;But if they lose 2 percent to taxes, then it takes 18 years to double &mdash; 50 percent longer.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Play that out over several decades &mdash; the cost of taxes versus the benefits of asset location &mdash; and it really resonates. Clients can immediately understand. And they want to know more.&rdquo; Many clients see an additional benefit. &ldquo;Asset location can create enough Tax Alpha that some clients are able to pay for our entire advisory fee every single year through the extra tax savings.&rdquo;</p><p> And how to explain the costs to a client if they don&rsquo;t use asset location? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple,&rdquo; Frank says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re either going to have to take on more risk to generate more return. Or they&rsquo;re going to end up working for more years.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a very direct relationship between paying out more in taxes each year &mdash; and earning lower returns.</p><p> &ldquo;The tax drag impacts clients on a long-term basis. But using asset location is a proven solution to increase Tax Alpha &mdash; and increase returns &mdash; without increasing risk.&rdquo; That means more wealth for your clients, even when confronting today&rsquo;s higher taxes, lower yields and ongoing volatility.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/low-cost-iovas.png\" width=\"628\"/></p><h3> ABOUT GLENN FRANK</h3><p> <br/> Glenn Frank, CPA/PFS, MS Taxation, is Director of Investment Tax Strategy at Lexington Wealth Management.

{"original_id":5470,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Reasons Your Company May Fail at Client Service","link":"five-reasons-your-company-may-fail-at-client-service","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There are a number of reasons that companies fail at customer service. As I read dozens of articles each week, numerous books on the topic throughout the year, as well as conduct some of my own research, there are some very clear reasons. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not what you are supposed to do, but what you should avoid doing. If you&rsquo;ve been following my work, some of this may seem like a review, yet we must constantly be reminded of these reasons. So while there are many, here are five common reasons that companies fail at customer service:</p><h3> <strong>  1. There&rsquo;s no clear definition of what customer service looks like in the organization.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t just say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give great customer service.&rdquo; You have to define what it is, what it looks like and what you want the customer to experience. It has to be crystal clear. I just worked with a company that created a four-word mantra, as I like to call it. A short one sentence phrase that is easily understood and remembered.  Put the customer first . But, to just say it is nothing more than lip service. This company created an entire program around those four words. Every employee is participating in training sessions and the effort will be ongoing, not for a few days or weeks, but hopefully for years to come.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Good people are in the wrong jobs. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> A  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IeLQqUs-FkA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  customer service culture </a>  starts with the people. And, there are plenty of good people out there, just some of them aren&rsquo;t suited for a truly customer-focused organization. It starts with hiring the right personalities to fit the culture. But, what about current employees? Make sure they buy into your customer service definition and are ready and willing to be a part of the initiative.</p><h3> <strong>  3. There is a lack of proper training. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/the-two-sides-of-customer-service-training-human-and-technical/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Training </a>  is not something you do one time. It&rsquo;s not something you teach during orientation and never bring up again. It&rsquo;s an ongoing effort. The best companies have ongoing reminders and trainings to keep customer service front of mind.</p><h3> <strong>  4. They treat customer service like a department.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> For a truly customer-focused culture to work, everyone has to be aware of how they impact the customer&rsquo;s experience. One of my favorite sayings has always been that customer service is not a department. It&rsquo;s a philosophy to be embraced by every employee, from the CEO to the most recently hired.</p><h3> <strong>  5. They treat employees one way and expect the employees to treat the customers a different way. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The behavior of leadership and management toward employees is incongruent with the customer service initiative. The remedy is my  Employee Golden Rule , which is to treat employees like you want the customer treated &ndash; maybe even better.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 17:14:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 17:14:20.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_KtNafLl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-reasons-your-company-may-fail-at-client-service/\", \"post_id\": \"11681\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 17:14:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 17:14:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-reasons-your-company-may-fail-at-client-service\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11680\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5696\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Five-Reasons-Your-Company-May-Fail-at-Client-Service.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"737\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465812000,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5471,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seven Ways To Fix Your Bad Money Habits","link":"seven-ways-to-fix-your-bad-money-habits","source_link":null,"content":"<p> [hab-it] :  a usual way of behaving; something that a person does often in a regular and repeated way.</p><p> Your life is filled with habits: what you eat, how and when you exercise and how you handle your financial life.</p><p> If your habits 100% support your efforts to live a healthy, productive and secure money life, then stop reading now.</p><p> But if you worry about your money, are dissatisfied with your money life or struggle to keep your spending in check, then you&rsquo;ll want to take a good hard look at your money habits.</p><p> The idea of changing your habits doesn&rsquo;t have to seem like climbing Mt. Everest naked in January.</p><p> Think of it like this: your habits come from your mindset&mdash;your beliefs about something. For example, let&rsquo;s say you believe that by exercising regularly your body becomes healthier and stronger. If you take this belief and create a set of action steps&mdash;that you repeat over and over&mdash;those actions eventually become a habit. You go from barely making it down the block to running your first marathon.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no different with your money habits. If your money life is in shambles, a quick look backward can uncover the reasons why and you can adjust your mindset to better serve you.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re ready to start shedding destructive money habits in favor of those that will bring greater security and happiness into your life, here&rsquo;s how to start.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Consider your current system for managing money. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> If it&rsquo;s not working&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to find a new system.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Think incrementally. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> Just like beginning an exercise or weight loss program, results are unlikely to be measurable immediately. Focus on the knowledge that making small changes will lead to meaningful results.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Your mindset determines your success. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> If you believe you can make changes and continuously apply your incremental tactics to your mindset, you are moving in the right direction.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Keep it simple. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> You do not need to hire a Big 4 accounting firm to oversee your process. Make a small shift such as setting a savings goal&mdash;and then make that your first allocation from your income instead of waiting until you see how much is left after you&rsquo;ve paid all your bills.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Acknowledge that willpower is not a constant companion. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> Just as there are times of the day when you feel stronger or fresher to make decisions, so it is with your willpower. Avoid making financial decisions during the periods when your willpower is not in full force.</p><h3> <strong>  6. New habits do not take hold overnight. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> The research indicates that it can take three weeks to eight months to build a new habit, with an average of 66 days. You&rsquo;ve got to give those new habits a chance to stick.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Use your motivation to keep you on target.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Write down your reasons for making a change and keep them close. Read them seven or eight times a day to remind yourself why it&rsquo;s so important to develop your new habit. If your goal is to get out of debt, then consider how wonderful it will feel to have zero balances, no harassing phone calls and no huge interest charges.

Just watch for the swarm of journalists following her every step.</p><p> Since taking over for Ben Bernanke in 2014 as the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Yellen has become perhaps the most visible person in finance. She has captivated audiences with her economic commentary and regularly speaks to millions that hang on her every word after Federal Open Market Committee meetings throughout the year.</p><p> Not only does Yellen function as the ultimate monetary policy decision maker, she also holds the very important position of head spokesperson responsible for communicating Fed decisions and future expectations to the financial media and investing public.</p><p> Given the significance and complexity of the Fed&rsquo;s messaging, this is no small task. These decisions impact economies across the world, and one slip of the tongue can lead to mass confusion and subsequent market chaos. Yellen must also constantly be on her toes as reporters incessantly shower her with leading questions about the direction of interest rates. Should she make a statement too dovish or hawkish, the soundbite could lead to unintended consequences across the entire financial system. The mere phrasing of her sentences can create or destroy billions of dollars of wealth.</p><p> The World Affairs Council hosted the Fed Chair in Center City Philadelphia last week, in what would be her final speech before the Fed&rsquo;s quiet period leading up to next week&rsquo;s meeting. Given the event was right in our backyard,  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gregory FCA </a>  was in attendance to see firsthand how Yellen delivers her messages while handling the intense and relentless spotlight.</p><p> After watching Yellen give her speech and take questions (including one about Donald Trump potentially crashing the financial system), we identified three lessons from her approach that can help financial services companies across the U.S. hone their own messaging strategies.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Know your audience </strong></h3><p> <br/> Shying away from complex financial terminology is not in Yellen&rsquo;s repertoire when delivering speeches or explaining monetary policy. She does this to accurately and clearly articulate her point, but also because she knows her audience possesses a similarly sophisticated economic intellect.</p><p> Financial services firms must apply the same concept to their own messaging. When speaking to the media, cater your language to the intended audience to ensure your words resonate and stick in their mind. Tone down the financial jargon when jawing with a local newspaper reporter. But when a Bloomberg senior analyst calls, demonstrate your expertise with specific, high-level commentary.</p><h3> <strong>  2. It&rsquo;s about more than just   what   you say </strong></h3><p> <br/> Yellen utilizes a steady, monochromatic tone of voice when interacting with the media because she understands the intense scrutiny given to her every word. Should she overemphasize her position on a certain economic indicator or statistic, it could lead to a media frenzy focused around a (perhaps misguided) extrapolation of what the perceived emphasis could mean.</p><p> While lesser known financial executives aren&rsquo;t held to the same level of scrutiny, it&rsquo;s important to understand your words carry weight. A bold emphasis on a certain topic can be interpreted in a litany of ways. Financial services professionals without proper media training can unintentionally sway from their intended messaging points simply because they haven&rsquo;t practiced their delivery. It&rsquo;s best to nail down a specific strategy beforehand. How you say it  is equally as important as  what you say.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Under promise, then over service </strong></h3><p> <br/> Despite the Fed&rsquo;s massive influence, macroeconomic conditions are in a constant state of flux. Because of this, the Fed follows the tried and true tactic of under promising and over delivering, and never makes explicit predictions about the future. Financial services professionals, especially financial planners, should follow the same model in their own communications by outlining realistic expectations for their customers and clients.</p><p> These lessons are a good place to start, but a solid messaging platform takes time and training to develop. Never overlook your marketing or messaging efforts. Setting a solid foundation and following time-tested strategies will ultimately dictate your success.</p><p> For more lessons learned from the Fed, check out  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/industry-trends/the-fascination-with-the-fed-and-what-it-should-tell-you-about-your-financial-services-pr-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  our post about leveraging the FOMC calendar to get face time with the media </a> .</p><p> This post is a collaboration between Ben and another member of the  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gregory FCA </a>  team, Freddy Martino. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 17:29:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 17:29:07.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_EnbhT1L.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-power-of-messaging-what-we-can-learn-from-janet-yellen-and-the-fed/\", \"post_id\": \"11685\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 17:29:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 17:29:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-power-of-messaging-what-we-can-learn-from-janet-yellen-and-the-fed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11684\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5698\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Power-of-Messaging-What-We-Can-Learn-From-Janet-Yellen-and-the-Fed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"763\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465819200,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5473,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Leaders Impact Profits","link":"how-leaders-impact-profits","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The tagline for Progressive Leadership Group is &ldquo;cultivating leaders, growing profits&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s a pretty bold statement, I know.  Is there really a through-line that shows the bottom line impact of leadership?  My answer is a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the main areas where leadership impacts the growth (or decrease) of your profits.</p><h3> <strong>  Turnover </strong></h3><p> <br/> Employees join companies, but they leave managers.  Some of the main reasons they leave: they feel undervalued; the job doesn&rsquo;t use their skills; no communication; no growth opportunities; no feedback; lack of relationship with their manager.  Salary and benefits come in way down the list, so why do managers always try to pay people more when they submit their resignation?  It&rsquo;s the easy way out, because it takes the focus off of the manager&rsquo;s inadequacies.</p><p> Recent surveys show how turnover impacts profit.  For entry-level jobs, paying under $30k, the replacement cost is 16% of annual salary.  Positions paying under $50k, cost 20% of annual salary to replace.  Management up to senior management positions can cost 100% to 200% of annual pay to replace.   If you&rsquo;re up to it, take out a calculator, or better yet, have your CFO estimate how much turnover cost your company last year.</p><h3> <strong>  Disengagement </strong></h3><p> <br/> The latest Gallup survey shows that 7 out of 10 employees are disengaged.  This should be the first thing a CEO works to improve if they hope to grow and remain profitable.   When employees are engaged they care about the company, are willing to work harder, and believe that their work makes a difference. Disengaged employees are not productive.  They are present, but they don&rsquo;t contribute to the achievement of the department or the company&rsquo;s goals.  If they are actively disengaged they are causing harm by spreading negativity and sabotaging the efforts of co-workers.   Engagement has a bottom line impact.  Work units scoring in the top 25% had significantly higher productivity, profitability and customer ratings.  Organizations with a higher percentage of engagement had 147% higher earnings per share as compared to their competitors.  Gallup estimates that disengagement costs the U.S. somewhere between $450 billion and $550 billion per year.  I realize that&rsquo;s a wide range, but even at the lowest figure, that&rsquo;s a lot of profit and productivity out the window!</p><p> Managers can increase engagement by:  focusing on employee&rsquo;s strengths; giving them a vision and mission to work toward; building relationships;  and investing in their growth.  Leaders have the responsibility to create the conditions for employee engagement &ndash; it is not an HR initiative.</p><h3> <strong>  Healthcare Costs </strong></h3><p> <br/> Bad managers make employees sick.  It&rsquo;s not easy to hear, but it&rsquo;s the truth.  The work environment is one of a few key factors that affect an employees&rsquo; health.  When employees feel undervalued, or they don&rsquo;t understand how to perform to the manager&rsquo;s expectations, it has a real effect on their physical and mental health.   The company is impacted by higher healthcare costs and lost productivity, due to increased absenteeism and leaves of absence.</p><p> A leader must understand how to engage employees, motivate them, and create an environment where they feel a valued part of the work unit.  By leading in this way, you will reduce absenteeism and increase productivity.</p><p> If leaders reduce turnover, increase engagement, and create a healthier workplace environment, profits will increase.  Good leadership is good for the bottom line.</p><p> Let us know your thoughts.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 20:15:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 20:15:03.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_q0N1jus.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-leaders-impact-profits/\", \"post_id\": \"11687\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 20:15:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 20:15:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-leaders-impact-profits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11686\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5699\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-Leaders-Impact-Profits.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"633\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465826400,"author_id":136,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5474,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Activities With the Greatest Return on Marketing Investment","link":"5-activities-with-the-greatest-return-on-marketing-investment","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HingeMarketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  John Tyreman </a></p><p> Here at Hinge, we&rsquo;ve studied over 11,000 professional services firms and their clients. Most recently, we published our first annual  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/2016-high-growth-research-report-released1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  High Growth Study </a>  of 526 professional services firms. A comparison of high-growth firms (at least 20% growth year over year) to other firms highlighted several best practices and techniques your B2B firm may want to adopt.</p><p> In an earlier post, I went into detail about the  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/tying-analytics-to-growth-5-marketing-metrics-every-b2b-firm-should-track\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  five B2B marketing metrics every firm should track </a> . This post addresses the five marketing techniques that provide the greatest return on a firm&rsquo;s marketing investment. But first, let me bring you up to speed on how we made the calculation.</p><h3> The Return on Marketing Investment Calculation</h3><p> <br/> There is no such thing as &ldquo;free&rdquo; marketing. Like any other facet of a business, marketing requires an investment. But investment in marketing can often times be hard to quantify in dollars or percentage of revenue. Time spent on marketing activities is easily lost in the ledger. <br/> <br/> Taking both time and money into account, Hinge quantified marketing investment on a 0&ndash;10 scale. We also used the same scale to measure the effect of each technique. We calculated return on marketing investment as the difference between the impact received and the effort invested ( Impact &ndash; Effort ).</p><h3> Top 5 High-Return Techniques</h3><p> <br/> The five techniques with the highest return on marketing investment are not necessarily the easiest, nor do they have the greatest impact on a firm. Rather, they are the techniques that produce the greatest return for the level of effort they require.</p><h3> <strong>  1) Speaking engagements.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Speaking engagements require a significant level of effort. The hours traveling to an event and preparing to speak aren&rsquo;t billable, and securing a speaking slot is often a pay-to-play deal. The effect, however, makes this marketing technique worth the investment.</p><p> According to our research, we found speaking engagements to have the greatest average impact among all marketing techniques used by professional services firms. They present a great opportunity to grow your network, demonstrate your expertise, and employ other <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/high-growth-marketing-techniques-for-your-next-speaking-engagement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  traditional marketing techniques. </a></p><h3> <strong>  2) Webinars.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> As the digital equivalent of speaking engagements, it&rsquo;s no surprise  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/super-tools-for-your-content-marketing-plan-video-and-webinars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  webinars </a> made this list. Although they require minimal effort, webinars had the highest return on marketing investment among all digital techniques.</p><p> Webinars can be broadcasted from your office or even your own home, giving you added flexibility. Integrating a webinar with social media can also encourage audience participation, building visibility and reputation simultaneously. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3) Guest blogging.  </strong></p><p> <br/> Guest blogging has become a widely accepted best practice for increasing both the visibility and expertise of professional service providers. The level of effort required for guest blogging is similar to writing for your firm&rsquo;s blog, but yields greater benefits and can be easily  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/6-steps-to-incorporate-guest-blogging-as-part-of-your-overall-content-strat/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  incorporated into your overall content marketing strategy. </a></p><p> There are two benefits that separate guest blogging from blogging on your firm&rsquo;s website: a) You get in front of a new audience and b) you build relevant links to improve search engine optimization (SEO). These additional benefits are what pushed guest blogging onto the list of marketing techniques with the highest return on marketing investment.</p><h3> <strong>  4) Direct mail.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> When was the last time you picked up a pen and wrote a letter to your clients or prospects? If you can&rsquo;t remember, you may want to consider doing so. Handwritten letters coupled with marketing collateral can be a great way to show a personal touch to your prospects and clients, and requires minimal additional cost. (As of April,  <a href=\"http://www.stamps.com/usps/postage-rate-increase/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the cost of US postage for first class letters decreased from $0.49 to $0.47. </a> )</p><p> This direct approach was also a traditional marketing technique frequently employed by high-growth firms. Requiring minimal effort, a physical piece of mail can stand out from a cluttered email inbox.</p><h3> <strong>  5) Online advertising.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Over the course of the past few years, discerning between organic search results and paid advertisements could be difficult. Recently, Google placed an &ldquo;Ad&rdquo; disclaimer on paid search results.</p><p> Even though a web-searcher can clearly see a result is an ad, paid results still appear at the top of a search inquiry. It&rsquo;s been observed that users are more likely to click a link on the first page than to venture deeper into the search results. According to HubSpot,  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/14416/100-Awesome-Marketing-Stats-Charts-Graphs-Data.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  75% of users never scroll past the first page of search results </a> .</p><p> While it can quickly become a costly investment, a highly targeted PPC campaign can produce qualified web traffic when implemented correctly.</p><h3>  </h3>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 20:22:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 20:22:21.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_dqWR9pa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-activities-with-the-greatest-return-on-marketing-investment/\", \"post_id\": \"11689\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 20:22:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 20:22:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-activities-with-the-greatest-return-on-marketing-investment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11688\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5700\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-Activities-With-the-Greatest-Return-on-Marketing-Investment.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"846\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465812000,"author_id":300,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;m always striving to become the best version of me that I can be. Sometimes I fail miserably and other times, I make great leaps of transformation.</h3><p> <br/> In the past, my efforts have consistently been  self-improvement projects  &ndash; during which I tried with all my might to change myself to meet others&rsquo; needs or expectations. My focus was on fixing my inadequacies. I thought I had to change who I was or how I behaved to please other people (so that I&rsquo;d be accepted and liked). I would always fail miserably at these efforts because I would set a goal for the change without being clear on  why  I was making the change. I would create a self-development checklist of all the &ldquo;actions&rdquo; I needed to take and I&rsquo;d attack the project with great vigor - at first. When I acted in a way that was opposite of the change I was trying to make, I&rsquo;d beat myself up. I&rsquo;d expect quick results; so when the quick fixes  didn&rsquo;t work , I&rsquo;d scrap the whole project. <br/> <br/> No matter how much we want to make a change in our attitude, our behavior, or our ways of thinking, the process is still difficult. We easily get stuck in our old habits, swirl in our fear-based beliefs, and get trapped in our outdated (and often inaccurate) patterns of thinking. When we&rsquo;re stuck here, we can&rsquo;t see or understand why the change isn&rsquo;t happening. We want the change, we want to become a better person, but we critically judge and berate ourselves for not being able to make the shift. Or we excuse or rationalize it away &ndash; telling ourselves we&rsquo;re just wired this way so why bother trying to change? <br/> <br/> I&rsquo;ve come to see that personal growth, at its core, is not about fixing our inadequacies. True personal growth, real transformation, is about slowly uncovering and evolving into the person that we already are &ndash; at the deepest level of our soul. Personal transformation is about letting go of the false parts of ourselves that no longer fit: the masks we wear to try to please or fit in with others, the self-protective behaviors we&rsquo;ve been learning our whole life, and the traits we lean on when we feel like it&rsquo;s not enough to just be  who we are . <br/> <br/> Real transformation is less about striving to become someone we think we&rsquo;re supposed to be and more about relaxing away and releasing the parts of us that no longer fit so that our true selves can emerge. This process takes time; we&rsquo;ve been building our personas for our whole lives so expecting them to change overnight is not realistic. <br/> <br/> There are three things I&rsquo;ve learned to be true about personal growth:</p><li> <strong>  When it comes to personal transformation, there are no quick fixes, no overnight successes, and no immediate gratification. </strong> We can&rsquo;t just wish our way into a change or snap our fingers and instantly become the person we aspire to be. True transformation takes time. It  requires slow, deep, patient work .  We need to offer ourselves grace and forgiveness when we revert back to old ways (which we will do, see the next point&hellip;).</li><li> <strong>  Even though we long to become a better person,   we will resist the very change we are seeking  . </strong> We will sabotage our own success, and we won&rsquo;t always notice that we&rsquo;re doing it. We are creatures of habit and we find comfort in our comfortable ways of being &ndash; even when our behaviors, beliefs, or choices are bringing us or others pain or misery. We&rsquo;re more comfortable hanging out there because it&rsquo;s what we know. It takes more effort for us to change than to continue doing what we know.</li><li> <strong>  Another big disappointment is that there are no one-size-fits-all checklists, approaches, or winning formulas for personal transformation. </strong>  This is important because we see other people having great success and naturally we want to know what we&rsquo;re doing. When we try to replicate their process, we fail.  We need to realize that what works for other people may not lead to the same outcome for us. We&rsquo;re starting from a different place, we have a unique personality and we may be trying to fill different needs. We need to honor our uniqueness and individuality.</li><p> <br/> When we keep these three truths in mind, it creates an environment that supports transformation. We view the whole process more realistically and we find comfort in knowing that we get more than one shot at it. Personal transformation is not often something than happens in a few months; it can take a lifetime to evolve into the person we were created to be. Personal transformation is rarely about learning new behaviors. It involves unlearning  our old ways of being,  letting go  of our fear-based beliefs, and  relaxing  old habits and patterns. <br/> <br/> Transformation is a process, and as life happens there are ups and downs. It&rsquo;s a journey of discovery &ndash; there are moments on mountaintops and moments in deep valleys of despair.  (Rick Warren) <br/> <br/> When you find yourself in the valleys of despair, remember to give yourself grace and forgiveness. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for not being able to make an immediate change. And when you find yourself on a mountaintop, remember to acknowledge your effort, and to celebrate!</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 20:37:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 20:37:05.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_6FEwMFB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-three-truths-about-personal-growth/\", \"post_id\": \"11691\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 20:37:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 20:37:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-three-truths-about-personal-growth\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11690\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5701\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Three-Truths-About-Personal-Growth.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"633\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465844400,"author_id":468,"chart_url":""}

Another topic that we have written on is the issue with trying to &ldquo;time&rdquo; the market. What people often don&rsquo;t realize is that these two concepts have more in common than you might think.</p><p> For over two decades, financial research firm Dalbar has been analyzing investor returns. It recently published its 22 nd  annual  <a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/ProductsServices/DALBARPresentsQAIB/tabid/357/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior </a>  study that compared these investor equity fund returns versus the market benchmark. The results showed significant underperformance from investors.  <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/04/26/832952/0/en/Better-Investment-Recommendations-equals-Greater-Returns-DALBAR-Annual-Report-of-Investor-Returns-Says-Not-So.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dalbar points out </a>  that &ldquo;for the 30 years ended Dec. 31, 2015, the S&amp;P 500 index produced an annual return of 10.35%, while the average equity mutual fund investor earned only 3.66%. The gap of 6.69 percentage points represents the diminished returns.&rdquo;</p><h3> So why is this the case?</h3><p> <br/> As advisors, we have long preached the  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  importance of cost </a>  and the large effects it can have on returns. While cost is a factor in investor underperformance, there are other factors that play even a larger role. The study showed that the biggest contributing factor to equity investors&rsquo; underperformance over the past 20 years is voluntary investor behavior. What does that mean? Let&rsquo;s look at a couple of examples of investor behavior that contributes to underperformance.</p><p> <strong>  1. Panic selling:  </strong> The No. 1 rule in a market collapse is not to panic. Markets can be erratic with times of larger-than-normal volatility. Responding emotionally is never a good idea. Start by understanding what your risk tolerance is. At that point, make sure you understand your investments and what their purpose is in your portfolio. Finally, look at your portfolio as a whole and make sure it is aligned properly with your risk tolerance and goals.</p><p> <strong>  2. Trend chasing/herd mentality/FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): </strong>  As the phrase goes: what you see is what you believe. When investors see a stock continue to go up, or everyone around them is talking about buying that stock, it is easy to follow the crowd and jump in without thinking. History has shown us that past performance is no guarantee of future returns.</p><p> <strong>  3. Overconfidence:  </strong> Many investors feel they perform better than what is actually happening or real. This can cause investors to believe they can accurately time the markets.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/investment-path.png\" width=\"603\"/></p><p> Telling investors about these issues is one thing. Actually seeing the fixes put into practice is another challenge. The key point to remember is that we are often our own worst enemies when it comes to managing our own investments. Having a great financial and investment plan is irrelevant if you don&rsquo;t have the mindset to follow through and stick to it. Becoming self-aware of these issues is a great first step.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 20:45:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 20:45:33.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_raG9RlS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy/\", \"post_id\": \"11696\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 20:45:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 20:45:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-investors-can-be-their-own-worst-enemy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11694\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5703\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-Investors-Can-Be-Their-Own-Worst-Enemy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"677\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465833600,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

This is you in a world where you&rsquo;re constantly proving yourself. There&rsquo;s tremendous competition.

You need to get people to follow your call-to-action.</p><p> Chances are you&rsquo;re not blowing them away with your communication skills. If you&rsquo;ve been reading my blog you know that only very recently have the situations we&rsquo;ve been confronted with been much more anxiety ridden than any time in our history. By far.

How many times have you walked away from a situation and realized that you were well-equipped to deal with it but for some reason it didn&rsquo;t come out right? There&rsquo;s no surprise there. Our brains go into a version of &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; when we get nervous. Being interviewed on a podcast. Interviewing others on a podcast. Going on a job interview or giving a presentation.</p><h3> How to Sound Amazing</h3><p> <br/> Just know that you can sound amazing.  <strong>  It&rsquo;s much easier than you think. </strong>   It&rsquo;s super easy, actually. The problem is most people think speaking better is going to be hard &amp; they put a lot of effort into it. The truth is you must do the exact opposite!

Using choppy speech with too many popped consonants! Solution:  Divide your speech into breath groups&ndash;or units of meaning and glue all of the sounds together without the awful chop!</p><p> Use a  <strong>  varied intonation pattern </strong> . Choose the words that are most important for your listener to hear and make them longer in duration and louder in volume. Take the other words, the &ldquo;grammar glue&rdquo; and make them shorter &amp; quieter. Grammar glue are your articles (the, a), prepositions, pronouns, etc. Use contractions whenever possible. I know it&rsquo;s counter-intuitive. Just do it.</p><p> <strong>  Practice the easy stuff first </strong> . You can&rsquo;t obtain new skills &amp; then apply them to all areas of your life at once. Pick your battles &amp; improve them first. Once you master the easy levels you have a rung on your ladder on which to stand. Then it makes it easier to master the not-so easy speaking situations.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 21:16:19.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 21:16:19.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_IL4MINy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-sound-amazing-in-a-brave-new-world/\", \"post_id\": \"11700\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 21:16:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 21:16:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-sound-amazing-in-a-brave-new-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11699\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5705\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Sound-Amazing-in-a-Brave-New-World.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"739\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465840800,"author_id":202,"chart_url":""}

Many of these journalists were respected senior names including  Australian Financial Review  economics editor Alan Mitchell, international editor Tony Walker, cartoonist Rod Clement and property editor and associate editor of the paper Robert Harley.</p><p> At the  Sydney Morning Herald,  investigative journalist Michael West tweeted that his \"skill sets were not aligned\" to Fairfax's new business model.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"119\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/skills.png\" width=\"457\"/></p><p> Likewise over at News Corp in November last year, 55  journalists lost their jobs. </p><p> It&rsquo;s not just print that&rsquo;s feeling the squeeze. SBS and ABC have also been subject to  <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/11/24/cost-of-the-cuts-what-the-abc-and-sbs-are-losing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  cutbacks, program cuts and staff losses </a> , dating back to 2014.</p><p> Traditional TV news audiences are declining at the same rate as print according to a study by the  <a href=\"http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/innovate-or-risk-irrelevance-new-report-warns-tv-news-providers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Reuters Institute </a> . With generations growing up with streaming services like Netflix, public interest in traditional, linear, broadcast news is shrinking. Media is now consumed on-demand and in sound bites.</p><p> This year has also been earmarked by  <a href=\"http://digitalnewsreport.org/publications/2016/predictions-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Reuters </a>  as a breakthrough year for &ldquo;robo-journalism&rdquo; &ndash;  leading to strikes in newsrooms over job losses. With news stories being written by robots, and foreign correspondents and international bureaus being replaced by newswires and syndicated content, the traditional PR pitch won't be all that effective  #understatement .</p><p> So with that as the new landscape you, as a financial services PR or marketing pro, need to understand how  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/why-pr-for-financial-services-is-alive-and-well/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  PR is changing </a>  in 2016, or risk having your message disappear faster than a  Game of Thrones  lead character. </p><h3> <strong>  1) A successful pitch had to be well-crafted and targeted </strong></h3><p> <br/> The media relations basics that PR folk relied on, and which were the standard when I started in PR nearly a decade ago, still apply today (and likely always will). Getting coverage for your story relies upon a strong knowledge of journalists and their interests. If a journalist trusts your spokesperson as a reliable contact, they&rsquo;ll call upon them when they seek market commentary. Harried journalists will appreciate relevence, helpfulness and timeliness. \"Help me to help you\" has never been truer.    </p><h3> <strong>  2) Your pitch has to be bullet proof, and there are no second chances </strong></h3><p> <br/> This year, there are rumours that Fairfax is considering shifting its newsroom to a national model. This means that, for example,  The Age  and the  Sydney Morning Herald  could be edited by the same person. With fewer journos, there are fewer names on your media lists and those that remain are stretched thinner than Ramsay Bolton's sanity.  </p><p> So the outlook for your financial services communication strategy sees a landscape where news is managed from a centralised head office covering several states, yet where global news comes from outlets like the Washington Post  or  The Times.  The scope for a story that fits the agenda of your limited local media contacts is looking pretty narrow.</p><h3> <strong>  3) Your audience isn't always getting their information from your CEO </strong></h3><p> <br/> Communications methodologies are also changing with the digital revolution. In the traditional PR model, you could choose your spokesperson (usually your CEO and other execs). Today any employee can communicate (broadcast) and has access to resources that will enable them to disseminate their message, whether or not your company approves. Employees&rsquo; personal social channels such as Facebook and potentially Twitter are open to public scrutiny that could reflect back on your organisation, and customer views are also easily shared online.</p><p> On the flip side, if there are staff within your organisation identified as influencers, their profiles can be used to gain traction for your content. These influencers can be a great asset in maximising your reach. </p><p> So it&rsquo;s not all bad news. Digital disruption has created new opportunities for your financial services <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/the-new-pr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  communications strategy </a> .   </p><p> There is a plethora of new sites being created by various influencers, many of them experienced journalists embarking on new ventures in digital publishing outside of the traditional media companies.</p><p> Thought leadership will remain in demand, and perhaps become even more highly valued as the appetite for content grows while resources shrink.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-12 21:29:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-12 21:29:44.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ZgmwyJ0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-services-pr-in-the-new-world-order-and-why-you-need-to-care/\", \"post_id\": \"11703\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-12 21:29:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-12 21:29:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-services-pr-in-the-new-world-order-and-why-you-need-to-care\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11701\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5706\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Financial-Services-PR-in-the-New-World-Order-and-Why-You-Need-to-Care.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"498\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465846200,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

But it&rsquo;s hard. Not all questions have the same impact. And it&rsquo;s risky. You never know what the response will be&ndash;which means you need to stay fully present to be helpful.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;When you ask a question you&rsquo;re giving up some of your power. It means you&rsquo;re willing to sit in that discomfort for the good of another person&rsquo;s growth.&rdquo; </strong>  -Michael Bungay Stanier</p><p> In my continued quest to surround myself and learn from others aligned with the Winning Well philosophy, I had an opportunity to interview Michale Bungay Stanier, author of The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More, &amp; Change the Way You Lead Forever.</p><h3> <strong>  3 QUESTIONS THAT WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER LEADER </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. &ldquo;WHAT&rsquo;S ON YOUR MIND?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever noticed that&rsquo;s the prompt that Facebook asks as the invitation to post? It&rsquo;s so simple. Asking &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; And then staying quiet and really listening to the answer can be a tremendous gift. Michael shares: &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s open, it invites people to get to the heart of the matter and share what&rsquo;s really important to them. You&rsquo;re not telling or guiding them. You&rsquo;re showing them the trust and granting them the autonomy to make the choice for themselves.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. AWE &ndash; &ldquo;AND WHAT ELSE?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Michael shared that in many circumstances the easy-follow-up, &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; can open the door to deeper conversation. &ldquo;There are three reasons it has the impact it does: more options can lead to better decisions; you rein yourself in; and you buy yourself time. &rdquo; It helps you to stay curious and not jump right into offering advice. The deeper understanding you have of the situation, the more you can discuss viable options.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s play this out.</p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;My boss is such a jerk, he keeps freaking out.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Oh, that sounds just terrible. That must be really hard.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;And what else is going on?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s extra mad this week because I screwed up the spreadsheet.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Oh boy, what happened there? (a slightly different version of &lsquo;and what else&rsquo;).&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know how to do pivot tables.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not really comfortable with all the formulas.&rdquo;</p><p> And BINGO&hellip; you&rsquo;re down to a solvable problem</p><h3> 3. THE FOUNDATION QUESTION&ndash; WHAT DO YOU WANT?</h3><p> <br/> I must say this is my favorite question in his book. Michael shares:</p><p> &ldquo;I sometimes call it the Goldfish Question because it often elicits that response: slightly bugged eyes, and a mouth opening and closing with no sound coming out. Here&rsquo;s why the question is so difficult to answer. We often don&rsquo;t know what we actually want. Even if there&rsquo;s a first fast answer, the question, &lsquo;But what do you really want?&rsquo; will often stop people in their tracks.&rdquo;</p><p> Being able to know what we want, articulate it respectfully, and then be willing to accept an answer&ndash; know that sometimes it will be &ldquo;no&ndash;is a vital component for having healthy conversation and productive relationships. As a leader, being able to help others identify what they want is a good place to start.</p><p> You can learn more about The Coaching Habit and download some additional free tools at  <a href=\"http://www.boxofcrayons.biz/the-coaching-habit-book/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  thecoachinghabit.com </a> .</p><p> Your turn.

Share Them. Become Your Business.","link":"advisors-have-opinions-share-them-become-your-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Forming and then delivering an opinion is what professional advisers do for a living. With every client and every engagement opinions are created and expressed.  Virtually every incoming phone call and email that arrives from clients demands another opinion.</p><h3> We aren&rsquo;t short of having opinions are we?</h3><p> <br/> Why then do professional advisers veer away from expressing them in print?  Or on video?  Or on podcasts?  Surely blogs are heaven sent opportunities for advisers to deliver opinions en masse?</p><p> But in the main advisers are poor at taking advantage of the content circulation opportunity&hellip;.and the fabulous opportunity to build a strong personal brand as a professional is wasted. Instead, we see bland content continually being delivered newsletters which expresses somebody else&rsquo;s opinion.  Not surprisingly that &ldquo;someone else&rdquo; builds a reputation and awareness in the clients minds which surpasses the advisers.</p><p> So this is for those advisers who are yet to put their voices out into the public domain, and showcase their professional competence and thinking.</p><p> Taking a stand or expressing a perspective or delivering an insight demonstrates leadership capabilities.  Not just thought leadership &ndash; which is excellent for building a great personal brand &ndash; but it shows actual people leadership.  Expressing opinions shows a way forward and demonstrates your concern for the interests of others.  It is in many respects a selfless act, although there is personal gain in building a strong personal reputation too.</p><p> Make no mistake that while I am a massive fan of the need to curate great content and share differing thoughts and perspectives with clients, and am not suggesting that advisers cease doing that, the bottom line is your clients want to hear what you think.    They want your opinions and thoughts.   Equally, other prospects who are like your clients and have similar issues and aspirations are interested in the opinions and thoughts of people like you.</p><p> For any adviser wanting to get noticed and get more business should consider getting active with delivering their professional opinions.  I have watched advisers in recent years ceased being personal client advisers as they have become so good at creating and delivering opinion, and shaping public thinking, that their business has become essentially one of publishing opinion instead of being personal advisers.  They are proof that if you want to get noticed and build your professional standing and business opportunities then you should state your opinions.</p><h3> Have opinions.  Share them.

Add to this the fact that a good deal of these firms are owned by principals who are in their 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, have no real succession plans in place, and are working harder and longer than they want to. And with little to no EBITDA to buy, there are not likely to be many interested acquirers.</p><p> So what are these business owners to do when they are at this juncture? They&rsquo;ve sunk their life&rsquo;s work into building an enterprise, only to find that it lacks the perceived value one would consider a requirement for potential buyers. Yet continuing to stay the course is simply not a good plan for them or their businesses.</p><h3> The Alternate Route: A Road Less Traveled <br/>  </h3><p> We read almost daily about the rise in M&amp;A activity in the RIA space and of private equity firms buying stakes in independent businesses. Like the $35mm investment in Ron Carson&rsquo;s Group by Long Ridge Equity Partners. Or other recent high-profile deals such as Bronfman E.L. Rothschild&rsquo;s acquisition of $1.4B Highline Wealth Management, or the partnership between $3.1B Kovitz Investment Group and Focus Financial Partners. The common ground they share: The selling firm had a good amount of free cash flow to sell, thus making them an attractive acquisition target.</p><p> But, what of &ldquo;Jordan&rsquo;s&rdquo; firm: A $350mm fee-only RIA generating $2.5mm in annual revenue, and employing a staff of 12? Unlike RIAs that utilize third-party managers, Jordan serves as CIO and Portfolio Manager and relies heavily on his 7-person research team&mdash;and they are expensive. So, if we were judging Jordan&rsquo;s business based solely on his revenue and assets, we would be impressed. But, unfortunately, his expenses are quite high, and it leaves an EBITDA of less than $100,000&mdash;far from enough to get a buyer excited.</p><p> Jordan is 56 years old and tired&mdash;worn out, in fact. He regularly works 10&ndash;12 hour days (and most weekends), his staff is good (but not great), and he hasn&rsquo;t had the time to play golf or get to the gym in months (more likely years). He recognizes that this lifestyle is neither desirable nor sustainable, and he is ready to do something about it. Jordan would love to find a like-minded RIA firm that would have interest in joining forces, providing him with a succession plan, capacity, bench strength, much needed scale, and a liquidity event. He isn&rsquo;t ready to exit the business &ndash; in fact, he wants to work at least another 7 or 8 years &ndash; but running an unprofitable enterprise is just not tenable.</p><p> The majority of firms that we approached on Jordan&rsquo;s behalf were intrigued at first by his reputation, investment management acumen, and assets under management. But once they learned of his nominal EBITDA, they all backed away. There is, however, one highly profitable $5B firm that has been a keen interest in Jordan&rsquo;s business (and our collective fingers are crossed that a deal will be consummated).</p><p> Why would a profitable, multi-billion dollar firm be interested in acquiring an unprofitable business, you might ask? The answer is simple: Because Jordan&rsquo;s business under this megafirm's umbrella could actually become profitable. He would leverage this larger firm&rsquo;s infrastructure, thus allowing him to reduce his staff considerably. He would gain scale, better pricing, and grow unencumbered. Plus, Jordan serves an interesting client niche (one that the larger RIA finds quite appealing), he brings along investment management expertise that they could definitely use, and his location would open a new market for them.</p><p> BUT&hellip;the deal only works if Jordan is willing to be very reasonable about how the acquisition of his business would be structured. After all, he doesn&rsquo;t have much leverage.</p><p> What Jordan needs to live with to make this deal work:</p><li> Because there is little EBITDA to monetize, there will be almost no cash up front in the deal</li><li> The overall valuation of his firm will be lower than industry standards for a profitable firm of his size</li><li> He will be required to jettison some of his staff to reduce expenses <br/>  </li><p> So, this deal has a greater chance of getting done IF Jordan believes (like the acquiring firm) that, in the long run, the acquisition would mean:</p><li> A long-term financial upside in the form of earn-outs and equity in a combined and more valuable entity</li><li> The ability to work more efficiently by offloading the minutia of running the business that bogs him down</li><li> An opportunity to free himself and find more work-life balance</li><li> Improvements in client service</li><li> The establishment of a succession plan</li><li> Greatly enhanced growth opportunities <br/>  </li><p> Ultimately, what Jordan &ndash; and other principals of RIAs like his &ndash; needs to consider is that continuing to operate as he is now is not viable. And while every business owner sees monetary value in what they have built, the reality is that sometimes it is not as much as they want or hope for. But by looking at the big picture (as opposed to only the short-term economics), and placing real value on solving the issues that are negatively impacting his quality of life, this path provides an easier and more enjoyable way forward.</p><p> The bright light at the end is that the selling firm&rsquo;s talent, experience and capability have the potential of thriving once again when combined with the scale and strength of the acquirer. And although it may not have the headline cache today, it will likely provide a great case study and blueprint for others down the road.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 15:04:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 15:04:27.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_wSV7mZj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/unprofitable-rias-how-to-close-deals-in-the-mergers-acquisitions-market/\", \"post_id\": \"11709\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 15:04:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 15:04:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"unprofitable-rias-how-to-close-deals-in-the-mergers-acquisitions-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11708\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5709\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unprofitable-RIAs-How-to-Close-Deals-in-the-Mergers-Acquisitions-Market.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"612\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465898400,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

We believe such fear is largely unfounded, especially for long-term investors. Nevertheless, understanding how ETF liquidity is determined and how it can affect trading practice is important for investors looking to maximize returns. Assessing the liquidity of a particular ETF requires a good understanding of how ETF trading works and how to achieve &ldquo;best execution&rdquo; when trading ETFs.</p><p> First, it&rsquo;s critical to understand that ETFs trade quite differently than stocks and other investments. The reason is that the intrinsic value of an ETF reflects the value of its underlying securities. Further, ETFs actually have three sources of liquidity, and each can affect trading strategy for a specific ETF, depending on market conditions.</p><h3> Level One <br/>  </h3><p> Level One is the secondary market. ETFs trade continuously throughout the day just like single stocks, but their price only moves as much as that of the securities in its portfolio or &ldquo;basket,&rdquo; as published each day by the ETF sponsor. Unlike stocks, however, the number of ETF shares outstanding may rise or decline, because of a unique creation and redemption process. This allows an ETF to trade significantly more shares than the exchange average daily volume statistics reveal. Therefore, trading volume alone does not equal liquidity.</p><p> <strong>  Trading Tip:  </strong> If you determine that there are enough shares of a specific ETF available for purchase or sale, you may enter a limit order to ensure a specific price.</p><h3> Level Two <br/>  </h3><p> Level Two is the range of ETF Market Depth, which relies on market makers for indications of ETF liquidity. ETF quotes from market makers often have higher ask and lower bid prices than those shown on National Best Bid Offer.</p><h3> Level Three <br/>  </h3><p> Level Three is the primary market for ETFs, which emerges through the creation and redemption process. In a creation transaction, an authorized participant (AP) &ndash; a market maker or a large trading firm that handles all aspects of client activity itself &ndash; assembles a portfolio that comprises the ETF unit.</p><p> Typically, the portfolio involves 50,000 or 100,000 shares as determined by the ETF sponsor. The AP then turns the basket, which is a defined group of securities, over to an ETF distributor and a custodian who in turn provides shares of the ETF to the AP at the net asset value (NAV). The NAV of an ETF is reached by deducting the fund's liabilities from the market value of all of its shares and then dividing by the number of issued shares. In a redemption transaction, the process works in reverse. This process facilitates a pricing discipline for any ETF, helping to ensure that an ETF&rsquo;s market price doesn&rsquo;t shift far from the value of the underlying securities.</p><p> Being mindful of ETF liquidity and trading practices may help you better maximize opportunities and optimize trades at the best possible price in order to gain potentially higher total returns.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 15:19:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 15:19:41.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_BQLcyiD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-assess-an-etfs-3-liquidity-sources-that-affect-trading-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"11711\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 15:19:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 15:19:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-assess-an-etfs-3-liquidity-sources-that-affect-trading-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11710\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5710\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Assess-an-ETFs-3-Liquidity-Sources-That-Affect-Trading-Strategy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1566\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465902000,"author_id":443,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5485,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want to Add More Value? Don't Expect Your Client to Tell You How","link":"want-to-add-more-value-dont-expect-your-client-to-tell-you-how","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s dangerous to generalize about what clients want, because clients are like snowflakes: Each client is unique and must be approached that way. However, it&rsquo;s safe to say that the biggest trend in client relationships is the drive for more value. Clients want to see more value in their relationships with a broad array of external advisors and service providers. They are being pushed to offer more value&mdash;to do more for less&mdash;by their investors and their customers. And that translates into wanting more from you.</p><h3> This topic is so important I want to give you a quick summary of the key value concepts and value-adding strategies you need to have in your arsenal. But first: Why not just ask your clients, <i>  &ldquo;How can we add more value in our relationship with you?&rdquo; </i></h3><p> <br/> The problem with this question is that clients cannot actually give you a meaningful answer to it. They usually respond in one of three ways: One: &ldquo;Uh, things are going OK. Just keep up the good work&rdquo;; Two: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mess this up, it&rsquo;s a very important project for me&rdquo;; or Three: You get a blank stare. To understand why, think about how you talk to teenagers and how you understand what&rsquo;s really going on with them. If you&rsquo;ve raised a teenager you&rsquo;ll immediately see my point. If you say to an unhappy-looking teenager, &ldquo;So, how&rsquo;s it going? How are you?&rdquo; They will get tight-lipped and say something like, &ldquo;Just fine.&rdquo; If you push harder, they will push back&mdash;&ldquo;Stop bugging me! I&rsquo;m just fine! Why are you always asking me how I am?&rdquo;&mdash;or they will go silent on you and walk away, sullenly mumbling something incoherent under their breath. (Full disclosure: My wife and I raised three teenagers).</p><p> The way you get under the skin of a teenager is to hang out with them. You go to a soccer game with them and sit in the bleachers for two hours. You drive them across town to an appointment. You take them to breakfast (but not before 11 am) at their favorite restaurant. Slowly but surely, they will open up a little bit and start to talk to you about what&rsquo;s really going on in their lives and how they are really feeling. But if you try to force them open, like a clam they will shut tight.</p><p> Clients are like teenagers in this respect. Clients cannot articulate how you can add more value because they cannot draw a straight line between their issues, frustrations, fears, and needs and your service offerings. YOU have to do that, once you have understood those issues and frustrations. And you understand them by hanging out with them. By getting them out of the office. By walking in their shoes. Then and only then can you really understand how to add more value</p><p> The really great rainmakers are visionaries. They don&rsquo;t ask their clients what they can do for them&mdash;they listen hard to understand their client&rsquo;s goals, and then they offer a bold vision that exceeds anything the client has conceived. They are masters of the art of the possible, not order-takers. Steve Jobs scorned market research&mdash;he knew that consumers could not possibly imagine the iPod or iPhone. Neither can your clients imagine their iPod or iPhone, whatever it is for their particular situation.</p><p> Here is a brief reprise of my key value concepts and strategies:</p><h3> 1.  <b>  Define value uniquely for each client. </b>  </h3><p> <br/> Yes, all clients want to grow revenue and increase profits. But the specifics are different for different clients. Each will value slightly different things in your proposal.</p><h3> 2.  <b>  Emphasize elements of your proposal and approach that will increase the perception of value.  </b></h3><p> <br/> Emphasize degree of difficulty. Link the proposal clearly to your client&rsquo;s most important objectives. Quantify the value to be delivered. Link results to revenue and profit growth. Show how hiring you reduces risk.</p><h3> 3. <b>   Add core, surprise and personal value. </b>  </h3><p> <br/> Core value is what the client contracts for. Surprise value is represented by the unexpected ways in which you add value&mdash;recommendations for solutions to fix other problems, etc. Personal value is when you provide career advice, make a valuable introduction to the client, recommend the best doctor, etc.</p><h3> 4.  <b>  Add tangible and intangible value.  </b></h3><p> <br/> Clients usually hire you because they seek institutional, tangible value: Cost reduction, resolution of litigation, completion of a merger, etc. But often, the most enduring value they perceive AFTER the fact is intangible. One CEO told me, &ldquo;My consultants did a great job on the cost reduction work. But they also helped my direct reports become better leaders. That was really valuable to me.&rdquo; Intangible value could be better decision making, improved morale, better relationships, etc.</p><h3> 5.  <b>  Spent more informal time with clients to better understand how you can add more value. </b>  </h3><p> <br/> Have a cup of coffee. Get them out of the office. Walk the halls. Ask them lots of thought-provoking questions (&ldquo;What are most excited about in the business right now? Most concerned about?&rdquo;). Create an offsite event.</p><h3> 6.  <b>  Communicate and reinforce value added. </b>  </h3><p> <br/> TELL them how much value you&rsquo;ve added. Remind them, a few times a year, about all the ways you&rsquo;ve helped their organization. If you don&rsquo;t do this, who will? Your competitors?</p><h3> 7.  <b>  Finally: Be bold and stretch your client. </b>  </h3><p> <br/> Propose ways of achieving their goals that they have not considered or are too conservative to embrace naturally. You won&rsquo;t win over everyone, but every so often you&rsquo;ll hit a home run with the bases loaded.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 15:39:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 15:39:36.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_l8WMOfl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-to-add-more-value-dont-expect-your-client-to-tell-you-how/\", \"post_id\": \"11713\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 15:39:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 15:39:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-to-add-more-value-dont-expect-your-client-to-tell-you-how\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11712\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5711\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Want-to-Add-More-Value-Dont-Expect-Your-Client-to-Tell-You-How.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"640\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465923600,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

And guess what? So is your financial advisor! But, if you take time to invest in knowing your financial behavioral biases you can work very effectively with them, instead of blindly against them</p><p> Understanding behavioral finance and the effects of human behavior on financial markets provides insight into the human side of financial decision making. This insight can help investors take a more rational and less emotional view and remain committed to long-term strategies and goals during periods of market volatility.</p><p> Both investors and advisors often make incorrect judgments based on personal beliefs, past experiences, personal preferences, and emotions. These biases direct them away from rational, long-term thinking. Further, biases focus the investor or financial advisor on only one aspect of what could be a complex financial decision-making process.</p><p> Ariel Cecchi &ndash; Consultant on Behavioural Economics and Service Design University of Geneva observes the following:</p><p> \"A common interpretation in behavioral finance is that rationality is the result of a pure cognitive process which can be behaviorally biased. In general, the bias has a negative connotation because it produces a distortion in the calculation of an outcome. When a decision-making process is cognitively biased the outcome leads to sub-optimal results or judgment errors. Roughly speaking, the subject might make irrational choices due to faulty reasoning, statistical errors, lack of information, memory errors, and the like. Differently, when the decision is emotionally biased, it means that the cognitive process has been influenced by feelings, affects, moods, and so on (let&rsquo;s label these states &ldquo;emotions&rdquo;). This leads us to irrational decisions or actions.\"</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/What-Investment-ResultsDepend-On.jpg\" width=\"569\"/></p><p> Biases are influential underpinnings in terms of the decisions we make. Such behavioral biases cannot be completely eliminated, but recognizing them is the first step in managing them, reducing their effects and avoiding self-destructive behavior.</p><p> In increasing numbers financial advisors are adopting the behavioral components of investing. They may have worked with their investors for long periods of time, focusing predominantly on risk tolerance and objectives. Not so now. Advisors are making the effort to understand why investors often react in the moment and revert to short-sighted beliefs that may hurt their returns.</p><p> Many advisors are implementing behavioral insight processes that deliver greater self-awareness for recognizing potential advisor AND investor behavioral tendencies. Tools such as ones provided by Financial DNA measure each of these behavioral biases independently and display them on a Behavioral Management Guide. This enables financial advisors to discuss the strongest biases with the client and develop a strategy for managing them.</p><p> Managing money is too important to be driven by our emotions. Running to our inherent go to&rsquo; behavior when markets fluctuate has to be managed. The responsible first step in any investor/advisory relationship, therefore, is to objectively uncover the financial personalities of both advisor AND investor, using a measurably reliable, independently validated discovery process. Anything less degrades the advisor&rsquo;s fiduciary responsibility and investor experience while opening the door for compliance issues and loss of clients.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 15:39:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 15:39:39.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_GHLcxU1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/shocking-news-for-investors-you-and-your-financial-advisor-are-biased/\", \"post_id\": \"11716\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 15:39:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 15:39:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"shocking-news-for-investors-you-and-your-financial-advisor-are-biased\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11714\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5712\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Shocking-News-for-Investors-You-and-Your-Financial-Advisor-Are-Biased.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1037\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465891200,"author_id":88,"chart_url":""}

Yup.</p><p> A couple years ago, I wrote a popular post titled 18 Reasons to Map Customer Journeys.

{"original_id":5488,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: Clients Want Outcomes, Not Deliverables","link":"advisors-clients-want-outcomes-not-deliverables","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you want a  <a href=\"http://get.clientdriven.solutions/10-steps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  powerful value proposition </a> , talk about what your client wants to do, accomplish, or become. Describe a future state of being  <a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the client desires </a> . This attraction is one of the reasons some advisors are drawn to the expression &ldquo;we help our clients achieve peace of mind.&rdquo; The client wants to see themselves in a position of not having to worry about their finances.</p><p> But many of the advisors we meet have a value proposition that is more about what they do rather than the outcome the client experiences. What you can do for a client is not what they are after. What you can do for a client is a means to an end. It is a way of getting the client to where they want to be. The value proposition is much stronger when it provides a vision of that destination.</p><p> A strong value proposition is not only critical for getting people interested in hearing about what you can do for them. It is also key for attracting  <strong>  referrals </strong> . If your clients describe what you do for them to their friends, it probably sounds a lot like what every other advisor does for clients. However, if you can teach your clients the language of what you help them accomplish, they may  <a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  repeat some of that to their friends </a>  who are attracted to accomplishing the same things. That&rsquo;s a much stronger referral.</p><h3> It is a little bit of a paradox but when someone asks you what you do (assuming you might like to have a conversation with them about becoming a client) rather than respond with what you do, tell them where you can help them go.</h3><p> <br/> You might be tempted to say you provide comprehensive planning. Or personalized guidance. Or wealth management services. You know that services like these can help the client get where they want to go but they may not be able to make the connection between the service and the destination. They may not know what wealth management is. They may not understand what goes into a comprehensive plan or how it can help them. What they know is that they want to get somewhere specific or they want a solution to a problem. You need to provide them some context. Help them connect the dots. Let them know that you can help them accomplish what they are looking for and then you&rsquo;re in a position to explain what role your service plays in taking them there.</p><p> An even weaker way to introduce yourself is to describe what you are. I am a financial advisor. I am a wealth manager. Once again, most of the time we would need to help client make the necessary connections so that they can translate the engagement of someone like you with what they want to accomplish. Some professions can get away with just using the label and have it communicate everything they needed to. If someone has chest pain or passes out in a public place we know we want a doctor. We know enough about what a doctor does to know that when someone has a health crisis that&rsquo;s the label we look for. Of course, there are many kinds of doctor and we may not even realize that the label may be insufficient. Funny story &ndash; I used to be a paramedic and would occasionally work auto races as a hobby. One night, working a 24 hour rally, I spent several hours in the back of an emergency vehicle with the race physician. At one point, to make conversation, I asked &ldquo;what specialty are you?&rdquo; anticipating emergency physician, orthopedist, or even internal medicine. &ldquo;I am a pathologist&rdquo; he replied. Someone who pretty much never treated living patients was probably not what the race organizers had in mind, but the MD after his name got him the job.</p><p> Financial advisors do not have the benefit of those kinds of assumptions. And so you need to help prospective clients understand the specific kind of future you can help them create to capture their interest and open the door to a longer conversation.</p><p> Your value proposition is not  <a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  your deliverables </a> . A comprehensive plan, a customized portfolio analysis, a retirement roadmap, and a personalized wealth management strategy are not what the client is looking for. They are tools you may use to help a client get where they want to go. When a couple visits a custom homebuilder they do not talk about hammers, saws, or even blueprints. They talk about the lifestyle that a unique home can provide them. Assuming they come to an agreement, there will be points during the relationship where they will review blueprints and renderings of the house they will build. But what they talk about upfront, what will attract those homebuyers to the builder, what will enable the company to persuade the customers to commit hundreds of thousands of dollars, is the experience of living in a particular environment they find appealing.</p><h3> What kinds of outcomes can you help clients achieve?</h3><p> <br/> They can be in the state of having made the right decisions</p><li> They can achieve some sort of freedom</li><li> They can be in retirement having made the right choices</li><li> They can maximize the special opportunities available to them (teachers, business owners, government workers, etc.)</li><li> They can be in an amazing retirement</li><li> They can be in a position to transition their business</li><li> They can have their assets protected against risks or outside interests <br/>  </li><p> If you need to update your value proposition here are a few questions you can ask that will lead you in the right direction.</p><li> How will working with you change the client&rsquo;s life?</li><li> How will they be different because they worked with you?</li><li> What is the object of the advice you provide?

Isn&rsquo;t this just the process of taking a junior employee to lunch, impressing them with my knowledge and skill and then inviting them to call me if they have a question? Perhaps that was the process 10 years ago, but today&rsquo;s employee plans on being engaged and in charge of their own career path.</p><h3> Not the same ole&rsquo; process</h3><p> The workforce today understands the power of a good mentoring partnership, but they are also looking for an engaged mentor who will provide them institutional knowledge, hands-on experiences and a glimpse, not just behind the door into &ldquo;upper-level management meetings&rdquo; but also in day to day meetings and visits with clients to better understand how strategies are discussed and decisions made.</p><p> They don&rsquo;t need or expect to have a voice in the room, but they appreciate the learning opportunity of being a &ldquo;fly on the wall&rdquo;.</p><p> This is powerful stuff! It is what connects an employee to an organization and keeps them coming back year after year. Engagement levels soar when an employee truly feels that they are part of the solution and not just occupying a desk.</p><p> And, as tenured mentors retire for an organization, the institutional knowledge they pass along to the next generation of employees and managers through the formalized mentor process is invaluable to the sustainability of the organization&rsquo;s culture.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s about the mentee</h3><p> A great mentoring relationship begins when a prospective mentee is given the opportunity to define the skill sets they would like to improve/enhance or build upon.</p><p> Gone are the days where a manager might say, &ldquo;I know what you need&rdquo; or &ldquo;this will be good for you&rdquo;. If you are interviewing and hiring the right talent, then get out of their way and let them decide what will be most beneficial in their development; this is an important ingredient for great mentoring.</p><p> Once the mentee has defined what they require around skill set development, then it&rsquo;s the employers&rsquo; responsibility to find the right mentor to provide the insight that will be beneficial to the mentee.</p><p> Mentees should then set at least three goals for themselves while participating in a formalized mentor program; ideally, the goals should be outside their assigned production goals. The formal mentoring process will support the organizations&rsquo; production goals by producing a more connected, knowledgeable and engaged employee.</p><h3> Defining Success</h3><p> Most mentor programs struggle with a myriad of ways to measure success; the metrics can become so complex that the participants become bogged down in the measurement process and lose their focus on the mentoring relationship.</p><p> A few key metrics (the fewer, the better) defined by the organization are all that are needed. And when the formal mentorship process has concluded, how the mentor and mentee feel about the results of the engagement is the true definition of success.</p><p> If there are 30 participants in a formal mentor program, there will be 30 ways of defining success.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 16:03:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 16:03:26.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_r45SSkf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/employee-mentoring-throw-out-the-process-from-10-years-ago-for-this-fresh-perspective/\", \"post_id\": \"11722\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 16:03:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 16:03:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"employee-mentoring-throw-out-the-process-from-10-years-ago-for-this-fresh-perspective\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11721\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5715\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Employee-Mentoring-Throw-out-the-Process-from-10-Years-Ago-for-This-Fresh-Perspective.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"736\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465927200,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5490,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Select the Right Custodian for Your RIA Firm","link":"how-to-select-the-right-custodian-for-your-ria-firm","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RIA in a Box </a></p><p> In general, most new registered investment adviser (RIA) firms will need to select a custodian. The custodian is the institution that will custody or maintain the firm's client assets and securities holdings. Under the  <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/275.206(4)-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  custody rule of the Investment Adviser Act of 1940 </a> , investment advisers must generally use a &ldquo;qualified custodian&rdquo; or otherwise be  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-sec-custody-rule-2064-2-independent-third-party-audit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  subject to additional regulatory compliance requirements </a> . Traditional investment advisory firms providing portfolio management services will often utilize the custody services provided by banks or broker-dealers that specialize in supporting investment advisers. The custodian selection process is a key step in  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-start-an-ria-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  starting an RIA firm </a>  as the custodian will become a vital business partner and may directly interact with the RIA firm's clients as well.</p><p> A  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearingcorporation.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  clearing firm </a>  acting as a custodian for an RIA will generally hold client assets, process securities transactions, deduct advisory fees, and compile and deliver client account statements. When evaluating potential custodian options, the principal(s) of an advisory firm should consider the following: </p><h3> <strong>  Service </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the primary motivations of operating as an independent advisory firm is the ability to serve clients in a highly customized manner. Much like many investment advisory firms view their high level of service as a differentiator, RIA firms should also carefully review the service aspects of potential custodians. The advisory firm should inquire about who they will be working with, which could be a particular person or a team. During the normal course of business, advisory firms will need to open accounts, reconcile trades, and transfer money to clients in urgent situations. Be sure to question how these types of interactions are handled from a service standpoint.</p><h3> <strong>  Investment Platform </strong></h3><p> <br/> Investment advisers utilize different strategies and allocation models and will need access to different markets and securities to manage their clients' investments. A custodian will provide an investment manager access to an array of investment products including equities, bonds, exchange traded funds, options and other derivatives. For firms implementing an asset allocation or diversification strategy, a custodian can provide access to a wide array of fund families and numerous mutual fund offerings. Firms not specializing in money management can utilize  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/what-percentage-of-ria-firms-outsource-client-portfolio-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  third party institutional money managers </a>  through the separate managed account platforms offered by custodians. In addition, some clearing firms may provide access to a range of alternative investment products.</p><h3> <strong>  Technology </strong></h3><p> <br/> In today&rsquo;s financial services marketplace, there is an ever increasing need and reliance on technology. The plethora of  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/download-the-2015-ria-technology-landscape-infographic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  technology options available to advisory firms </a>  today is leveling the playing field and allowing for independent advisory firms to compete with much larger financial institutions that often use outdated systems. RIA firms often need to manage client accounts,  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/a-guide-to-ria-crm-software-for-investment-adviser-firms-of-all-sizes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  communicate with clients </a> ,  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/proper-client-fee-billing-is-an-ria-compliance-regulatory-focus-area\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  properly  </a> <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/proper-client-fee-billing-is-an-ria-compliance-regulatory-focus-area\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  bill and invoic </a> <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/proper-client-fee-billing-is-an-ria-compliance-regulatory-focus-area\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  e accounts </a> , provide  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/a-guide-to-portfolio-management-and-reporting-software-for-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  performance reporting </a> , and  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/a-guide-to-financial-planning-software-for-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  build financial plans </a>  while simultaneously managing a myriad of other processes.</p><p> A custodian may often offer in-house technology or access to 3rd party providers. An RIA firm should evaluate the technology options within the particular platform they will utilize and evaluate any particular support available in selecting and properly integrating systems. In addition, the advisory firm should review its internal systems to ensure that their clearing firm can support such systems. Frequently, investment advisers underestimate the time it takes to properly select and integrate the right systems for their particular firm. </p><h3> <strong>  Value Added Business Support </strong></h3><p> <br/> Custodians have a thorough understanding of different types of advisory practices and the challenges that a firm can have in growing and operating their practice. In addition to hosting events, a custody firm may offer guidance on essential business goal planning, strategies to obtaining new clients, access to  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-firms-that-adopted-technology-grew-aum-faster-in-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  studies on best practices </a> , and <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-select-the-right-technology-for-your-new-ria-firm-step-1-of-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  guidance on the proper investment adviser technology to select </a> . By taking advantage of such value added areas of expertise, an adviser can build a more efficient and scalable practice. </p><h3> <strong>  Fit and Focus </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are many different advisory firms, and not all RIA custodians are the right fit for every type of practice. In addition, some traditional investment adviser custodians have minimum asset requirements for new firms. These minimums can range from $0 to over $100 million in  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-calculate-investment-adviser-regulatory-assets-under-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  assets under management (AUM) </a> . Thus, while some custodians may be very willing to support smaller, emerging firms, other custodians focus on firms with well established financial practices already operating in the  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/should-i-join-an-independent-bd-ria-or-start-my-own-ria-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  independent broker dealer (IBD) or wirehouse channels </a>  that are looking to transition to the independent RIA model. Thus, an investment advisory firm should define or categorize the type of firm they are and look to align with a clearing firm that best caters to them.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 16:04:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 16:04:54.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_dnKD39u.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-select-the-right-custodian-for-your-ria-firm/\", \"post_id\": \"11724\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 16:04:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 16:04:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-select-the-right-custodian-for-your-ria-firm\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11723\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5716\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Select-the-Right-Custodian-for-Your-RIA-Firm.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1137\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465894800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5492,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"I Am a Banker – Therefore I Lie","link":"i-am-a-banker-therefore-i-lie","source_link":null,"content":"<p> While I came up with the Emotional Banking concept a few years ago, it&rsquo;s only been a year now that I&rsquo;ve waved my banking-change crusader flag and inflicted my indignation of banks not caring about their customers&rsquo; feelings, full time. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in this past year.</p><p> I have learned in utter consternation that banks have no interest in being a serious brand like every other consumer business does. I&rsquo;ve then learned why this is and dissected its utter perceived lack of imperative that comes from a lack of mobility that no other industry has the luxury to experience.</p><p> Next up I questioned how banks can be neigh but blind to the imminent changes in the industry &ndash; the peer-2-peer plays, the internet players, the experience layers (neo banks), the technology giants dabbling with financial services and the new challengers. How they justified being able to afford more of the lack of care to the way their clients really felt about their money.</p><p> &ldquo;I lie to myself all the time. But I never believe me&rdquo; &ndash; S.E. Hinton</p><p> It turns out their blinds are handed out as soon as they become decision makers in banking. If life were a science-fiction work by Philip K Dick there would be a higher evil mastermind that keeps bank&rsquo;s boardrooms topped up with pre-Y generation males and then ensures they speak McKinsey talk in lieu of real English while loosely discussing hip FinTech words they once read in the Guardian for all of 2 minutes before returning to P&amp;L and share prices.</p><p> This would help this evil mastermind ensure there&rsquo;s no regard for the consumer, no insight into his or her needs and desires and surely no understanding of how to get, motivate and keep the right people who can put that new fangled technology to good use.</p><h3> Sadly this is not a novel but our reality.</h3><p> <br/> More worryingly, in the past few months I&rsquo;ve witnessed the famed challenger banks, a wave of new and promising structures that Britain bet its farms on, start down that path as well. Business models that were courageous and disruptive iterated again and again to at most, tamer, pale versions of their initial selves, or worse, a completely different animal that amounts to more vivid colours on a version of the high streets current accounts. I&rsquo;m sure if they cared to admit this is the case, they would blame it on the FCA license grilling but I believe it&rsquo;s simply normal start-up pressure to demonstrate model which in their case means go to market half cooked an half stripped of dreams.</p><p> Maybe there is still time for the UK challenger banks to turn the boat around and do what&rsquo;s right for the consumer but they need to stop crowd-funding till they break servers and charming conferences and journalists for vanity and put their heads down and give us insight and action.</p><p> Insight is all but absent in the industry. We never learn anything new. The same dusty statistical tidbits about amounts of tooth brushes versus mobile phones in the world and the length of marriage versus banking relationships are repeated over and over again. And it isn&rsquo;t only the establishment that is guilty of it. Of the former (as undoubtedly they are even more today) 27 founders and CEOs of challenger banks the FCA has reviewed and that I&rsquo;ve heard speaking in public or private contexts, do you know how many have had any revelation to share about consumers? If not &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the holy grail of savings&rdquo; at least a &ldquo;We saw huge anxiety when they tap in the overdraft so we change the colour of the app and the language to reassure&rdquo;. You guessed it. Not one.</p><p> The incumbents blame the immutable inertia created by tens of years of patched, spaghetti-like backend systems, for their paralysis in real interest of what would truly make consumer&rsquo;s lives better from the money point of view. If only they started all over, they say. The challengers don&rsquo;t blame anything as they won&rsquo;t admit it, but suffer from the same unwillingness because of natural constraints of being at the beginning and having to start proving their case. If only they had systems and mass, they think.</p><p> Meanwhile, the protagonist of the consumer centric mantra falls in between and gets what is, for all our FinTech sins, a flat design version of their online banking of 3-4 years ago topped off with an ever growing dread of customer support and mistrust in its uptime and an ever more futuristic in design cow-webbed branch.</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t&rsquo; just the banks (big or small) either. We&rsquo;re all guilty of it in the industry. We write articles, go to industry events and pat ourselves on the back for beginning to understand AI and Blockchain but we allow basic customer research to not happen anymore. We say it politely when we should allow ourselves to be alarmed and shake every banker we ever meet into action. We hear no revelations about consumer behavior about their money but we accept that what they really want is a new currency in identity and disruptive data and trust models. We have no serious interest in how to modify virtuous monetary behavior but we wave the &ldquo;millennials want instant access to information&rdquo; flag as if we came up with that nugget ourselves.</p><p> We lie. There&rsquo;s no point in sugar coating it. When we collectively claim all we care about is the consumer and we will put them at the center of our every thought, but we banish design to a de-facto after-thought to prettify existent cumbersome products, we lie. When we say we&rsquo;re building disruptive new models that will integrate money into larger digital contexts, but we don&rsquo;t have the backend technology to even begin to understand the data, we lie. When we know as a consumer, as a human, that our needs are nowhere close to met in our interaction with our money holder, but we spend no time seriously studying those needs and feelings but say we do, we lie.</p><p> I fundamentally believe bankers old and new are not comfortable with this particular lie (research clearly shows they are ok with other kinds) and given the means would like to change it so let&rsquo;s start with an honest look.</p><p> Where is experience design in your organisation? How many of the products and features you offer have been designed as compared to copied and modified?</p><p> How many people and how much time is devoted on good old fashioned customer research? Not the odd focus group to prove the choice of green on the left corner of the mobile app is correct but honest, intense research about their attitudes, emotions and views about money and the interaction with their provider.</p><p> How many innovation labs, funds, in- and ac-celerators have you poured (granted, non-significant) amounts of money into over the last 5 years? What can you point to that has trickled down to the consumer? How has it changed their financial lives?</p><p> Saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about the people&rdquo; sets you aside from the old and dusty ones who won&rsquo;t even admit that but is that rhetoric confined to water coolers and hip events or brought into the board room and made a priority? How many of you reward knowledge if you happen to accidentally have FinTech industry voices with strong opinions and a name working for you instead of treating them as having a shameful hobby? In your list of KPIs, OKRs or any other Rs does it say &ldquo;Get, keep and nurture mega smart and passionate people who put the consumer first&rdquo;?</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s the thing, we all agree the status quo won&rsquo;t hold.</h3><p> <br/> We all know you could become pipes (and that goes for challenger banks as well when it comes to invisible banking). We&rsquo;re up against companies who get experience intimately, have brand, have people, have an obsession with understanding the consumer and don&rsquo;t have to lie about it. We absolutely must shake the lip service, the convoluted meaningless language, the excuses about too much legacy or too little funding and the hope that these other guys &ldquo;would never enter banking, why would they?&rdquo; because at this rate, our lying amounts to such abuse of the consumer they may enter banking as sheer compassionate charity and not in the hopes of turning a profit.</p><p> P.S. My faithful readers &ndash; hi honey!- know, I end articles with a bang so the above phrase would have been the perfect point to leave hanging to emphasise the doom and gloom but that would make me guilty of the same demagoguery. This is not in the scare mongering series we all seem to write these days. This is a call to arms. I know so many of you reading this well and you&rsquo;re amazingly passionate, smart human beings who struggle with the fact customer centricity is reduced to a lie despite how you still feel everything you do is with the consumer in mind. Changing it is daunting, but it&rsquo;s doable. Let&rsquo;s break this down and figure out how to listen and care and tell the truth about our culture and what it needs to fundamentally change and we will eventually get there. </p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 16:20:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 16:20:02.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_fCraLum.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/i-am-a-banker-therefore-i-lie/\", \"post_id\": \"11728\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 16:20:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 16:20:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"i-am-a-banker-therefore-i-lie\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11727\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5718\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/I-Am-a-Banker-Therefore-I-Lie.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"886\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465920000,"author_id":160,"chart_url":""}

Use These 5 Tactics To Tighten Up Your Game","link":"first-time-manager-use-these-5-tactics-to-tighten-up-your-game","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> When I got my first management job I was really excited. <br/>  </h3><p> Of course, I pretended like it was no big deal and I tried to act like I&rsquo;d been there before, but on the inside I was giddy. When you get your first shot at managing a team it feels like you&rsquo;ve crossed over to the other side, like you&rsquo;ve graduated.</p><p> Normally at that point you&rsquo;ve had more than your fair share of experiences working for crappy bosses and you&rsquo;re determined to be the best manager these people have ever had. We all start out with this ultra-positive resolve to be a great leader. Of course, this begs the obvious question: If we all set out with such noble intentions and with such healthy perspective, why are there so many terrible managers out there? Why have there always been? Why do I feel like there always will be?</p><p> I think there are at least two parts contributing to this rather sad situation. Half of the problem, in my opinion, is a result of some basic human ugliness that takes hold under the natural pressure of management. There&rsquo;s something that happens to certain people when pressure and power converge in a leadership situation. But we&rsquo;ll save that issue for another day. For today, let&rsquo;s talk about the second contributing factor, one that is much more in our control to improve. In my experience, one of the big reasons it takes so long to become a decent manager is that nobody gives you the actual tools you need to be good at it.</p><p> Management training, leadership development, these programs seem to dwell at the conceptual level of management and never get deep enough to make a meaningful difference in the day to day activities of a manager. I&rsquo;ve done several of these programs over the years including Multipliers, which is universally well regarded. And while they almost always offer an insightful and positive perspective, they never seem to get specific enough into what a manager should actually be doing on a day to day basis. And so we&rsquo;re left to our own trial and error to develop the tools and practices we need to operate as effective managers.</p><p> Here are 5 tactics I use as my fundamentals for managing teams. You can easily implement them in your first week on the job. Whether it&rsquo;s a team of 50 or 5, these practices will help you get off on the right foot and give you a chance to be the great manager you are so determined to be.</p><h3> 1. Establish the Team&rsquo;s Shared Mission</h3><p> The temptation is going to be to gloss over this one as a management truism. Unfortunately, it takes a few tries at managing a team before you really get the importance of a shared mission. I certainly paid it lip service for several years until I began to see firsthand how powerful it can be and how negative things can get in its absence. Everything starts from a shared mission. Think of all the best teams you know &ndash; World Series Champions, Superbowl Winners, whatever team it was that delivered the iPod. You just know they had clear shared purpose &hellip; &ldquo;win the world title&rdquo;, &ldquo;put a thousand songs in your pocket&rdquo;. This is what galvanizes them, what creates a purpose larger than the individual needs of the team members. Now think of the team you work on. Do you have the same kind of mission? Does everyone know what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish? Why you&rsquo;re here?</p><p> In my experience there is nothing more important that communicating what outcome you&rsquo;re trying to achieve. And even more critical, to clearly articulate why this outcome is a worthwhile goal for the members of the team, the company and the world around them. If your team is not 100% clear on its purpose and 100% bought into its value, there is no amount of &ldquo;management&rdquo; that can compensate.</p><p> My recommendation to first time managers is to immediately sit down with your team and communicate what the mission is. It can be a mission for this year, this quarter, or even a longer term purpose. The only things that really matter are that you communicate it, your team believes in it, and you do it in week 1.</p><h3> 2. Communicate the Team&rsquo;s Shared Mission Metrics</h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve established a mission, you need to set some mission metrics. There is no reason this needs to take longer than a week either. The temptation will be to deliberate on this one for weeks and months but that is a strong indication you don&rsquo;t have a clear mission in the first place. For me, the team&rsquo;s mission metrics are the only metrics I really care about. In theory you start at the company success metrics and they roll down to each department and team until ultimately each individual has metrics born from the company&rsquo;s goals. I&rsquo;m not opposed to that in principle but I am much more interested in metrics at the team level than at the company or even individual level because I want everyone to define success that same way. It can be confusing and even damaging for a team when one individual our group is claiming success when another individual or group is seeing failure. I want everyone on the team sharing in success and failure equally and for that reason I keep everyone focused on team level mission metrics instead of individual measures of success.</p><p> My recommendation for first-time managers is to spend time with your team in the first week to map out the 3-5 (no more than 5!) mission metrics for your team. For example, if I&rsquo;m managing a Marketing team and our mission is to build a world-class demand generation engine, our mission metrics for the year might be 100,000 website visits, 10,000 leads, $10 million in sales opportunities. And then from that point onward, all our discussions, reports and celebrations will be based on the achievement of these mission metrics.</p><h3> 3. Host a Team Stand-up Every Monday or Tuesday</h3><p> Now that you have a shared team mission and some metrics to define success, you need to manage the path to achieving it. One of the trickiest things I&rsquo;ve found in managing teams is to sustain purposeful momentum towards an outcome. It&rsquo;s usually pretty easy to get people excited about something new and to get off to a good start, but a lot more challenging to sustain that purpose over many months and years. Everyone starts off with the best of intentions but then things happen &ndash; distractions, changes, new people &ndash; inevitably something comes up that clouds or confuses the mission.</p><p> One of the best tools I use to keep everyone focused on the mission and mission metrics is the weekly team stand-up. It&rsquo;s a 30-minute meeting with the entire team at the beginning of every week to reiterate the mission and reflect on the big wins from the previous week against the core mission metrics. I usually spend 10 minutes on wins from the previous week, 10 minutes on wins we&rsquo;re shooting for in the upcoming week and 10 minutes on a general message to provide guidance or motivation to the team. The team stand-up should be the anchor point in the week &ndash; you should never skip one and team members should not feel ok missing one either. In my experience stand-ups are great even for very large teams.</p><p> My recommendation for first-time managers is to book a recurring team stand-up every Monday or Tuesday and never miss one. If you&rsquo;re going to be traveling, do it remotely. If you&rsquo;re on vacation, have your second in command run it for you.</p><h3> 4. Send a Friday Wins Email to Your Team and Manager</h3><p> At the end of each week, I like to send out a &ldquo;weekly wins&rdquo; email to my team and my own manager. This is a way of reinforcing the importance of the team&rsquo;s mission and metrics. It&rsquo;s also a great way to get your boss and other executives aware and supportive of what your team is doing. One of the things that can often disrupt momentum towards a shared team mission is when competing priorities come in from superiors. By sharing your team&rsquo;s wins with your boss and other leaders, you reduce the likelihood of that happening by getting them invested in what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p><p> Another positive outcome of sending weekly win emails is it creates a desire in team members to receive public recognition. When they see colleagues getting acknowledged for wins it gets them even more invested in doing things that will result in their own &ldquo;wins&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a great situation to be in as a manager. The most important piece of advice I can offer for structuring win emails, is to make sure you only recognize wins that directly hit on the team mission and mission metrics. The temptation will be to call people out for all sorts of positive contributions, but I would caution you against that. If you want to keep your team focused on the mission at hand, you should only recognize wins that directly impact your agreed upon mission metrics.</p><p> My recommendation to first-time managers is to start sending out weekly win emails to your team and manager as soon as you have your mission and mission metrics set. I usually try to find 3-5 wins each week and I do my best to share as much credit as I can so long as the wins directly advance our team&rsquo;s mission.</p><h3> 5. Set up Weekly 1-1 Meetings with Each Team Member</h3><p> Up until this point, all the tactics have been focused on the team and not individuals. That is by design. But it is important to keep a regular cadence with each member of your group with the purpose of helping them find success in the mission and ultimately in their careers. Even in individual one on one meetings I still like to keep the context rooted in the team mission and metrics. The only difference in this case is we use this particular meeting to focus in on what the individual is doing to help advance team goals and how success in the mission will create success for them in their career path. There&rsquo;s lots of good content out there on how to structure a 1-1 meeting so I won&rsquo;t focus on that. The only thing I will say is that a 1-1 meeting with a team member is primarily about you listening to them and helping them be successful within the team mission. It is an opportunity for you to provide critical feedback when necessary but my advice is for you to focus as much as possible on listening and helping vs. criticizing and directing.</p><p> My recommendation to first-time managers is to book recurring weekly 1-1 meetings with each team member before the end of the first week.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a first-time manager or you&rsquo;ve been doing this for a while and want to tighten up your game a bit, these 5 tactics have been really helpful for me along my journey to becoming a better manager. Try them out and let me know how you do.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 16:25:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 16:25:35.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_KL2frXC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/first-time-manager-use-these-5-tactics-to-tighten-up-your-game/\", \"post_id\": \"11730\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 16:25:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 16:25:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"first-time-manager-use-these-5-tactics-to-tighten-up-your-game\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11729\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5719\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/First-Time-Manager-Use-These-5-Tactics-To-Tighten-Up-Your-Game.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"812\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465930800,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5494,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Leaning In or Leaning Out of Your Marriage?","link":"are-you-leaning-in-or-leaning-out-of-your-marriage","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I work with couples who are what is referred to as 'mixed agenda&rsquo; &ndash; meaning one person is 'leaning in' to the marriage and one is 'leaning out.' Thus, traditional marital counseling is not a good fit for them at this stage in their marriage. Traditional marital therapy works on the premise that both are invested &ndash; often in varying degrees - in the marriage and are willing to discuss, address, and resolve marital issues. Obviously, this doesn&rsquo;t mean their marriage will stay intact, but the approach to helping couples is different.</p><p> Discernment Counseling is a new and innovative approach that provides the couple the opportunity to slow down, take a breath, and look at their options for their marriage &ndash; before you pick a definitive path. It creates calm where there is distress, a platform for each person to express how they feel and hope things will be, and the changes they will make individually to make the marriage stronger and healthier. Discernment Counseling is not marital therapy and does not discuss, address, or seek to resolve marital difficulties.</p><h3> <strong>  The Leaning In Spouse: </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are the Leaning In spouse, you want to salvage the marriage but have been put on notice that divorce is on the table. The divorce process may or may not have been started by your Leaning Out spouse. Since being told about the possibility of divorce, you have experienced a roller coaster of emotions and are making attempts - often strong attempts - to change your spouses mind. In some cases, you find yourself distancing from your spouse and hoping for the best. Sometimes you find yourself pursuing your spouse in unhealthy and ineffective ways. You are often reactive to any slight that indicates your spouse is heading down the divorce path, looking for cues - either way- to help you make sense of your world which feels like its spinning out of control.</p><h3> <strong>  The Leaning Out Spouse </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are the Leaning Out spouse you are extremely unhappy in the marriage. You might have brought up divorce - and find yourself in a place you never imagined. You may or may not have started the divorce process but either way you are still not certain this is the direction you want to take. You have been confiding in friends and family and they have all shared their opinion! This only makes things more confusing for you. You find yourself needing a more objective viewpoint to gain clarity over this challenging and confusing time in your life. Your spouse who is leaning in to the marriage most likely makes things more difficult by having strong reactions and feelings about the possibility of the marriage coming to an end. This is a normal reaction because no matter how evolved we become, when threatened with a significant loss in our life, we react with strong emotions, grounded in fear. Yet, this behavior from your Leaning In spouse might make you annoyed and lead to the opposite effect and actually push you even further away from the marriage. Their strong reactions of sadness, anger, and clingy behavior may be the panacea you are looking for to relieve you of your current turmoil and distress. But, this is a short lived answer and creates an illusion that things will magically get better but just saying they will.</p><h3> <strong>  Sam and Maria </strong></h3><p> <br/> They have been married for 25+ years and have two children. Maria is leaning in to the marriage and desperately wants to stay married. She states, 'we grew up together' and I cannot see myself without Sam.' I am just devastated by what could be the ending of my marriage. Sam is ambivalent about the marriage. He is not sure if he wants to stay married. They have experienced many issues over the past 10 years and became extremely disconnected from one another. They had zero intimacy in their marriage for over three years and he is finding it difficult to get past the hurt and pain from that time in their marriage. He goes back and forth about wanting to either stay or walk away. He knows they have been together for a very long but doesn't want this to be the defining reason why they stay together. They continue to be reactive towards one another, which is dominated by a strong sense of fear. We have discussed individual changes each will need to make to help them determine or 'discern' the path they will take. </p><p> Ultimately, <a href=\"http://discernmentcounseling.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Discernment Counseling </a> helps couples decide one of three paths:</p><li> Keeping the relationship status quo</li><li> The divorce path</li><li> Making a 6-month commitment to couples counseling with divorce being taken off the table. <br/>  </li><p> As for Sam and Maria, they have started marital therapy. The relationship work they are doing is challenging and extremely emotional. They know it will take time to address and work through their issues while continuing to make individual changes, which will help them as a couple. Although they have chosen the path of couples counseling, it&rsquo;s never a guarantee. Like many couples in therapy, they remain a work in progress and only time will tell if their marriage can survive.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 16:28:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 16:28:22.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_vx2CYCs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-leaning-in-or-leaning-out-of-your-marriage/\", \"post_id\": \"11732\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 16:28:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 16:28:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-leaning-in-or-leaning-out-of-your-marriage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11731\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5720\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Are-You-Leaning-In-or-Leaning-Out-of-Your-Marriage_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1874\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465905600,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5495,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Struggling to Get Your Voice Mail Returned? 5 Proven Techniques","link":"struggling-to-get-your-voice-mail-returned-5-proven-techniques","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you&rsquo;re struggling to get your voice mails returned, then you&rsquo;re not alone.</p><p> Industry stats show that less than 10% of voice mails to new prospects are returned. Because of this, finding the right voice mail message, and knowing a few proven techniques, can be the key to not only making contact with those hard to reach sales leads, but also in developing relationships and getting new accounts.</p><p> Here are five proven techniques that give you the best chance of getting your voice mail messages returned:</p><h3> Proven Technique Number One <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t even leave a voice message! Sounds strange, huh? Well the truth is the best technique to follow when trying to reach a prospect for the first time is to persevere and call five or seven or even ten times first before leaving a message. Your goal is to catch them picking up the phone and having a conversation rather than leaving multiple unreturned voice mails.</p><p> Try calling at different times in the day, and even several times on Friday. Fridays are the most relaxed days and most people are getting ready for the weekend instead of gearing up for the week. The worst day to leave a voice mail? Monday.</p><p> One caveat: For those of you who are worried that when you do finally catch someone who picks up the phone and is upset that you didn&rsquo;t leave a message (yet they saw you called several times), be prepared with a good script! Something like: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to bother you with several voice mail messages, so I decided to just try to catch you instead. Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad I did&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> Persevering in this way is the best way to actually get someone on the phone and because most sales reps won&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;re going to be way ahead if you do.</p><h3> Proven Technique Number Two <br/>  </h3><p> You must script out an effective voice mail message in advance. Nothing will get your message deleted faster than the sound of an unprepared and unprofessional message filled with um&rsquo;s and uh&rsquo;s.</p><p> As soon as a busy prospect hears that kind of message, especially from someone they do not know (and from a sales person on top of that!), they automatically reach for the delete button. Don&rsquo;t you?</p><p> In addition, you want to make sure your scripted voice mail has these three elements:</p><li> Put the focus on your prospect &ndash; NOT on your product or service.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t ever say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take some time to learn more about you&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li> Leave your number SLOWLY and twice.</li><p> As you&rsquo;ll see in the following examples, most sales reps leave a message that is all about them &ndash; this never works. Second, sometimes they think that by wanting to &ldquo;learn more about how you handle..&rdquo; they think that they are putting the prospect first. WRONG. All the prospect is thinking is they don&rsquo;t want to take valuable time to educate you so you can sell them.</p><p> And three, the worst technique of all is leaving your phone number so quickly that you force your prospect to replay your message over and over again just to get your phone number. Yeah, right, like anybody is going to do that&hellip;</p><p> Here is an example of what to do and what not to do:</p><h3> Proven Technique Number Three <br/>  </h3><p> Turn a bad VM message into an effective one:</p><p> The WRONG way to leave a VM (and unfortunately, how most people do it):</p><p> &ldquo;Hi this is (Your Name) with (Your Company), and we offer shipping supplies and packaging for all your shipping needs. The reason I&rsquo;m calling is to learn a little more about your business and to find out more about your shipping needs and see if we can save you some money. If you would call me back at (888) 555-1234 that would be great. Look forward to hearing from you soon.&rdquo;</p><p> This message checks all the &ldquo;do not do&rdquo; boxes I&rsquo;ve listed in technique number two. It&rsquo;s all about the caller; it wants to take time from the prospect so they can &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; more, and the number was only left once.</p><p> Here is the RIGHT VM to leave:</p><p> &ldquo;Hi (Prospect&rsquo;s name) this is (Your Name) with (Your Company). We offer discounted shipping supplies and packaging, and if you&rsquo;re like most companies we work with, then you&rsquo;re probably paying too much! Our clients save between 10 to 15% each month and get better service guaranteed. To find out how much you can save, just give me a call at (SLOWLY Leave Your Phone Number.)</p><p> Once again, my name is (Your Name), and my toll-free number is: (Leave Number Slowly Again). If I don&rsquo;t hear back from you in the next couple of days, I&rsquo;ll reach out to you again. If you&rsquo;d prefer to be taken off our list, or if you&rsquo;d prefer to get some information by email, just give me a ring and leave me a message. Talk to you soon!&rdquo;</p><p> This VM is effective because first of all it is focused on the prospect and what&rsquo;s in it for them (10 &ndash; 15% savings). The phone number was left two times slowly. But the magic technique was:</p><p> You gave your prospect a way out! You let them know that they can simply call you back, leave you a message (so they won&rsquo;t have to speak with you nor be pitched when they call), and they can remove themselves from being called by you again if they aren&rsquo;t interested! This is good for you, too, as you won&rsquo;t waste your time with uninterested prospects.</p><p> One note: If you find the above message too long, then edit it! Script your VM the way you like it and then use it consistently. In fact, spend some time now reworking your existing voice mail message so that conforms to the rules above.</p><h3> Proven Technique Number Four <br/>  </h3><p> Combine your voice mails with an email campaign for maximum effectiveness. The number one law in all marketing is repetition. That&rsquo;s why Coke-a-Cola still buys millions of dollars of ads every year.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the same with getting your prospects to notice you. The most effective way is by using a two-month long campaign that goes like this:</p><p> First: Try to reach someone for a couple of weeks without leaving a VM.</p><p> Week One: Leave one VM and follow it up with an email that same day. Then leave a second VM that same week.</p><p> Week Two: Send email #2, then leave a VM at the beginning of the week and on that Friday.</p><p> Week Three: Send an email at the beginning of the week and at the end. Leave a VM in between.</p><p> Week Four: Send another email on Tuesday, and leave a VM on the Thursday.</p><p> Month Two: Send either one email or leave one VM per week for four weeks.</p><p> Also: Call in between and don&rsquo;t leave a message.</p><p> Anytime between week two and three, one of your emails needs to be the &ldquo;Should I Stay or Should I Go&rdquo; email. If you&rsquo;ve not heard of this email, then your return contact rate is about to go up by 60%! It goes like this:</p><p> Your subject line is: (Prospect&rsquo;s First Name) Should I Stay or Should I Go?</p><p> Body of email:</p><p> Dear _________,</p><p> I haven&rsquo;t heard back from you and that tells me one of three things:</p><p> 1) You don&rsquo;t have a need at this time or you&rsquo;ve already chosen another company for this.</p><p> 2) You&rsquo;re still interested but haven&rsquo;t had the time to get back to me yet.</p><p> 3) You&rsquo;ve fallen and can&rsquo;t get up, and in that case please let me know and I&rsquo;ll call 911 for you&hellip;</p><p> Please let me know which one it is because I&rsquo;m starting to worry.</p><p> Honestly, all kidding aside, I understand you&rsquo;re really busy, and the last thing I want to do is be pain in the neck once a week. Whether your schedule has just been to demanding or you&rsquo;ve gone another direction, I would appreciate it if you would take a second to let me know so I can follow up accordingly.</p><p> Thank you in advance and I look forward to hearing back from you.</p><p> Kind Regards,</p><p> If you&rsquo;re smiling from reading this, so will your prospect! Again, this is a high percentage email that gets a response about 60% of the time. Compare that to your current results.</p><h3> Proven Technique Number Five <br/>  </h3><p> If your VM and email campaigns don&rsquo;t work, then consider going that extra mile &ndash; as a top producer once said, &ldquo;The extra mile is never crowded.&rdquo; Even though a prospect may not be in the market now, as we all know, things change. And when they do, you want to be top of mind so they&rsquo;re thinking about you when they are finally ready.</p><p> The most effective way to do this is by sending physical greeting cards. And the easiest way to do that is by using a company I use called Send Out Cards.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been using SOC for years and they have made me a lot of money in sales to prospects I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten if I hadn&rsquo;t been drip marketing to them regularly. I love SOC for many reasons including:</p><li> It&rsquo;s extremely affordable to send a high quality card with a real stamp</li><li> It&rsquo;s easy and fast &ndash; you create the cards in advance and they send them automatically without you having to do anything!</li><li> You can build &ldquo;campaigns&rdquo; so you can send cards at any interval you choose (and you can build lots of campaigns).</li><li> Every card is completely customizable &ndash; you can choose from 15,000+ of theirs (and include your own message) or you can completely create your own with your own images.</li><li> It&rsquo;s highly effective. In fact, did you know that the number one salesperson in the world &ndash; according to The Guinness Book of World Records &ndash; is a guy named Joe Girard? He was a car salesman and he sold an average of six new cars EVERY DAY! How did he do it? He sent a card to every customer and every prospect every month (and one for Christmas), 13 cards in all.</li><p> Joe was so successful, that people had to make appointments with him to buy a car!</p><p> The good news is that sending physical greeting cards works in your business as well.

The good thing is that whatever you do, no matter what your position in an organization is, and no matter where you come from, you can be a better version of yourself. The most important thing is to be aware of your own development.</p><p> Here are some signs that you are preventing yourself from becoming better than you are right now:</p><h3> 1. You've become stagnant and way too complacent <br/>  </h3><p> You know you're growing as a leader if you're taking risks and exploring possibilities. Without risks, you won't be able to improve yourself. If you feel content with the things you already know and you find no reason to develop new skills, your development is certainly halted.</p><h3> 2. You pay more attention to failure rather than success <br/>  </h3><p> When you can't stop thinking about the things you were not able to do and you lose time to think of what you've achieved, you'll find it very hard to move forward. A clear sign that you've lost your way is when you take a look at your situation and all you see are failures.</p><h3> 3. You give less and you take more <br/>  </h3><p> Good leaders work hard not to gain credit for themselves, but for their people instead. If you take more than you give, you're not really trying to serve. To become an effective leader, you need to be generous, and you need to be happy simply knowing how you've helped others.</p><h3> 4. You feel that your mistakes are more significant than the lessons you need to learn <br/>  </h3><p> Mistakes play an important role in any person's success. Even the greatest leaders in the world have made mistakes, but those mistakes taught them some very important lessons in life and in their careers. To be a better leader, you should understand the fact that you're way more than your mistakes. All you need is to learn from them.</p><h3> 5. You prefer the easy way most of the time <br/>  </h3><p> We live in a highly technological world where people always look for the easiest ways to do things. Choosing the easy way, however, will not make you a better leader. To develop your leadership, you need to continuously challenge yourself and find ways to overcome any challenges. When you challenge yourself, you succeed at every single milestone that you'll reach.</p><p> A successful and effective leader knows that good leadership begins where comfort and ease end. The best way to grow and develop is not to do what you've always done, but to try new things so you can discover new abilities.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 16:41:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 16:41:25.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_KxNOMP9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-signs-that-you-are-preventing-yourself-from-becoming-a-good-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"11736\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 16:41:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 16:41:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-signs-that-you-are-preventing-yourself-from-becoming-a-good-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11735\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5722\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-Signs-That-You-Are-Preventing-Yourself-from-Becoming-a-Good-Leader.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"750\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465930800,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5497,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Business Leaders: Don't Wait For Perfect, Instead Follow These Principles","link":"business-leaders-dont-wait-for-perfect-instead-follow-these-principles","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Leadership is comprised of an abundance of imperfection. We work in imperfect environments with imperfect choices. Our team members and colleagues are imperfect human beings. Our bosses and their bosses are imperfect leaders attempting to set agendas and direction that for sure are imperfect. We tackle our assignments and projects utilizing imperfect data and information. To all this imperfection, add our personal lives and relationships. And yes, those are definitely imperfect too.</p><p> So why do we work so diligently to achieve perfection? Really, why do we even have the word &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; in our vocabulary?</p><p> According to the dictionary, &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; is defined as:</p><li> being entirely without fault or defect </li><li> satisfying all requirements </li><li> corresponding to an ideal standard or abstract concept</li><p> Looking at these definitions we begin to learn the truth about perfection. Does a workplace or project exist that is completely free of fault or defect? Is the information we gather so comprehensive that we are meeting all the requirements? Are there any human beings we see in our personal or professional lives that reflect an ideal standard?</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t wait for perfect and instead: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Delve Deeper Into Available Data <br/>  </h3><p> Leaders know that perfect data is a myth and we need to look at the information we are presented and work with that. One manager recently shared with me his frustration with missing pieces of a study he was hoping would prove his points. Sometimes we aren&rsquo;t presented with everything we need so we may want to explore more studies, ask more questions and pull together a not so obvious conclusion.</p><h3> 2. Make Decisions Based On Less Facts <br/>  </h3><p> Knowing we may never have all the facts and numbers, we still need to make decisions. That means that we must lead from a gray area, rather than from a black and white perspective. Making decisions with ambiguity is the way of the global world today.</p><h3> 3. Be More Accepting Of Other's Challenges <br/>  </h3><p> We all come to the table with strengths in different areas. How unbalanced our teams and collaborations would be if we all had the same talents and gifts. To support one another and truly lead we can:</p><li> Help others find their gifts and specialties</li><li> Stop berating the weaknesses of our team members</li><li> Share with our colleagues how we overcame our challenges</li><li> Play to everyone&rsquo;s strengths</li><h3> 4. Avoid Making Assumptions <br/>  </h3><p> When we strive for perfection we tend to jump to conclusions before thinking through the entire situation. Do you know the number one way we can stop ourselves from making assumptions? By listening completely. Just today when I was coaching a young leader, I jumped in before letting her complete her thought. I was totally off and when I let her finish, she was going in a totally different direction. Just pause and listen.</p><h3> 5. Offer Strategy Building <br/>  </h3><p> Without shoving an idea or strategy down someone&rsquo;s throat, encourage a partnering of ways to achieve an end result that doesn&rsquo;t require perfection.</p><li> Ask how they would go about completing the project</li><li> Find out what has worked for them in the past</li><li> Be present and focused when brainstorming and problem-solving</li><li> Share a story of how a particular approach panned out for you</li><h3> 6. Make Mistakes <br/>  </h3><p> To begin the dissolution of perfection, leaders must embrace making mistakes. Since there are no perfect facts or solutions, making a mistake empowers us to be authentic leaders, vulnerable as much as anyone else we work with. When mistakes are made, admit them, evaluate why they happened and then decide on a better approach for next time.</p><h3> 7. Take More Risks <br/>  </h3><p> The best plan for teams that want to debunk the myth of perfection is taking action even if it is riskier. It is far better to take the risk and be wrong or imperfect than wait around for all the facts and figures. That delay might cause a lost opportunity. Try that new job opportunity. Tackle that project that no one wants. Ask the department that you have stayed clear of to join you in solving your challenge. If you don&rsquo;t someone else will.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-13 16:47:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-13 16:47:56.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_YHtlvPW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/business-leaders-dont-wait-for-perfect-instead-follow-these-principles/\", \"post_id\": \"11737\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-13 16:47:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-13 16:47:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"business-leaders-dont-wait-for-perfect-instead-follow-these-principles\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11738\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5723\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Business-Leaders-Dont-Wait-For-Perfect-Instead-Follow-These-Principles.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"623\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465912800,"author_id":476,"chart_url":""}

When you look in the mirror? Can we actually see our best self, or is &ldquo;being your best&rdquo; just an aspirational thing? Would you know it if you saw it?</p><h3> Where do you find the reflection of your best self?</h3><p> What I find most often when I look for my best self is a gap. The gap between who between who I sometimes am and who I want to be.  I&rsquo;ve learned to get very curious, mindful, about what keeps me from being my best.  While there are many things that we can&rsquo;t control, I&rsquo;ve discovered that being and bringing my best is one of the things that is completely within my realm of control, which is both liberating and overwhelming.  The responsibility to be my best me, lies firmly on my own shoulders.</p><h3> The responsibility to be my best me lies firmly on my own shoulders</h3><p> I don&rsquo;t know about you, but sometimes I wish I could outsource it; maybe pick it up from the grocery store when I&rsquo;m running low;  Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; I need some patience, a little resilience, umm&hellip; flexibility, and&hellip; a whole lotta courage&hellip; where do they keep the courage? Or borrow it from a friend; Thanks!  I&rsquo;ll get this back to you next week!</p><p> Working to be your best can be a long slog.  I like quick results. Being your best isn&rsquo;t quick. You find you take two steps forward and three steps back every day like you&rsquo;re chasing your elusive best self while doing the cha-cha.  It would be nice to be able to see the progress more quickly.  Like if you commit to going to the gym, and you go and go and go for months, never breaking your commitment, eventually you&rsquo;ll start to see yourself firm up.  You&rsquo;ll see muscles forming.  You&rsquo;ll see evidence of all your hard work, so you&rsquo;ll want to keep working.  The evidence of all the work you&rsquo;re doing to be and bring your best isn&rsquo;t always visible to the untrained eye.  It can take years &ndash; a lifetime &ndash; to cultivate.  But it&rsquo;s there, you just have to know where to look.</p><h3> Your best self can take years &ndash; a lifetime &ndash; to cultivate.  But when you do the work, the evidence is there. You just have to know where to look. <br/>  </h3><p> So how do you catch a glimpse of your best self? You start by looking for where you&rsquo;re not being your best.</p><p> You map your daily actions from the perspective of those around you. How are you showing up? You examine the congruency of your words and actions. Explore where you need to further commit. You seek out the moments when you may have reacted in a way that&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t your best.  You pay attention to when you could have prepared differently when you could have responded more thoughtfully, listened more intently when you could have been more present when you&rsquo;re bringing tension into a situation when you may be masking yourself off so people can&rsquo;t connect. You ask yourself, &ldquo;What conversations do I need to have? What do I need to learn? What do I need to forgive myself for? What can I do better?  What is MY part in all of this?&ldquo;</p><h3> If you want to be and bring your best self, you have to ask yourself, what is MY part in all of this? <br/>  </h3><p> And sometimes the question to ask yourself is, &ldquo;What support do I need?&rdquo; &ndash; I find a lot of the time when I&rsquo;m not at my best it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve taken everything on myself and I&rsquo;m either overwhelmed or resentful (definitely not what I&rsquo;m going for).</p><p> As you get real about your answers you make different choices. Keep taking action. Do the cha-cha. Two steps forward, three steps back&hellip; two steps forward, three steps back. You learn to love the dance.</p><p> Then one day, like the reflective light of a disco ball, you&rsquo;ll see glimmers of your best self from many directions. You may not be able to pinpoint where it came from, you can&rsquo;t capture it, or touch it, but it&rsquo;s there. You. Shining.</p><p> You see it reflected in the eyes of your friends, your family, your colleagues, the people on your team, in your clients&rsquo; satisfaction, in the lives you change, in the cultures you inhabit and create, in your community.

Imagine yourself as a traveling merchant on a dusty village road in the ancient world toward dusk. Not a motel in sight, and not a street lamp either. It&rsquo;s going to be dark soon, and you are getting anxious. You knock on a door. The owner takes you in, offers you a bowl of water to clean up, then a meal, then a safe place to sleep. You talk about your business. In the morning you offer a small payment or a gift, perhaps even the offer of a little work before you leave; then you continue on your way, probably with a few leads as to who to call on&mdash;perhaps with a reputation that is just a little better than yesterday. Thus hospitality and commerce are combined. Indeed, without hospitality your very life in commerce may not have lasted very long.</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure there were as many scoundrels then as there are now. Some then, and some now, prefer opaqueness over transparency; some found it easy to put the proverbial thumb on the scale, to get a little more than they deserved. So where do we draw the line? The answer is the moment we sense that we are on the slippery slope toward a quest for power over an obligation to serve. What will you be remembered for? Will it be self-effacement over self-aggrandizement? Will you build a statue to yourself or a park-bench for others to sit on and rest? Is your behaviour temperate or extreme? Is your hand even or heavier when it comes to guiding others. Do you hide the ball or do you explain everything? Do you exploit or do you nurture?</p><h3> Are you mean or generous; and seriously, do you really see life as a zero-sum game?</h3><p> <br/> While I&rsquo;m at it, please keep in mind that kindness does not equate to weakness. You can be every bit the strong and effective leader and still leave others feeling satisfied and heard.

This means it&rsquo;s more important than ever before for advisors to develop strategies to connect with Gen Y. Any RIA which aims to be sustainable in the long-term needs a strategy to appeal to Millennials, who have unique financial needs and preferences. This guide will cover everything you need to know about NextGen clients and how to attract and retain them.</p><h3> <strong>  WHO ARE NEXTGEN CLIENTS? </strong></h3>NextGen clients are Millennials, the children of the Baby Boomer generation. Millennials have grown up around computers, using social media, and communicating via text. Also called Gen Y, this generation is notoriously known for craving instant-gratification and wanting access to information on-demand. Gen Y is also communication-oriented, having grown up in a highly-connected world.During childhood, most Millennials witnessed their parents experience layoffs and financial crisis. This means that Gen Y tends to approach financial planning with a healthy dose of skepticism.Millennials are expected to inherit a large sum of wealth from the Baby Boomer generation over the coming years. Millennial&rsquo;s major financial needs include planning for retirement and paying off student loans, among other concerns.<h3> <strong>  BENEFITS OF WORKING WITH NEXTGEN CLIENTS </strong></h3>There are numerous benefits to working with NextGen clients including:<li> Millennials are set to inherit over $30 trillion of wealth from Baby Boomers.</li><li> Today&rsquo;s Millennials are tomorrow&rsquo;s executives, high-earning professionals, and high-net-worth clients.</li><li> Millennials are the largest generation currently in the workforce, amounting to approximately 80 million people.</li><li> Working with Millennials presents unique challenges and can be highly rewarding.</li><h3> <strong>  HOW TO WORK WITH NEXTGEN CLIENTS </strong></h3>The above reasons are why many advisors are now vying for the attention of Millennial-age clients. In order to remain competitive, there are three major areas you should consider when attempting to work with NextGen clients. These areas include:<li> Technology</li><li> Marketing</li><li> Pricing</li>The rest of this guide will be dedicated to explaining NextGen-friendly strategies for each of these crucial areas.<h3> <strong>  TECHNOLOGY </strong></h3><strong> Communication</strong>The days of picking up the phone and making a call are over. Millennials are much more apt to use communication streams like the internet, email, and text to get the information they need. Because of this, it&rsquo;s important to change the way you approach client communication when you aim to work with Millennials. Try implementing the following to make your communication style more Millennial-friendly:<li> Include a link for a prospect to email you directly on your website</li><li> Include a link for prospects to schedule a virtual meeting with you on your website ( <a href=\"https://calendly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Calendly </a>  is great for this)</li><li> Allow your clients to text you with questions or to set up a meeting</li><li> Distribute a monthly newsletter via email ( <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  MailChimp </a>  works well)</li><strong> Virtual Advising</strong>Advisors who use virtual meetings are more likely to attract NextGen clients. This is because NextGen clients are more technology-centric than previous generations. They appreciate the opportunity to use technology to streamline the meeting process. Millennials are also more crunched for time than any previous generation. They see virtual meetings as a great time-saving method.Another benefit of virtual advising is that you're no longer limited to clients in your immediate geographical area. With virtual advising, you can work with clients from all over the country, and even the world.In order to implement virtual advising, you will need virtual meeting technology. Some great virtual meeting solutions include:<li> <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facetime </a></li><li> <a href=\"https://www.skype.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Skype </a></li><li> <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Zoho Meeting </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.gotomeeting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GoToMeeting </a></li>Find out more about these virtual-meeting solutions <a href=\"https://www.bridgeft.com/4-technology-solutions-for-the-aspiring-virtual-advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>.<strong> Client Portal</strong>Millennials want instant gratification more than any generation before. This means instant access to financial information is key to attracting NextGen clients. The easiest way to achieve this is through the use of a client portal.<a href=\"http://www.runoranj.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Oranj </a>is a client experience platform which provides your clients with instant access to their financial information via an intuitive client portal. Oranj allows Gen Y clients to take a more hands-on approach to managing their money, even giving them the power to set new financial goals from within the portal. Oranj&rsquo;s integrated instant messaging capabilities also allow clients to quickly and easily ask their advisor questions, appealing to Gen Y&rsquo;s text-savvy communication style.Having a functional, well-designed, client portal will give you a serious competitive advantage when it comes to signing NextGen clients.<strong> Other Technology</strong>Leveraging a back-office solution can increase your efficiency, giving your more time to meet with prospects. Rather than wasting hours generating billing statements for each of your clients, implement <a href=\"http://www.bridgeft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Atlas/X&rsquo;s</a> easy-to-use intuitive billing platform to seamlessly manage all of your client&rsquo;s fees.Atlas/X&rsquo;s simplified client-onboarding process and streamlined account management makes it easy for you to add additional clients to your book without adding mountains of paperwork to your to-do list.Atlas/X is a powerful tool for advisors that want to spend less time on billing, generating performance reports, and managing accounts, and more time working with clients. Powerful technology is key for any advisor interested in working with Gen Y.<h3> <strong>  MARKETING </strong></h3><strong> Niche Marketing</strong>Niche marketing is particularly important when working with NextGen clients. This is because Millennials are information-oriented, and won&rsquo;t hesitate to use the web to find an advisor who caters to their specific needs. The days of working with the local advisor are over. Gen Y clients want an advisor who specializes in their niche, whether that&rsquo;s teachers, doctors, young professionals, or women, the niche opportunities are endless. Check out this <a href=\"http://www.marketingwithintegrity.com/67-financial-advisor-niches/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> list of niche markets</a> for ideas.<strong> Website</strong>Millennials have been surfing the internet since childhood, meaning they expect well-designed, easy-to-navigate websites. Having a poorly designed website can decrease your credibility and deter potential NextGen clients from reaching out to you. If you don&rsquo;t have the skills to create a well-designed website then outsource the project to a graphic designer. Alternatively, leverage a platform such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Squarespace</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.advisorwebsite.com/user/register/rookie?enterprise\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Advisor Websites</a> which help people with little to no web design experience create an attractive, functional website.<strong> Social Media</strong>Gen Y is the most social-media savvy generation currently in the workforce. This means that to attract NextGen clients, bolstering your social media presence is a must. However, there are dozens of social media sites--so where to begin? Focusing your attention on three of the most popular social media sites,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> LinkedIn</a>, can help you create a solid online presence without spending a lot of time. Here is a brief overview of each of these sites:<strong> Facebook</strong>Facebook is a great place to develop your firm&rsquo;s brand. Most often, Facebook users are looking for content which is fun, interesting, and informative. Try to post 2-3 times per week on your firm&rsquo;s Facebook page.<strong> Twitter</strong>Twitter is a place where you can showcase both your expertise and your personality! Follow other industry leaders and influencers, and retweet valuable content you think is useful to Gen Y. Tweeting about current events and financial advice can help further establish your expertise in the industry. Tweeting 3-7 times a day is optimal.<strong> LinkedIn</strong>LinkedIn is a professional networking site, and you can use it demonstrate thought leadership and highlight your credentials. Make sure your personal LinkedIn profile is complete, up-to-date, and includes a recent headshot. Post an informative article or a link to your latest blog post 1-2 times per week for maximum impact.<strong> Social Media Management</strong>Worried about how much time it&rsquo;s going to take you to manage all these social media accounts? Utilizing a social media management software can reduce the amount of time you spend on social media, while still allowing you to create a positive online brand. Two great social media management tools are:<li> <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hootsuite </a></li><li> <a href=\"http://buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Buffer </a></li>Both Hootsuite and Buffer are easy to use, and allow you to schedule social media messages well in advance. No matter which method you choose to manage your social media, the key to attracting NextGen clients is consistently creating posts which are interesting and informative.<strong> Blogging</strong>Nowadays, more and more advisors are delving into the world of blogging. This is because blogging can offer your firm numerous benefits, including the following:<li> Drive more traffic to your website</li><li> Spark potential-clients interest in financial planning</li><li> Establish your expertise</li><li> Develop trust with potential clients</li>Blogging is particularly important for advisors looking to attract NextGen clients, because NextGen clients spend more time online. This means that a blog can have a big impact on how many potential NextGen clients find their way to your website! When starting a blog, consider the steps you should take to create a high-quality blog:<li> Use strong, attention-grabbing headlines</li><li> Focus on creating the content your niche market wants</li><li> Index your posts by topic or popularity to make them easy to find</li><li> Ensure your content is useful and presented in an organized manner</li><li> Use images and graphics in your posts to increase social sharing</li>Click <a href=\"http://www.bridgeft.com/blog/6-best-blogging-tips-for-financial-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a> for more blogging tips, or here for examples of advisor blogs.<strong> Strategic Partnerships</strong>Strategic partnerships can help you find the tools and connections you need to effectively work with Gen Y. The <a href=\"http://www.xyplanningnetwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> XY Planning Network</a> provides advisors with access to cutting-edge technology, compliance tools, and many other resources NextGen advisors find invaluable. Not to mention it connects you with hundreds of other like-minded advisors! While partnerships with organizations like XY Planning Network come at a price, they can help you maintain a competitive edge in the market for NextGen clients.<h3> <strong>  PRICING </strong></h3>When it comes to pricing for Millennial-age clients, the consensus is clear: fee-only is the way to go. This is due mainly to Gen Y's skepticism of financial professionals. By offering fee-only pricing, you demonstrate transparency, build trust with clients, and ensure that all your financial advice will be made with the client&rsquo;s best interest in mind.The best way to approach pricing with Gen Y is to establish an annual fee, and break that fee up into smaller monthly payments. While NextGen clients may not want to pay a large up-front fee, they can more easily stomach the idea of a $250/month payment, for example.<h3> <strong>  KEY TAKEAWAYS </strong></h3>Generation Y presents a large opportunity for advisors. However, Millennials have unique preferences which advisors need to take into consideration when attempting to work with this demographic. Here are some key takeaways from this guide:<li> Implement powerful technology</li><li> Communicate via email, text, video call, and IM</li><li> Meet virtually</li><li> Develop a strong social media presence</li><li> Blog regularly</li><li> Focus on a niche market</li><li> Use fee-only pricing</li><h3> <strong>  STEPS TO TAKE TODAY </strong></h3>Interested in working with NextGen clients? Here are some steps you can take today.<li> Evaluate your firm&rsquo;s current technology and consider more Gen-Y friendly solutions</li><li> Consider which niche market you would like to work with</li><li> Create social media profiles and begin actively posting</li><li> Critically evaluate your website to determine if it&rsquo;s user-friendly</li><li> Dedicate a page of your website to a blog and start posting weekly</li><li> Assess your current pricing model and consider a fee-only structure</li>Attracting and retaining Millennial-age clients isn&rsquo;t easy, and requires active planning on the part of the advisor. However, working with NextGen clients can be a lucrative and highly rewarding career move in the long-term if done successfully.<h3> <strong>  TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDED IN THIS GUIDE </strong></h3>Meeting Scheduling: <a href=\"https://calendly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Calendly</a>Electronic Newsletter Distribution: <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> MailChimp</a>Virtual Meeting: <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Facetime</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skype.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Skype</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Zoho Meeting</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.gotomeeting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> GoToMeeting</a>Client Experience Platform: <a href=\"http://www.runoranj.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Oranj</a>Back-Office Solution: <a href=\"http://www.bridgeft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Atlas/X</a>Website Design: <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Squarespace</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.advisorwebsite.com/user/register/rookie?enterprise\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Advisor Websites</a>Social Media:<strong>  </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> LinkedIn</a>Social Media Management: <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Hootsuite</a>, <a href=\"http://buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Buffer</a><h3> <strong>  FREE DOWNLOAD </strong></h3><p> Did you enjoy this guide?  <a href=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5bf9a219cc98dd73bb79d02e/5c0997a66a4181a6b34ae603_The%2BUltimate%2BResource%2BGuide%2Bfor%2BWorking%2Bwith%2BNextgen%2BClients.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Download it </a> !</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 15:42:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 15:42:44.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_t9cTCZJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/15-tech-solutions-to-help-you-work-with-nextgen-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"11743\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 15:42:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 15:42:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"15-tech-solutions-to-help-you-work-with-nextgen-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11742\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5726\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-Tech-Solutions-to-Help-You-Work-With-NextGen-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"981\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466049600,"author_id":90,"chart_url":""}

Nearly half of all respondents&mdash;47 percent&mdash;held an unfavorable view.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Europeans-Are-Losing-Faith-European-Union.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Trust in the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to falter as well. In a blistering note titled  <a href=\"http://www.dbresearch.de/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_DE-PROD/PROD0000000000407094/The_ECB_must_change_course.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;The ECB must change course,&rdquo; </a>  Deutsche Bank called out the central bank for &ldquo;threatening the European project as a whole for the sake of short-term financial stability.&rdquo; The ECB&rsquo;s actions have &ldquo;allowed politicians to sit on their hands with regard to growth-enhancing reforms.&rdquo; The longer the bank persists with a negative interest rate policy, the more damage it will inflict upon Europe, Deutsche added.</p><p> Meanwhile, Frankfurt-based Commerzbank is considering stashing physical cash in pricey vaults instead of keeping it with the ECB, whose policies are cutting into bank profitability.</p><p> Speaking to the World Gold Council&rsquo;s Gold Investor newsletter this month, former Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King criticized the ECB&rsquo;s negative rate policy, saying: &ldquo;If you repeatedly bring down interest rates to try and persuade people to spend today rather than tomorrow, it works for a while. But they become increasingly resistant to being asked to spend their resources now rather than save for the future.&rdquo;</p><p> Like Aram and others, Governor King sees gold as a likely solution. &ldquo;There is clearly a need to take some precautions against an unknowable future,&rdquo; he said, which is the same argument for having health insurance.</p><p> Negative rate policies are having a huge effect on bond yields, as you can see below. Over $10 trillion worth of government debt across the globe carried a negative yield as of the end of April. (In a tweet last week, legendary bond guru Bill Gross called it &ldquo;a supernova that will explode one day.&rdquo;) In Switzerland, three-quarters of all government bonds right now actually charge investors interest. The real harm is being done to retirees, who have had to pick up part-time work at Walmart or become Uber drivers to offset lost interest on their savings and pensions.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Foreign-investors-fleeing-negative-yields.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> This is prompting investors to look elsewhere, including the U.S. municipal bond market, which has attracted $632 billion in assets this year alone as of June 1. Of that amount, more than $22 billion has flowed into muni mutual funds, the best start to a year since 2009. Between that year and the end of 2015, the amount of U.S. municipal debt held by foreign investors climbed 44 percent, validating its appeal as an investment with a history of little to no drama, even during times of economic turmoil and periods of rising and lowering interest rates.</p><h3> $1,400 Gold this Summer? <br/>  </h3><p> Joining Aram in seeing the Brexit as further proof of impeding economic troubles is billionaire investor George Soros. After a hiatus of conducting any personal trading, the 85-year-old is back in the game&mdash;this time with some bearish investments. In the first quarter, he purchased a $264 million stake in Barrick Gold, the world&rsquo;s largest gold producer, and a million shares in precious metals streaming company Silver Wheaton. It appears he&rsquo;s added to both positions, indicating a bet against the broader equity market.</p><p> Now, with a Federal Reserve rate hike looking more and more unlikely this month, gold is expected to resume its bull run, according to Australia and New Zealand Bank Group (ANZ) commodity strategist Daniel Hynes. This, along with a possible Brexit, could push the yellow metal to $1,400, a price we haven&rsquo;t seen in three years this month.</p><p> Paradigm Capital also sees the rally picking up where it left off in May, noting that gold&rsquo;s trajectory so far this year resembles the one it took in 2002, the first full year of the last bull market, which carried the metal to $1,900 in 2011. &ldquo;The resemblance is rather striking,&rdquo; Paradigm writes.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"346\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Will-gold-follow-same-pattern-this-year-as-2002.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> The investment dealer forecasts gold to reach nearly $1,400 by year-end after a dip in October. It also maintains its position that this particular bull run will peak at $1,800 sometime during the next three to four years.</p><p> Whether or not this turns out to be the case is beside the point. Savvy investors&mdash;not to mention central banks and governments&mdash;recognize gold&rsquo;s historical role in minimizing the impact of inflation, negative rates and currency depreciation. This is what I call the Fear Trade, and I always advocate up to a 10 percent weighting in gold that includes gold stocks as well as bullion, coins and jewelry.</p><h3> Catching Up with Sectors and Industries <br/>  </h3><p> Because we&rsquo;re near the halfway mark of 2016, I thought you&rsquo;d be interested to see what the top performing sectors and industries were for the year so far.</p><p> As for sectors, utilities is on top, delivering more than 15 percent so far. Jittery investors, worried about slow global growth and geopolitical threats, have moved into defensive stocks such as water and electricity providers and telecommunications companies, many of which offer steady dividends in a low-yield world. Financials, as you might imagine, have been hurt by interest rate uncertainty.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SP-500-Sector-Performance-Year-to-Date.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Below I&rsquo;ve highlighted the 10 best performing industries for the year, and interestingly enough, metals and mining companies, particularly those involved in the gold space, lead all others. Spot gold is up 20 percent so far, but amazingly gold miners have doubled investors&rsquo; money. Metals and mining companies have rallied more than 53 percent.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Top-10-Best-Performing-SP-500-Industries-for-the-Year.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Many of the top-performing companies this year had some of the biggest declines last year because of impaired balance sheets. To maintain their performance long-term, they will need to show earnings.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 16:05:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 16:05:29.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_e1zLUkS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/as-brexit-vote-approaches-are-we-nearing-the-end-of-the-eu-experiment/\", \"post_id\": \"11752\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 16:05:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 16:05:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"as-brexit-vote-approaches-are-we-nearing-the-end-of-the-eu-experiment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11746\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5728\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/As-Brexit-Vote-Approaches-Are-We-Nearing-the-End-of-the-EU-Experiment.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"741\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465995600,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

We&rsquo;ve all heard that public speaking is the greatest fear Americans have. Whether this is reality or simply an urban legend, a study I recently saw in the Huffington Post ranked public speaking at number 5 among America&rsquo;s top personal fears.</p><p> As a financial advisor, getting comfortable communicating in front of a group is an excellent way to demonstrate your expertise with clients and prospects alike.</p><p> Here is a concise list of guidelines I have gathered from my own observations, my active involvement in Toastmasters International, and a Dale Carnegie class I enrolled in several years ago. I trust you&rsquo;ll find them to be helpful.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Overcome nervousness </strong></h3><p> <br/> One thing I&rsquo;ll never forget from my Dale Carnegie course &ndash; you aren&rsquo;t giving a &ldquo;speech,&rdquo; you are giving a &ldquo;talk.&rdquo; We may be terrified of giving a speech, but we rarely shy away from talking to a friend or a group of friends.</p><p> When you get up to speak, it&rsquo;s normal to feel butterflies. Just remember that you are talking to a group of friends and soon-to-be friends, and you are sharing ideas that will benefit them. It really does help.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Share what you know and what you are passionate about </strong></h3><p> <br/> These two go hand in hand. To paraphrase Dale Carnegie, don&rsquo;t just talk about a subject you are intimately familiar with, talk about one that you are passionate about, too.</p><p> Let me give you an example. I will never forget the name of an accounting professor in college. How do I remember Joy Irwin&rsquo;s name after so many years ago? Because she passionately expounded on a subject in a way that resonated with her class. Simply put, she loved accounting&hellip;and it showed! Joy&rsquo;s enthusiasm and passion were contagious.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Please share personal experiences </strong></h3><p> <br/> People love stories. Sprinkle them in your stories while speaking. I remember talking do a group of students about the economy in 2010. Half way through my talk, I shared with them what I personally experienced during the height of the financial crisis. You know, when the financial system was poised to fall into the abyss. It was a scary time,</p><p> I shared my emotions, fears, and where we might be headed. Your audience will appreciate the front row seat you provide them.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Practice, practice, and practice again </strong></h3><p> <br/> Please, don&rsquo;t read your talk. Unless you are POTUS with a high-priced teleprompter, no one likes to be read too. And don&rsquo;t memorize your speech either. Why? Because it will sound memorized and stiff. Remember, you are having a conversation with friends and soon-to-be friends.</p><p> Practice that conversation over and over in front of a mirror. Your PowerPoint graphics will lead you to the information you will share.</p><h3> <strong>  5. About that PowerPoint presentation </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s the KISS principal. Keep it Simple Stupid! Have you ever sat through a presentation in which the presenter used a PowerPoint filled with detailed tables or one that was heavy on text? I know I have, and it was easy to get lost in the weeds.</p><p> Instead, keep your visuals simple, employ humor, and feel free to use the animations tool that is a part of the PowerPoint software. That way folks in your audience aren&rsquo;t jumping ahead, concentrating on the screen and not listening to you.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Selling&mdash;not </strong></h3><p> <br/> Be very careful about explicitly telling your audience how your expertise can assist them. For many, it&rsquo;s a big turnoff. Think about it &ndash; who wants to sit through a sales presentation.</p><p> Before conducting a webinar to a group of financial advisors, the senior editor of a well-respected firm warned me not to &ldquo;sell my wares.&rdquo; He wisely pointed out my audience will have its antenna set to tune out any sales pitch, even subtle ones.</p><p> Much like a teacher, your knowledge and how you convey your information are your best sales tool. It creates confidence, positions you as the thought leader, and generates trust. These are the attributes that will win over your audience.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Goodnight </strong></h3><p> <br/> As I once learned in a Toastmasters meeting, &ldquo;Be brief, be sincere, and be seated.&rdquo; Remember, the brain will only absorb what the backside will endure. Further, it&rsquo;s a good idea to set expectations. Let your audience know how long you plan to speak if it&rsquo;s not already stated in the program.</p><p> Now, it&rsquo;s your turn to shine. Go forth and speak. And speak in a voice that will resonate with your audience.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 16:16:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 16:16:16.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_cj3fBIB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/communicate-through-speech-7-tips-to-help-you-master-the-art-of-public-speaking/\", \"post_id\": \"11754\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 16:16:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 16:16:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"communicate-through-speech-7-tips-to-help-you-master-the-art-of-public-speaking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11753\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5729\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Communicate-through-Speech-\\u2013-7-Tips-to-Help-You-Master-the-Art-of-Public-Speaking.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"763\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466002800,"author_id":101,"chart_url":""}

A duo of psychiatrists (Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe) created the <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_82.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS </a> ) after research with over 5000 patients. They found a high correlation (0.118) between stressful life events and physical illness, and their results were validated in subsequent studies. On this scale, the two most stress-inducing events are death of a spouse and divorce. This comes as no surprise, since these two events change every moment of one&rsquo;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is surprising, though, is that three of the top ten are positive transitions, including marriage, retirement, and marital reconciliation. Likewise, the top twenty includes positive events like pregnancy, gaining a new family member, a change in financial state (for worse or for better), and changing to a different line of work (whether unwanted or, more often, a positive choice). Outstanding personal achievement ranks as 25 th in stress-inducing events. We think of these as happy occurrences, worthy of parties and celebrations. Yet each one carries a high level of stress and grief as people move from one state of life to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How to Recognize Mixed Emotions </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, your clients grieve when they go through positive transitions as well as negative. Can you be the wise advisor who recognizes their mixed emotions? Distinguish yourself by asking good open-ended questions so clients know you understand in ways that others don&rsquo;t. A few examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to finally reach retirement, but you have to leave a lot behind as well. What do you really miss about your old life?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve been looking forward to having a family for a long time. Parenting is not easy, though. Taking a guess, I imagine you miss things like a good night&rsquo;s sleep or the ability to go out without carrying a minor U-Haul. Is that right, or what else have you found challenging about having a baby?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It sounds like people are reacting to the news of your divorce in ways that run the gamut from wanting to throw you a party to crying in disbelief. What do you wish people knew about what you are experiencing?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The new job is so exciting, but it has to be a real challenge, too. In what ways is your life different now, both positive and negative?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking thoughtful, open-ended questions is an important tactic for many professionals such as teachers and counselors. Financial advisors, too, can use this approach to encourage others to openly talk about how they really feel. This lets them know that you are listening in ways that others don&rsquo;t and presents the opportunity to offer comfort and build lasting trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/understanding-grief-how-to-help-clients-who-chase-after-closure\">Understanding Grief: How to Help Clients Who &ldquo;Chase After Closure&quot;</a></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 16:27:28.000000","last_updated":"2024-05-29 22:49:31.129225","image_url":"2016/6/how-to-recognize-mixed-emotions-in-clients-life-changes.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":"","white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"<p>Asking thoughtful, open-ended questions is an important tactic for many professionals such as teachers and counselors.</p>","placefilter":0,"rss_include":0,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-recognize-mixed-emotions-in-clients-life-changes/\", \"post_id\": \"11756\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 16:27:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 16:27:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-recognize-mixed-emotions-in-clients-life-changes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11755\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5730\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-to-Recognize-Mixed-Emotions-in-Clients-Life-Changes.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"629\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":34048,"author_id":24,"chart_url":""}

If you&rsquo;re sending out a monthly newsletter with a few links or a couple of newsy stories&mdash;you&rsquo;re not running a media company. But if you&rsquo;re consistently blogging and interacting with readers (on your own site or social media), writing regular articles, producing videos and/or commenting in industry or national publications, you&rsquo;ve got yourself a media role.</p><p> You produce content, no matter what else hits your business. Once you&rsquo;re running what&rsquo;s essentially a media arm, you don&rsquo;t have the luxury of deciding you can&rsquo;t deliver. So you write that blog post even though your client work that week was excruciating. You deliver the article you promised, on time, no matter what. You prioritize your content every bit as much as client work.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t outsource your media. Instead of being incidental, media has become a core piece of what you do. You simply don&rsquo;t outsource your core. Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t hire people to draft, edit, produce or distribute aspects of your content&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do it all yourself. But it does mean you must always retain control over your message and how it&rsquo;s delivered. Your content, shaped and shared in your voice, is your key competitive advantage.</p><p> You go beyond your own stories and services. You become a curator, using your voice, your taste and your experience to share a focused selection of valuable content. Side benefit: chances are you&rsquo;re soaking up this information as part of your daily reading anyway and sharing it is often exceedingly more efficient than developing new content yourself.</p><p> You own your own public relations. If you build and distribute your content steadily, you give yourself the ability to build your own media relationships&mdash;think bloggers, social media touch points and professional journalists&mdash;over time. Then when you have something big you want to share&mdash;like a book or a new service line&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got built-in relationships.

{"original_id":5506,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"For Advisors, Daring to Be Different Can Be a Game Changer","link":"for-advisors-daring-to-be-different-can-be-a-game-changer","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Mark Petersen</p><h3> Be different. Think different. Act different.</h3><p> <br/> It seems everyone&rsquo;s mantra these days has something to do with being anything but traditional. And for good reason. In such a fast-shrinking world, there&rsquo;s more of just about everything. More people. More products. More competition. As a result, standing out from the crowd requires more than simply having a great product, industry expertise, or even decades of proven results. This reality is changing &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; for everyone from manufacturers to film studios to (you guessed it) financial advisors.</p><p> In our industry, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that standing out from the crowd didn&rsquo;t matter quite so much. Before the Great Recession, as long as you built in a bit of diversification and took the time to rebalance assets once a year, you could build investment portfolios using a standard 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds and expect to see an annual return of anywhere from 8% to 10%. With that level of success, investors were generally happy with the guidance they were given, and no one was complaining.</p><p> But oh how times have changed! In today&rsquo;s environment, that old rule of thumb is not only outdated, it could threaten your ability to adhere to new fiduciary standards. The reasons include a fierce combination of three factors that have changed how advisors need to approach portfolio construction in order to achieve optimal outcomes.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Globalization </strong></h3><p> <br/> Like it or not, we live in a smaller, more connected world. From an investment management perspective, this means vehicles that were traditionally uncorrelated have reversed course. This means that stocks and bonds in almost every category are more correlated than in the past. And while this means that if the market is up, everything is up; it also means that when the inevitable downturn comes, the value of a portfolio using the old 60/40 model will plummet.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Changing Demographics </strong></h3><p> <br/> Remember when Baby Boomers were still in mid-career and busy throwing assets into their retirement portfolios? Those were the glory days when a simple discussion about the power of dollar cost averaging got every investor excited about the future and the promise of a ballooning nest egg to support their &ldquo;golden&rdquo; years. But now that Baby Boomers are pulling assets out of their portfolios, dollar cost averaging is working in reverse&mdash;a situation that&rsquo;s made even worse by extreme market volatility and some residual post-recession investing blues. Plus, with life spans increasing, those portfolios have to last longer than ever.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Low Interest Rates </strong></h3><p> <br/> You know the stats: historically low interest rates have brought bond yields to historic lows as well. A 10-year US Treasury bond currently yields less than 1.7%, delivering an annual return of just $170 from a $10,000 investment. Compare that to pre-2008 when bond yields were sitting at about 5%, and the 1990s when 10-year bonds were delivering as much as 7%. Low interest rates have brought tough times to the bond world.</p><p> In these conditions, it&rsquo;s no wonder many advisors are finding it challenging to talk to clients, especially aging Baby Boomers, about the long-term outlook for their portfolios. But the need to achieve higher yields is very real, and reaching those yields typically involves taking on much more risk than most retirees can stomach&mdash;or that their portfolios can endure. At this point in their lives, your clients are no longer focused on buying and selling at the right time. Their number-one goal is to be sure they have income to pay their bills each month. So how do you deliver?</p><p> Now is the time (as Steve Jobs said) to think different. If you look at traditional 60/40 portfolios, data shows their returns are 200 basis points lower on average than portfolios that include alternatives in the mix. According to a  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/why-investors-may-need-to-lower-their-sights\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent McKinsey report </a> , to make up for a 200 basis point difference in average return, a 30-year old &ldquo;would have to work seven years longer or almost double his or her savings rate.&rdquo;</p><p> To increase portfolio yield (and save your clients from that fate), leveraging the power of alternative investments is key. Move beyond the outdated 60/40 stocks and bonds model to deliver more valuable advice&mdash;and potentially a richer retirement outcome&mdash;to every one of your clients.</p>Mark Petersen has over 25 years of experience leading distribution and sales efforts in the financial services industry.

{"original_id":5507,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Crucial Pillar in Building Customer Experience: Trust and Communication","link":"a-crucial-pillar-in-building-customer-experience-trust-and-communication","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Communication: We know that in order to build trust with another person there must be good, two-way communication. <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s central to our existence as human beings, yet we struggle with it every day. Multiply that struggle by the number of people in your organization, and you can begin to see just how essential communication is in building trust with your employees, vendors, partners and customers.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve long been a proponent of what I call &ldquo;Return on Relationship,&rdquo; or ROR, hashtag #RonR, which is the value that&rsquo;s accrued by a person or a brand due to nurturing a relationship. That&rsquo;s no secret. We develop and grow human relationships every day of our lives. Establishing communication is essential to this process because it helps build trust&mdash;a vital component of ROR. Seth Godin says that &ldquo;In the connection economy, trust and relationships are the new currency.&rdquo;</p><p> He&rsquo;s absolutely right. However, even in this digital age many of us are still struggling with relationships. Smart phones, tablets, social channels, live-streaming&mdash;there are a zillion ways to connect with each other, and it overwhelms us. So it&rsquo;s no surprise that businesses are often find themselves behind the eight-ball when it comes to adapting new ways of communicating to business practices. We&rsquo;re used to doing things a certain way. Boundaries have been established and systems put in place. The bigger the business, the harder it is to adapt and change.</p><p> Communication via social channels must be mastered if we&rsquo;re to stay competitive, so this post is dedicated to helping you shift your thinking in terms of social communication in building and maintaining relationships. Whether you&rsquo;re a corporate executive, an entrepreneur or an employee, developing a &ldquo;social mindset&rdquo; is necessary to build trust, advocacy and better customer experience in the digital age.</p><h3> Making the Emotional Connection: Listen First</h3><p> We&rsquo;ve all heard that talking with other people (and not just talking to them) on social channels is the way to build meaningful engagement. As brands and individuals we want to build an emotional connection with our audience, so what&rsquo;s the best path for success?</p><p> I read an article in Entrepreneur by Aaron Keller, founder of the Minneapolis brand design agency Capsule that sparked some ideas in that direction.</p><p> The article was entitled: &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235628\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Don&rsquo;t Just Have Social-Media Conversations, Design Them </a> ,&rdquo; and in it Keller says that in order to rise above the noise on social channels, we need to plan our conversations so that they arrive at the right time and make the emotional connection we desire with recipients. He&rsquo;s absolutely right. And in order to achieve that kind of connection, we need to be &ldquo;in tune&rdquo; with our audience.</p><p> I&rsquo;m always talking about developing a listening strategy before you develop any content, but who are we listening to? Keller states that instead of focusing on a particular demographic or psychographic profile, perhaps we need to look at it from an emotional standpoint. Which audiences are most passionate about a particular topic, and what is their emotional state? Are they happy and excited or frustrated and angry? How are they expressing that emotion in their social conversations?</p><p> Listening helps you define the best audience pools for your business&mdash;people that are socially active and emotionally engaged in topics you care about. And this can help you plan empathetic conversations designed specifically for each audience.</p><p> Ask questions! Dig a little and find out the reasons why people feel the way they do. Let them know that you understand them. Developing an emotional connection starts there, with just being nice&mdash;being a listening ear and letting them know that they&rsquo;re being heard.</p><p> When I was young my Dad often talked to me about ways to build relationships, especially doing your homework by getting to know your prospect before you meet him or her, so you could break the ice with conversation around something that&rsquo;s relevant to them. If I was heading to a business meeting, he counseled me to get there early and check out the neighborhood and office building, and to look for commonalities in a person&rsquo;s office. What diplomas were on the wall? Were there pictures of family or vacations on the desk? Were there clues as to hobbies the person enjoyed? When I was growing up we were taught early on to look people in the eye and shake their hand.</p><p> Today we have many digital tools to help us do that type of homework in developing relationships. So I like to practice looking people in the eye digitally, which starts with social listening and observation. When you&rsquo;re doing that digging to find out why people in your audience feel the way they do, start with looking at their individual social profiles and bios. Take a peek at their feeds to see what they like to share. Do a Twitter search on a particular hashtag term to find current conversations surrounding it, and drill down through the contributors&rsquo; pages. Look for them on LinkedIn and peruse their bios and social updates. Get to know their digital footprint.</p><p> Once you have a thorough understanding of the feelings that each audience segment has around a topic, you&rsquo;ll have a better idea of how to design messages that will trigger the emotional response you want them to have toward you. How do you want them to feel about you? What action(s) do you want them to take?</p><p> Developing an emotional connection with intentional conversations is the best way to establish rapport. Without it, you&rsquo;re just throwing content out there and hoping something sticks&mdash;not the best way to establish relationships.</p><h3> Listen to your advocates as well&mdash;and incorporate what you learn</h3><p> The concept of listening also applies to working with your social advocates&mdash;those people who love your brand and love to share their experiences with you. Incorporate what you learn from them in your product and/or service development phase. My friend Niklas Myhr, the &ldquo;Social Media Professor,&rdquo; penned a blog article entitled &ldquo; <a href=\"http://thesocialmediaprofessor.com/social-media-quality-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Social Media and Quality Management </a> .&rdquo; In this post he discusses tapping your social advocates early on in your development phase, listening to what they have to say and learning more about what they want and how you can deliver it to them.</p><p> I think there&rsquo;s room for much more of this type of thinking. The old concept of keeping things close to the vest until they&rsquo;re launched is not only short-sighted, it puts brands at a severe disadvantage in today&rsquo;s hyper-competitive world. However, brand advocates don&rsquo;t just exist outside your company. An often overlooked way to approach it is from the inside out&mdash;with your employees.</p><h3> Employee Advocacy and Customer Experience </h3><p> Do your employees know and love your company, its products and services? They can be great brand ambassadors if they have the right tools. Most employees have their own personal social media accounts and are connected to hundreds and thousands of people. What if they could use their own social media presence to help promote the company brand? Think of the reach you could achieve if your employees were empowered to spread the word to all of their connections.</p><p> What&rsquo;s holding many brands back in this regard is fear. Fear their employees will say something wrong. Fear of losing control of the conversation. Fear of opening a Pandora&rsquo;s Box of criticism.</p><p> Yes, giving up control is scary&mdash;especially in the marketing of your company. But not leveraging the power of your employees in the social space is like nailing one of your shoes to the floor. Your competition will soon overtake you. However, there are more tools coming online to help brands identify and empower employees to be social advocates without the fear factor. One such tool is Dynamic Signal&rsquo;s platform, called  <a href=\"http://dynamicsignal.com/employee-advocacy-platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  VoiceStorm </a> , which enables, empowers, monitors and measures the social media activity associated with your company so that you can reward positive activity and respond to trouble. You simply must embrace new ways of engaging with customers online, and your employees can help if you&rsquo;ll let them. Look your employees in the eye digitally, too, and get to know them outside the context of the office. What are they passionate about? What makes them tick? What does their audience look like? If you&rsquo;re not looking for ways to involve your employees (and build trust with them online and offline), then you missing a huge opportunity to generate more Return on Relationship.</p><p> Another way to start thinking about advocacy is from a community-building standpoint. It&rsquo;s easy to adopt a campaign mentality in thinking about how advocates can help us disseminate information, but there&rsquo;s much more to be gained from listening and learning.</p><h3> Adopt a &ldquo;Learn-Learn&rdquo; philosophy</h3><p> Advocacy programs are great tools, but we need to be careful to listen and learn from our communities. Too often we think of things in terms of &ldquo;win-win,&rdquo; which denotes an ending, not a continuation, when instead, we need to adopt a &ldquo;learn-learn&rdquo; philosophy in our social habits when building communities. It can (and should) be done on the individual level, because companies aren&rsquo;t faceless business machines&mdash;they&rsquo;re made up of individuals&mdash;and in any community, people like to interact with other people.</p><p> I think it comes down to changing your brand&rsquo;s social goals and habits from the top down. Everyone from C-suite execs to customer service employees can practice listening and reaching out to individuals to expand conversation and deepen relationships. There&rsquo;s no substitute for this. While there are enterprise advocacy platforms out there (just Google the term and you&rsquo;ll get around 1,500,000 results), anyone can invest a few minutes a day practicing focused listening on any social platform. We&rsquo;re just not making it a priority. Why? It comes down to the old ROI argument, and that&rsquo;s where I think many brands are falling short. They&rsquo;re still trying to silo social listening within marketing and sales departments (and measure effectiveness in terms of sales, versus relationships), when it should be a company-wide practice that encompasses all business functions.</p><p> While listening is an important first step, action should rapidly follow suit. However, time and again we see brands try to make sure every duck is in a row before moving forward&mdash;or hanging onto old practices of keeping people in different departments segregated from each other on social channels. If enhancing customer experience is the goal, old barriers need to come down and everyone needs to get moving. To truly offer an Omni-channel experience externally to the consumer, we have to enable and empower an Omni-channel culture internally.</p><h3> Stop Dithering and Begin Social Dialogue!</h3><p> There are several reasons why I think businesses hamstring their social efforts, and not just from an advocacy standpoint. First, there&rsquo;s an overriding, if misguided, pressure to get things &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; on social, which is sometimes used as an excuse to avoid getting involved at all. The permanent nature of anything that&rsquo;s posted on the web tends to freak out the &ldquo;control the message&rdquo; crowd who has their fingers poised over the delete button to instantly erase ill-advised comments or content. We&rsquo;re never far removed from the latest social snafu by a public figure, or the next one to come, and that fear can be paralyzing. Not good from a customer experience standpoint (or any standpoint for that matter).</p><p> Second, there&rsquo;s a certain amount of mistrust of employees by corporations on social channels. What if they say something stupid? What if they take a photo of their posterior at the company Christmas party and post it on Facebook? What if our perfect reputation is trashed by one Tweet? What if, what if, what if?</p><p> On top of all that (or in some instances because of it) marketing departments are more concerned than ever with putting out the perfect message rather than concentrating on responding and engaging effectively. When the onus is on perfection, a single tweet or status update can take weeks to craft&mdash;and being human takes a back seat to &ldquo;branding.&rdquo;</p><p> Social mirrors real life. It&rsquo;s not as if we suddenly lose our concept of human interaction when we sit down to a keyboard or turn on a tablet! Too often, though, all of the worrying and red tape built into social strategies leads to a message that&rsquo;s been dehumanized. If people want a sterilized vision of your products, services, or brand, there are plenty of places they can find that information online. When it comes to social, though, people want to interact with real people, not bots.</p><p> And when they interact with your brand, they expect the left hand to know what the right hand is doing. That&rsquo;s why open communication across departments is crucial, from planning your overall social strategy to actually handing a customer from one person to the next along their particular journey with your brand.</p><p> Remember that your brand is what you do, but your reputation is what people remember and share. Building a good social reputation is dependent on allowing people to connect, both internally and externally. Having everyone on your teams participate in social interaction and conversation is the best way to help them give your customers the best experience possible.</p><p> Stop worrying so much about getting everything perfect, and start getting everyone more socially involved.</p><h3> Why C-Suite Social Engagement is Crucial</h3><p> By getting everyone in your company involved on social channels, I do mean everyone&mdash;from the C-suite on down. If you haven&rsquo;t picked up Charlene Li&rsquo;s new book, The Engaged Leader: a Strategy for Your Digital Transformation, I highly recommend you do so. Charlene is a well-regarded author and researcher on leadership issues, and if you&rsquo;re an executive, it&rsquo;s a must-read.</p><p> In a Forbes article recently, Li told a priceless story that I think epitomizes the attitude of many 60-something execs these days:</p><p> &ldquo;A CEO once told me, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in this digital stuff. I believe in leading people by going around, shaking their hand, looking them in the eye, and connecting with them.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;That is absolutely fantastic. I love that you have that personal approach. But you have 10,000 employees&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> With her last sentence there she hits the nail on the head. You can&rsquo;t possibly shake 10,000 hands without digital tools&mdash;yet there is still resistance from the C-suite on using digital channels to &ldquo;be social&rdquo; either with their employees or their customers. In my opinion, this is a huge mistake and one that needs to be rectified sooner rather than later. The executive who continues to remove him or herself from digital engagement will eventually have that decision bite them (and their company) where it really hurts&mdash;the pocketbook.</p><p> In her book Li also answers some of the common complaints that I hear from executives on this issue, such as &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t replace face-to-face,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s marketing&rsquo;s job,&rdquo; and my all-time favorite, &ldquo;Who cares what I had for lunch?&rdquo;</p><p> These excuses don&rsquo;t carry water anymore because today&rsquo;s executive has to know what&rsquo;s going on in and around his or her company and/or industry at all times. And the only way to do a good job of that is to learn to navigate the digital landscape and use those tools to listen, learn and engage with people at every level.</p><p> Gone are the days when a CEO could navigate his ship from the sanctity of his office, seldom speaking to employees or customers (except via a podium or a newsletter). Effective leadership requires a new, more personal level of engagement. People expect more from company leadership than a photo and a blurb in the annual report or a quote in a press release. They want to see and hear executives talking about issues that concern them. They want to know that the company they&rsquo;re doing business with (or that they work for) is led by real people with real values that align with their own principles and ethics.</p><p> But does that mean we&rsquo;ll have to spend half our day on social channels making meaningless small talk? Of course not&mdash;but we can no longer delegate engagement to marketing and sales. We need to get our hands dirty and use social channels to first listen, then engage by adding value.</p><p> Another thing to keep in mind is that many people will engage with you vicariously by watching how you engage with others. The CEO who steps out from behind the brand logo to take part in social conversation accomplishes two things: humanizing the brand and leading social credibility to their companies as thought leaders. And his or her influence is scaled by the &ldquo;silent&rdquo; engagement of others who watch but don&rsquo;t immediately jump into the conversation.</p><p> According to the 2014 Social CEO Report sponsored by Domo and CEO.com, 68% of CEOs have NO social presence on the top five social networks, and only 69% who have Twitter accounts are actually tweeting.</p><p> These are abysmal figures&mdash;but there are some executives who are pioneering leadership in the social space, and Hootsuite&trade; names some shining examples that I think every executive would do well to emulate, especially these two:</p><p> Richard Branson: Founder and Chairman of Virgin, Richard is very vocal on LinkedIn and Twitter. Plus, he not only has millions of followers on those channels, but he actively follows and engages with thousands of people. His personal brand has lent a human face and touch to Virgin and also sets him apart as a business leader whose first priority is giving value.</p><p> Richard&rsquo;s LinkedIn Influencer blog is chock-full of insights for CEOs, and I agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment from one of his posts, Behind the Scenes: How I Write Blogs:</p><p> &ldquo;Every CEO should make a big effort to get online. It is a superb platform for seeing what people really think about your company, and gives you a voice to engage with them. Those businesspersons who embrace the rapid changes of the Web are those who will be in the best position to benefit from them. But more than that, they will have a blast along the way.&rdquo;</p><p> Doug Conant: Chairman of Avon&rsquo;s board of directors, and founder and CEO of ConantLeadership, Doug is very active on Twitter. What I really like about Doug&rsquo;s approach is that he&rsquo;s not afraid to use new channels (he posts Instagram photos too), and he&rsquo;s genuine. He thanks people who retweet him and isn&rsquo;t shy about being personable. Plus, he&rsquo;s actively involved in promoting social media use in business, and helping leadership understand the value of relationships through integrity. From his blog post: Leadership Words to Live By:</p><p> &ldquo;Begin every interaction from a place of &lsquo;how can I help?&rsquo; When you start this way, your earnest desire to be supportive shines brightly. And, when you follow through by listening and being unmistakably present, people know you are truly there for them, not just paying them lip service.&rdquo;</p><p> More executives need to embrace digital channels as a way to lead by example because there&rsquo;s no turning back the clock to stay in our comfort zones. Social media is deeply embedded in the lives of most people you do business with every day. In order for companies to ensure better customer experiences and to stay competitive, social engagement must become a top-down strategy.</p><h3> Wanted: Human-to-Human Sensitivity Training</h3><p> So we&rsquo;ve taken a good hard look at our internal structures. We&rsquo;ve have figured out the bottlenecks to providing great customer experiences, and now everyone&rsquo;s fired up and committed to more and better social listening and dialogue to make it happen. Even our C-suite is getting their toes wet. What&rsquo;s next? Learning and teaching your teams how to be human online.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve all seen cringe-worthy moments on social when someone says the exact wrong thing and doesn&rsquo;t even realize what they&rsquo;ve done. It happens in debates over hot-button issues, comment threads on funny cat pictures and everywhere in between. Even well-meaning comments can be hurtful when context is ignored.</p><p> The problem is magnified on social because it&rsquo;s so far removed from face-to-face conversation. However, that&rsquo;s too often used as a catchall excuse for allegedly accidental insensitivity. Text-messaging is a great example. Texting removes the human voice from a face-to-face equation and suddenly it becomes more difficult to identify the tone of a comment. Is it a joke? Are they mad at me? If I ask, will that just make it worse?</p><p> Now, think about if your text-message conversations were available for anyone to read, in an archive that stretches back years. Those are the stakes on social &ndash; even if you delete your profile, insensitive comments have a way of sticking around. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to live in fear of saying (or having your employees say) the wrong thing, but you do need to ensure that everyone has a little refresher in sensitivity training, AND follow-up/paying attention, so that everyone knows how to #JustBeNice, speak with respect, and consider the broader context of the conversation before clicking the &ldquo;post&rdquo; button.</p><h3> Remaining Human in an Automated World</h3><p> Just as with texting, social removes important clues and cues we&rsquo;d normally use to interpret the nature of a comment. No body language, tone of voice, or facial expressions to be found. You may get an emoji or two, at best. Some marketers counter this uncertainty with emotionless buzzword soup, perhaps based on the notion that they won&rsquo;t risk offending if nobody can understand what they&rsquo;re talking about in the first place.</p><p> No matter which medium is used, humans relate best to other humans, imperfections and all. Bryan Kramer lays the case out beautifully in his book, Human to Human: #H2H, reminding us that &ldquo;businesses do not have emotion. Products do not have emotion. Humans do.&rdquo; Or try reading my books, Return on Relationship and How to Look People in the Eye Digitally to help you understand the need and huge benefit of personal communication.</p><p> Simple? Sure, but the best advice usually is. Whether you&rsquo;re marketing to businesses or consumers, you&rsquo;re marketing to humans, above all. Take the time to be courteous, consider the situation of the human with whom you&rsquo;re interacting, and the other humans following the conversation. You can&rsquo;t go wrong being considerate of others.</p><p> People will remember their interactions with you for better and worse, so do your part to make those memories positive, and you&rsquo;ll build trust. Another thing that either builds or breaks trust is how you treat their personal information.</p><h3> Why Customer Data Transparency is Key</h3><p> Big Data. Big Brother. The NSA debacle. People in the United States are feeling vulnerable. And with all the publicity surrounding online security hacks and stolen account numbers (not to mention all-out identity theft), is it any wonder that consumers are leery of giving brands their personal information?</p><p> Today&rsquo;s customers are very protective of their privacy and defensive about how much data companies collect on them. The last thing they want is to have the feeling of either being sold to or being spied upon. So why should a customer hand over his personal information to your brand? What&rsquo;s in it for him?</p><p> As brands, we need to measure the need for insight against the privilege of customer trust. Today&rsquo;s customer is very much aware of what their data is worth to brands. They want to receive a direct benefit for giving their information to you, and they also need to be reassured that their information won&rsquo;t be sold to the highest bidder. If they feel for one moment that you&rsquo;re not keeping your end of the bargain, you&rsquo;ll not only alienate them&mdash;they&rsquo;ll also share that anger with their friends.</p><h3> Believe me&mdash;the backlash isn&rsquo;t worth it.</h3><p> In today&rsquo;s world brands that violate the trust of their customers (even by mistake) have a tough time getting it back, and it&rsquo;s often an expensive fix (if it can be fixed at all). If you treasure healthy relationships with your customers, then be clear with them on how you intend to use the information you collect. Whether you&rsquo;re conducting an online survey, asking people to download a report, conducting a contest&mdash;whatever you do that requires some form of information exchange&mdash;be transparent about your motives and intent. This is important at every touch-point where personal information might be required, and especially financial transactions. Let them know on your forms, sales pages and contact pages that you will take good care of their information.</p><p> Put yourself in your customer&rsquo;s shoes. How easy is it for you to give away your own personal information? What have you come across lately that makes you begin to feel a little uncomfortable?</p><p> Now more than ever, brands need to go out of their way to take care of their customers. If we want to keep their trust, we need to think about them more as neighbors and friends than as faceless groups.</p><p> For instance, a friend of mine gets regular updates from her banking representative at weekly networking meetings about how to watch out for telephone bank fraud&mdash;especially for senior citizens. The bank rep lets the group know what scammers are up to now, and what information the bank never asks for by phone. Helping customers and non-customers protect their elderly loved ones is a win-win for them, because when people start feeling like a number, they gravitate to the brand that they feel understands their pain. Don&rsquo;t you?</p><p> So know your markets&rsquo; concerns and address them. Use your platforms to show them in detail that you&rsquo;re just as worried as they are about identity theft, fraud, and just-plain-sneaky behavior. More importantly, share ways they can protect themselves. As technology advances, people can&rsquo;t help but worry about intrusion. Be mindful&mdash;and helpful&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll avoid the inevitable back-lash from Big Data misuse.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the importance of using social channels to listen, build trust, communicate better and bring a human touch to building and nurturing online communities. However, I think the secret sauce is the ability to take a larger view and incorporate all of this into current business practices. Humanizing your social presence and ensuring that everyone practices #JustBeNice is one piece of the customer&rsquo;s experience with you. It&rsquo;s multi-layered and complex&mdash;which means we need to ensure that all of our processes (from our customer&rsquo;s standpoint) are consistent.</p><h3> Going Beyond #JustBeNice: Essentials in Delivering Value</h3><p> Let&rsquo;s look at an example through the eyes of a customer. Let&rsquo;s pretend that about a year ago, you bought a new grill at a national chain. The sales reps were friendly and convinced you to buy the store brand. The model you wanted was in stock, and it was delivered to your home right on time. The grill works great for its first summer in use.</p><p> When you take the grill out of storage for its second season, problems start popping up. The igniter stops working, so you have to light it manually. Then, before the first big barbecue of the summer, the gas stops flowing altogether. You&rsquo;re frustrated, but you figure a call to customer service should rectify the problem. Only it doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> The call seems to go well. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to reach an actual person, and everyone you deal with is extremely pleasant. However, all you want is a working grill, and as soon as possible. They let you know that they are concerned about the problem, and that the matter will be resolved quickly.</p><p> However, instead of replacing the grill, they offer to pay for repairs ($900 in parts for a $400 grill), but you&rsquo;ll wait a month for parts to arrive. Not ideal, but better than nothing, even if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Then a month passes, and the parts haven&rsquo;t arrived. You complain. They offer you $500 in store credit, which is $100 more than you paid for the grill originally.</p><p> Frustrated, you purchase a replacement grill (not the store brand this time), and make a mental note to shop elsewhere next time you make a big purchase. The customer service reps never stopped being nice, but you lost a month of grilling season waiting for them to make the decision they should have made in the first place.</p><h3> What Went Wrong?</h3><p> The solution that would have made you happy, saved the company money, and likely kept you on as a future customer was simple &ndash; replace your defective grill with a new, working grill of the same model. So, why didn&rsquo;t it happen? The problem is in the process. Somewhere in the company&rsquo;s customer service mandate, red tape overtook common sense, and your customer journey fell off the cliff because there wasn&rsquo;t a unified approach across departments in helping you.</p><p> We see this kind of thing play out every day because so much of this is now public on social channels. Many customers think they might get better/faster response if they attempt to reach out for help on a brand&rsquo;s social platforms. Sometimes they do&mdash;but more often they don&rsquo;t. And that&rsquo;s because when a brand&rsquo;s customer service mentality is broken at its core, no amount of responsiveness and being nice on social channels, or any other customer service venue, will change that. This is a huge failing that is only compounded by the social conversations swirling around the brand.</p><p> At its heart, customer service is about reaching fast, fair resolutions to customer problems. That can&rsquo;t be accomplished with kind words alone. In the case of the defective grill, maybe offering repair before replacement was a matter of policy, even in cases where it doesn&rsquo;t make financial sense. The service reps hands are tied if they have no discretion to modify that policy where applicable.</p><p> Wherever the problem originated, its consequences are clear. The customer loses, because they don&rsquo;t get a timely, appropriate resolution. The service rep loses, because they aren&rsquo;t equipped with the tools and discretion to handle issues appropriately. In the end, the company loses a customer&rsquo;s trust, and therefore his business. Plus, since every customer has social access to an ever-widening circle of friends, that loss of trust is made public, and brand reputation suffers.</p><h3> The Lesson</h3><p> Being nice and following up is important, but it&rsquo;s got to be backed by appropriate action. And this is true whether the transactions are B2B or B2C. Quality customer service requires a strong plan and a system built to resolve issues efficiently. It&rsquo;s about looking at challenges constructively and teaching customer service reps (as well as other customer-facing persons in the organization) to do the same, creating a true customer service mindset across the organization. Success requires empowering employees to make correct decisions and cutting out the red tape that leads to damaged relationships.</p><p> Customers want to be treated with respect, know that their issues are being taken seriously, and see results within a reasonable time-frame. Being nice is a great first step, but it doesn&rsquo;t cover up for a lack of results. In customer service, combining efficient results with common courtesy is essential for developing good relationships, but the real magic comes when you can find ways to consistently deliver value at every step along the customer&rsquo;s journey&mdash;not just customer service.</p><p> Hopefully, you&rsquo;ve been able to draw some conclusions from what I&rsquo;ve outlined here that will help you. Fine tuning your organization&rsquo;s ability to consistently deliver exemplary customer experiences boils down to building trust (with employees and partners as well as prospects and customers). When building trust is your primary goal, adopting a social mindset becomes more about breaking down communication barriers than just using social tools to deliver one-way branding messages and a sales pitch. Nurturing relationships using social technologies enhances what you&rsquo;re already doing face to face, and allows you to deliver more and better experiences across the board. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p><p> This first appeared on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ted Rubin </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 17:17:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 17:17:54.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_SE6ruuO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-crucial-pillar-in-building-customer-experience-trust-and-communication/\", \"post_id\": \"11762\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 17:17:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 17:17:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-crucial-pillar-in-building-customer-experience-trust-and-communication\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11761\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5733\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/A-Crucial-Pillar-in-Building-Customer-Experience-Trust-and-Communication.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"816\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466013600,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5508,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Should Forget Successes and Look to Satisfaction","link":"why-you-should-forget-successes-and-look-to-satisfaction","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My client, Marc, and I had been working together for almost a year as he grew his business from an idea into a thriving consulting practice. At the start of every coaching conversation, I&rsquo;d ask him for the agenda. This week&rsquo;s was a surprise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want to be a success.&rdquo;</p><p> I didn&rsquo;t overreact and bonk him on the head with everything he told me he wanted to create and how far he&rsquo;d come. Instead, I invited him to unpack the agenda a bit. Clearly I was missing something.</p><p> &ldquo;Tell me more.&rdquo;</p><p> It turned out that he was at a conference the week before where everyone and their grandmother was asking him about his growth plans. When would he contract out some of the work, hire other employees, expand his offering? The pressure was enormous, but it&rsquo;s pressure that turns a stone into a diamond.</p><p> Marc was clearer than ever.</p><p> &ldquo;I left my corporate position because I was traveling non-stop and wanted to be there for my girls and my wife. I don&rsquo;t want to create the next generation of the Firm I just left; I want to do work I love and create a robust life that&rsquo;s well funded. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p> Aha! Marc&rsquo;s definition of success was not the same as the other conference-goers who were primarily focused on expansion. Marc, on the other hand, was in it for the satisfaction.</p><h3> Climbing the Ladder of Success</h3><p> Most people want to get ahead and climb higher as if somehow, once they reach the right level, everything will fall into place.</p><p> I once had a client who told me that he was willing to sacrifice his family time now and make work his top priority so when his little kids are older, he&rsquo;d already be a success, at the top of the org chart, and be able to have the time for them. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p><p> When I was promoted to VP, I didn&rsquo;t have more time than when I was a manager. Title doesn&rsquo;t equate to flexibility to live your life. Yes, I could work from home more easily but beyond that, work was go-go-go 24/7. If anything, I saw my family less and was on the road more.</p><h3> There Is No Ladder of Satisfaction to Climb</h3><p> For some, success is something that&rsquo;s only recognized from the outside looking in at your title and accomplishments. Satisfaction is an inner game.</p><p> Marc realized that for him, bigger wasn&rsquo;t better. He valued saying no to work that was out of his sweet spot, working with clients he loved and feeling stretched. He didn&rsquo;t need CEO, SVP or Director of Awesomeness on his business card to do that.</p><p> Small business isn&rsquo;t right for everyone, but the Success v. Satisfaction concept still applies even if you&rsquo;re working within an organization.</p><li> Which statements resonate with you?</li><li> You feel great about your day-to-day work.</li><li> You are paid well but hate your day-to-day work.</li><li> You love your colleagues.</li><li> You hate your colleagues but just got a promotion, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li><li> Your boss hints that if you kick up your hours, good things are ahead.</li><li> You coach your child&rsquo;s baseball team.</li><li> You go on amazing long vacations.</li><li> You go on luxury long weekends because you would never take off for a week.</li><li> You don&rsquo;t long for something more.</li><li> You&rsquo;re invited to the senior leadership team meeting.</li><li> You end every day with two Advil and a beer (or wine)</li><li> You sleep well.</li><li> You get to represent your boss on important conference calls.</li><li> You are trusted with a client relationship.</li><li> You&rsquo;re challenged.</li><li> You lead a large team.</li><li> You make a difference to others daily.</li><li> You are viewed by others as a leader by virtue of your title.</li><li> You are a leader with your influence, confidence, and creativity.</li><p> Satisfaction is subjective and so is success. Yes, if you ask ten people for the definition of career success, a similar picture may emerge, but satisfaction is deeply personal. Only you know what makes you feel truly satisfied. Forget success in isolation, it&rsquo;s time to reframe the conversation giving full weight to satisfaction.</p><p> It&rsquo;s scary to think about making a change when you&rsquo;ve been on the climb for years. It&rsquo;s what you know. It makes sense, and everyone you know is doing it. It&rsquo;s also easy to let other&rsquo;s view of success become your own and not notice when your individual thinking becomes group-think.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s drop the idea that the top of a ladder is the ultimate achievement in life. Imagine that when you get to the top you notice the ocean of possibilities that would bring you great personal satisfaction. You don&rsquo;t have to wait &ndash; you can dive in now and have career success.</p><p> Much like the work-life balance conversation, it&rsquo;s time openly have the satisfaction-success conversation with yourself and with others. Be brave enough to discover and own your answers to create a life of meaning and let go of achievement that&rsquo;s measured exclusively on someone else&rsquo;s scale.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 17:34:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 17:34:15.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_dKaALw8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-should-forget-successes-and-look-to-satisfaction/\", \"post_id\": \"11764\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 17:34:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 17:34:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-should-forget-successes-and-look-to-satisfaction\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11763\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5734\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Why-You-Should-Forget-Successes-and-Look-to-Satisfaction.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"939\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466017200,"author_id":15,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5509,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want to Connect with Industry Influencers and Increase Your Brand? Follow These 5 Tips","link":"want-to-connect-with-industry-influencers-and-increase-your-brand-follow-these-5-tips","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Influencer marketing has quickly become a buzzword in the world of digital marketing.</h3><p> The idea of using influence to generate visibility for your brand is not a new concept. Using an expensive celebrity to tell your target audience that they should buy your product may not be within your budget and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. You don&rsquo;t need high-priced endorsements &ndash; you need to establish trust.</p><p> The primary element of a successful brand is trust. You want your target audience to have faith in your product, your service, and your brand. In a competitive market, developing a relationship with your target audience can be difficult. You may be asking yourself, &ldquo;how can we compete with established brands?&rdquo;  &ndash; This is where influencer marketing comes into play.</p><p> Before you can take advantage of the potential of influencers, you need to know who they are. Targeting the wrong influencers will be a waste of your precious marketing efforts. Before you begin, identify a few key influencers in your industry. The next step is connecting.</p><h3> 1) UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA</h3><p> Today&rsquo;s marketing world is largely taking place at the ends of our fingertips. There is no denying that social media has taken the world by storm. As a prominent platform for all things marketing, you will most definitely find that social outlets are a good place to begin your efforts in connecting with influencers. Find your industry influencers on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and really any place you can find them. Follow them, comment on posts, and start conversations. Here&rsquo;s another tip: don&rsquo;t neglect the power of YouTube. YouTube is a great place to find influencers. Users often subscribe to get more of their favorite content and recommendations by trusted YouTubers can go a long way.</p><h3> 2) ENGAGE WITH YOUR INFLUENCERS</h3><p> The ultimate goal is for influencers to endorse your brand. It&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to send an email to an influencer asking them to promote your business. Have you ever met a business owner who didn&rsquo;t think he had a great product? Of course not. You need to set yourself apart. Don&rsquo;t tell people why they should trust you, show them. Participate in conversations that your influencers will care about and notice.</p><h3> 3) DEVELOP QUALITY CONTENT FOR YOUR INFLUENCERS</h3><p> By now, hopefully, you have identified your industry influencers and you are following them on social media. The next step is to build trust. Remember, trust is key. If you want influencers to endorse your brand, they need to trust you. Digital marketing expert Andrew Davis advises, &ldquo;Take a content-first approach to building relationships with the influencers in your market.&rdquo; Meaningful engagement is the key to success here. Offering relevant and quality content to a conversation is a way to instill confidence and illustrate that your brand is trustworthy.</p><p> You can develop this trust the same way you would develop trust with any other peer or colleague. You show them that you are reliable, helpful, caring, and respectful. Comment on posts with meaningful replies. Share posts that are helpful to others without promoting your business. Endorse another business (yes, this means a business that isn&rsquo;t yours) that provides a quality product. Provide tips that readers can really use in your area of expertise.</p><h3> 4) ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE ON A REGULAR BASIS</h3><p> In order to illustrate that your business is reliable, you need to actively participate on any channel you have set up that represents your brand. Make sure your website is current and offers helpful information. Share posts of others you respect, especially, but not limited to, industry influencers. Don&rsquo;t stop there. Update your Facebook page, post content on Twitter, create a blog, post on your influencer&rsquo;s blog, etc. But remember, active participation is the goal. If you can&rsquo;t keep up with multiple digital channels, don&rsquo;t create them. Nothing is worse than a stagnant presence. Do you ever try to call a company that never checks its voicemail? That&rsquo;s a quick way to lose trust.</p><h3> 5) DEVELOP AN INFLUENCER STRATEGY</h3><p> Content Marketing Institute founder Joe Pulizzi recommends that you &ldquo;Have an influencer strategy.&rdquo; Most businesses who seek influencer support have no idea how they go about getting it. Identify who you plan to reach and how you plan to reach them. Don&rsquo;t expect results overnight and stick to your plan.

{"original_id":5510,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Analyzing the DOL's New Rule To Protect You From Shoddy Investment Advice","link":"analyzing-the-dols-new-rule-to-protect-you-from-shoddy-investment-advice","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Is the advice that your financial adviser gives you always in your best interest?</h3><p> It may seem like an odd question that you shouldn&rsquo;t even have to ask. But advisers sometimes push high-cost or inappropriate investments that do more to enhance their own income than the size of your nest egg. And many investors don&rsquo;t understand the fees they&rsquo;re being charged.</p><p> In an attempt to curtail these practices, the Labor Department has issued a new rule mandating that any financial adviser who recommends investments for retirement accounts must do so with the best interests of his/her clients in mind. The rule, which will be phased in next year, is expected to save individuals billions of dollars a year. However, some investors may be negatively affected.</p><h3> Why is this new rule necessary? <br/>  </h3><p> Because not all advisers play by the same rules. Anyone who manages a 401(k) or other employee retirement benefit plan already has what&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; responsibility. That means he/she must provide advice in your best interest and charge reasonable fees. But brokers, insurance agents and other advisers who recommend investments for your IRA are legally held to a much less rigorous standard. They only need to recommend &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; investments to meet your objectives, even if that advice presents obvious conflicts of interest. For example, a broker can put you in an expensive &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; mutual fund at his firm that earns him a commission even if there are similar low-cost funds that are just as good.</p><p> Of course, there are responsible brokers and other nonfiduciary advisers who don&rsquo;t give tainted advice or charge excessive fees. But the new rule requires any advisers who want to continue to sell commissioned products to be &shy;completely transparent. They will have to sign a contract with you disclosing all fees and potential conflicts and vouch that the products are in your best interest.</p><h3> Why doesn&rsquo;t this rule apply to nonretirement accounts as well? <br/>  </h3><p> Because the Labor Department&rsquo;s &shy;jurisdiction to protect investors is limited to retirement savings. This includes all types of IRAs, 401(k) and 403(b) plans, Keogh plans, Health Savings &shy;Accounts and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, which sets standards of protection for nonretirement investment accounts, has been developing its own conflict-of-interest rules for years. But powerful Wall Street firms have lobbied hard and blocked such rules.</p><h3> How will the new rule affect the way investors deal with advisers? <br/>  </h3><p> If your adviser charges by the hour&hellip;takes an annual fee based on the &shy;percentage of assets in your account&hellip;or is a certified financial planner (CFP) or SEC-registered financial adviser who already is required to abide by fiduciary standards, there will be minimal to no changes. However, if he/she works on commission, the changes may be significant. In fact, some brokers are likely to eliminate customers with accounts of $50,000 or less or stop giving advice even to customers with larger accounts than that because they no longer will make as much money from those customers. For example, at Merrill Lynch, brokers have been encouraging clients with less than $250,000 in assets to move from &shy;commission-based accounts to one of five fee-based &ldquo;managed portfolios&rdquo; at Merrill&rsquo;s online discount brokerage, Merrill Edge, which charges a flat annual fee of 1% of assets but does not charge separate trading fees. Managed portfolios require a &shy;minimum investment of $20,000.</p><h3> Will the new rule affect investment options for investors? <br/>  </h3><p> To some extent. When a financial adviser has to justify why a particular investment is in your best interest, it often boils down to cost. Are the fees reasonable? Is there a cheaper comparable product? Some advisers may become reluctant to recommend&mdash;or even unwilling to give access to&mdash;high-cost investments for certain customers even when those investments are in the customers&rsquo; best interests in order to avoid even the possibility of a lawsuit.</p><h3> Will the new rule save money? <br/>  </h3><p> For many investors, yes. Your investment costs will drop substantially if your adviser has had you in high-cost investments but instead starts putting you into index funds and ETFs&hellip;or if you select a broker who charges very low commissions for stock trades. But some investors actually could see their costs rise. For example, if you are in a commission-based account and you rarely paid commissions because you&rsquo;re a buy-and-hold investor, you might end up paying more if you are transferred to an account that charges an annual fee.</p><h3> What can investors do if they still get shoddy advice from an adviser? <br/>  </h3><p> The new rule makes it easier to bring a lawsuit and receive damages if the adviser failed to fulfill his fiduciary obligations. In the past, brokerages often required &shy;clients to waive their legal rights and accept mandatory arbitration over disputes. And insurance agents who put clients into variable annuities could evade responsibility by claiming that they didn&rsquo;t advise you to buy the product&mdash;they simply sold it to you. Under the new rule, it will be more difficult to defend such actions. In case you consider suing, maintain a paper trail of your actions and communications with your broker.</p><h3> What happens to existing investments in brokerage accounts? <br/>  </h3><p> Any investments made before April 10, 2017, will remain subject to the old, less stringent &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; rule. But starting on that date, new investments must be in your best interest even if you are putting more money into an investment that you have held for years and even if you are shifting money from an investment made before April 10.</p><h3> So what can I do before the new rule takes effect? <br/>  </h3><p> Ask whether your adviser already treats you according to fiduciary standards. If not, ask him to provide a written statement of the total fees and charges. If he recommends an investment that requires you to pay a commission or a high fee, he should explain why that&rsquo;s in your best interest. Also, find out whether he has put restrictions on what products and services he offers to you. Ideally, he should help you create a diversified portfolio by picking the best options available even if that means mixing and matching funds, ETFs and other investments from competing firms.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 17:51:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 17:51:50.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_Dj4tyTV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/analyzing-the-dols-new-rule-to-protect-you-from-shoddy-investment-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"11768\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 17:51:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 17:51:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"analyzing-the-dols-new-rule-to-protect-you-from-shoddy-investment-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11767\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5736\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Analyzing-the-DOLs-New-Rule-To-Protect-You-From-Shoddy-Investment-Advice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"483\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465981200,"author_id":372,"chart_url":""}

I had one shot of making a good one, and if I didn&rsquo;t, I risked losing the opportunity to build the trust that I so badly needed in order to do business with a new contact.</p><p> In a recent study by Princeton University psychologist Alex Todorov, people looked at a microsecond of video of a political candidate. They could predict with 70% accuracy who would win the election just from that microsecond of tape. This tells us that people can make incredibly accurate snap judgments in a tenth of a second.</p><p> Just as you evaluate potential business partners, employees and personal acquaintances on your first impression of them, others will judge you and your business by the way you come across to them.</p><p> Strong first impressions help you be persuasive because it is a very effective way of getting people&rsquo;s attention.</p><h3> Here are 7 killer ways you can make a strong first impression: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. DRESS TO IMPRESS <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dress-To-Impress.jpg\" width=\"625\"/></p><p> Appearance is our first filter. This isn&rsquo;t news to anyone so put a little effort into it&mdash;dress like it matters. A professional appearance will enhance your personal brand and the more polished you appear, the more likely you will leave a positive impression.</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean conservative or expensive, but it does mean you need to put thought into your appearance. For men, a watch can say a lot about them. For women, jewelry and makeup goes a long way in sending the right message, or the wrong one!</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Always dress for your client&rsquo;s comfort, not yours.</p><h3> 2. APPEAR INTERESTED <br/>  </h3><p> According to social psychologist Amy Cuddy, one of the best ways to win people&rsquo;s confidence is to simply to let them talk first.</p><p> It is a mistake to approach every business meeting as a negotiation or evaluation. Instead, start collecting information about the other person. Listen as they share things about themselves and the best way to do this is to engage in small talk.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Be a good listener</li><li> Ask pertinent questions during your conversation</li><li> Make eye contact to show you&rsquo;re fully engaged</li><li> Always allow others time to fully express themselves, don&rsquo;t interrupt or finish their sentence <br/>  </li><h3> 3. POLITENESS MATTERS <br/>  </h3><p> To judge by movies, television, and books, one would be left with the impression that successful FBI agents are rude, pushy, and arrogant. While kicking ass has its place in making arrests, generally the most effective FBI agent is the one who recruits people with knowledge of a suspect to work with them in gathering information. While informants come in many shapes, sizes, and smells, the agent must be someone the informant wants to work with.</p><p> Polite people are memorable because they stand out for positive reasons. They make us feel comfortable, respected, and valued. We want to be around them.</p><p> And we want to do business with them.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Step forward to meet someone, smile, tilt your head slightly downward (a sign of respect in every culture)</li><li> Act as though you are the one honored by the introduction, not them.</li><li> Never gossip <br/>  </li><h3> 4. OFFER A FIRM HANDSHAKE <br/>  </h3><p> Your handshake should be warm, friendly and sincere. If it is too firm or too weak, you may convey a negative impression. If you&rsquo;re seated when you&rsquo;re introduced to someone, stand before you shake hands&mdash;it shows respect for the person you are meeting.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Keep it short and sweet,</li><li> Remember to smile</li><li> Make eye contact when you shake hands <br/>  </li><h3> 5. ASK FOR ADVICE <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ask-For-Advice.jpg\" width=\"725\"/></p><p> In a series of studies, researchers found that when people are asked for advice, they are flattered and it increases their self-confidence.</p><p> According to these same studies, when others ask for our advice, we tend to think they were smart to come to us for help! Being asked for advice increases our opinion of the advice seeker&rsquo;s competence.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Asking for advice can be an effective business strategy. For example, when facing conflict in negotiations, asking your counterpart for advice can increase the perception that you are likable and competent, thereby leading to a more rapid resolution of the conflict.</p><h3> 6. ARRIVE EARLY <br/>  </h3><p> Arrive a few minutes early. It&rsquo;s always important to be punctual because when you arrive on time you send the clear message that you&rsquo;re responsible, capable and respectful of others&rsquo; time.</p><p> Use the few extra minutes to go to the restroom so you can check your appearance and gain your composure before you walk into an important meeting.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Always schedule extra time on your calendar to accommodate traffic delays, weather, and parking.</p><h3> 7. PREPARE AHEAD OF TIME <br/>  </h3><p> Proper preparation reduces anxiety and will help give the impression that you are competent. If you do your homework before an important business meeting, you will have a tremendous advantage over your competition.</p><p> If you are attending a networking event, familiarizing yourself with the names and industries of those attending will help you better understand the needs of your potential new clients.</p><p> When you take the time to prepare, you&rsquo;ll appear interesting and knowledgeable&mdash;two qualities that help make a good impression.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Learn as much as you can about those you will be meeting</li><li> Brush up on current events that pertain to their industries</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 18:07:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 18:07:18.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_Ckrg3iA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-dress-to-impress-7-ways-to-make-a-killer-first-impression/\", \"post_id\": \"11772\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 18:07:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 18:07:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-dress-to-impress-7-ways-to-make-a-killer-first-impression\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11769\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5737\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Do-You-Dress-to-Impress-7-Ways-to-Make-a-Killer-First-Impression.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1187\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466017200,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5512,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Riding the Ups and Downs of a Volatile Market with Index Products","link":"riding-the-ups-and-downs-of-a-volatile-market-with-index-products","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Although there are some investors who have no problem with the constant ups and downs of the stock market, there are many &ndash; especially those who are retired or getting close to it &ndash; who have a difficult time sleeping at night knowing that they could be just one slight &ldquo;correction&rdquo; away from changing their entire future lifestyle.</p><p> Over the past few years, the unpredictable investment roller coaster has seemed to be a particularly bumpy ride. But, because it&rsquo;s never a good thing for investors to panic and make major decisions that are based on emotion, what can you do in order to help ensure that your funds are still safe, yet also allowing you the growth that you need to keep up with future inflation?</p><h3> The Index Product Solution <br/>  </h3><p> Today, a fixed index annuity and / or index universal life insurance policy could provide you with the solution that you&rsquo;ve been looking for. For example, a fixed index annuity pays interest based on the performance of an underlying market index such as the S&amp;P 500, rather than having funds directly invested in the market itself. A participation rate will determine just how much of the index&rsquo;s gain will be credited to the annuity.</p><p> Many index annuities will use a cap, or an upper limit, on the annuity&rsquo;s interest crediting rate. However, the trade-off for this is the fact that these types of annuities will also offer principal protection, which eliminates the risk of losing money due to a market downturn. What this means is that the annuity owner will simply be credited with 0% &ndash; even if the market earns a negative during a given time period.</p><p> With index universal life insurance, the cash value component is credited in a similar manner. Here, the policy holder will have their funds linked to an index (or indexes), by which the money can grow based on market upturns. And, similar to a fixed index annuity, principal is also protected from downturns in the market.</p><p> In order to supplement retirement income in the future, the policy owner may take out a tax-free loan from the cash value component. This can essentially provide him or her with a tax-free retirement income from the policy.</p><p> The fixed index annuity and the IUL product will also provide you with additional advantages over taxable investments, too. For example, the funds that are within these accounts are allowed to grow on a tax-deferred basis. This means that there is no tax due on the gain until the time it is withdrawn. Because of this tax advantage, your funds could essentially grow and compound a great deal over time.</p><p> Also unlike a regular taxable investment like a stock or mutual fund, index products such as the fixed index annuity and index universal life insurance can allow for a beneficiary to receive death benefit funds in the event of the account holder&rsquo;s passing.</p><h3> Taking the Next Step <br/>  </h3><p> Although the market continues to remain volatile, your personal funds do not have to be. By taking steps to ensure that your portfolio is safe from market fluctuations, while at the same time still provided with the opportunity for growth, you can allow yourself the peace of mind in knowing that you are still moving forward with your retirement goals. Index products such as fixed index annuities and index universal life insurance can help you achieve these priorities &ndash; while also allowing you to sleep well at night.</p><p> <strong>  The key advantages of adding these products to your overall portfolio can include: </strong></p><li> Growth during market upswings</li><li> Protection of principal during market downturns</li><li> Tax-deferral on gains</li><li> Potential death benefit for a named beneficiary</li><p> It is important to note, though, that not all index annuity and insurance products are created alike. With that in mind, it is important to shop around in order to ensure that you have the product or products that are right for you.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"918\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Index-crediting-method.png\" width=\"823\"/></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-14 18:12:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-14 18:12:51.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_p0x0rXU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/riding-the-ups-and-downs-of-a-volatile-market-with-index-products/\", \"post_id\": \"11775\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-14 18:12:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-14 18:12:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"riding-the-ups-and-downs-of-a-volatile-market-with-index-products\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11773\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5738\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Riding-the-Ups-and-Downs-of-a-Volatile-Market-with-Index-Products.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"761\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1465981200,"author_id":71,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5513,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Picking the Winners: Focusing on Quality to Deliver a Smarter Smart Beta","link":"picking-the-winners-focusing-on-quality-to-deliver-a-smarter-smart-beta","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"//insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=qoe326g&amp;ct=0:v0ks54e&amp;fmt=3\" width=\"1\"/></p><p> Written by: Crystal McClenthen, Sr. Product Manager, Principal Global Investors</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a new concept: try to bet on the winner, hopefully come home with the cash. When talking about investing, Warren Buffett has said it best: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.&rdquo; The challenge, of course, is twofold. First you must, somehow, find a way to identify &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; companies. Second, you must be able to wisely incorporate those companies into your overall portfolio in a way that not only helps ensure diversification, but also aims to protect your assets in an environment of high market volatility and rising interest rates. But how?</p><p> One possible solution is to carefully pick what you believe will be the winners (more on that in a minute!) and build them into a Smart Beta ETF that seeks to provide the ability to gain access to a single risk factor at a lower cost point. And while there are as many strategies out there as there are ETFs, here&rsquo;s why a strategy designed to pick the winners may be the right route to help your clients achieve the outcomes they&rsquo;re seeking today&mdash;even in this wild ride of a market.</p><p> Ever since 2008, investors have been looking for innovative ways to try to tackle the challenge of growing and protecting assets in the face of extreme market swings and a stagnant interest rate environment. It hasn&rsquo;t been easy, but one strategy that has proven popular has been flowing assets into both dividend yield and minimum volatility solutions. It&rsquo;s no mystery why this approach has been attractive to investors in recent years, and in many cases it has served its purpose, but rising interest rates may demand a shift in strategy.</p><p> To design an ETF strategy that has the potential to perform amid the current changes, it&rsquo;s important to look at the performance patterns of today&rsquo;s high dividend solutions to understand how they might react when interest rates begin to normalize. Will the strategy still deliver value? For dividend solutions, which potentially &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; companies have the financial flexibility to sustain their current dividend policies? One approach is to try to develop a better index&mdash;one that seeks to provide investors with high income (via dividends) and earnings growth potential (via share repurchase programs)&mdash;that may work in a dynamic interest rate environment.</p><p> Of course, creating such an index is no easy task, primarily because finding those &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; companies is never as easy as it sounds. But by taking a systematic approach that dissects certain characteristics of each company&mdash;and each company&rsquo;s stock&mdash;aiming to pick the winners could possibly become more science than art. More rationale than emotion. Here&rsquo;s one approach:</p><h3> <strong>  First, evaluate each stock according to three key criteria: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Is it likely that the stock will sustain its current dividend policy?</li><li> Does the company appear positioned to maintain margins and earnings in a high interest rate environment?</li><li> Does the stock offer potential for downside mitigation in an environment of high volatility? <br/>  </li><p> If the answer to all three questions is  &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; next determine if the company is a &ldquo;price maker&rdquo; or a &ldquo;price taker.&rdquo;  What&rsquo;s the difference? Price makers are companies like <a href=\"http://www.disney.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Disney </a> <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   [1]  </u> </a> . The company&rsquo;s brand recognition, margins, sales and profitability, quality, and performance are generally solid. But when we&rsquo;re talking about rising interest rates or the potential for a down market (which, let&rsquo;s face it, always exists), we believe the most important question is the stock&rsquo;s elasticity. Will consumers continue to buy when prices rise? When income is down? When there&rsquo;s a squeeze on spending? In Disney&rsquo;s case, the answer has historically been a resounding &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Why? Parents are often willing to spend on their children, no matter how much&mdash;or how little&mdash;cash they have on hand. &ldquo;Price makers&rdquo; like Disney tend to grow regardless of the economic environment.</p><p> In contrast, &ldquo;price takers&rdquo; exhibit lower brand recognition, margins, sales, profitability, quality, and performance. As a result, their prices are often dictated by the rest of the market, and they typically have less elasticity when it comes to unfavorable market conditions. While their prices may rise over time, they may not offer the level of performance required to be a reliable market winner.</p><p> This is precisely the approach our team at Principal took when building our new ETF that tracks an index in Nasdaq&rsquo;s smart beta suite: the Nasdaq Price Setters Index ETF (PSET). The fund looks to invest in large- and mid-cap US companies that we would classify as &ldquo;price setters&rdquo; and we expect would exhibit the following favorable characteristics as compared to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The index the ETF is designed to follow, the Nasdaq US Price Setters Index, selects its components from the Nasdaq US Large Mid Cap Index. And while PSET is a new fund (it was launched on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on March 21 st ), the Nasdaq US Price Setters Index seeks to identify securities that not only possess sustainable pricing power, but also are expected to display quality financial metrics.</p><p> ##TRENDING##</p><p> Building a &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; Smart Beta is all about making choices that seek to address today&rsquo;s changing environment. It&rsquo;s all about striving to pick the winners. While not even Warren Buffett can pick every winner every time, this approach could be a good way to try to identify &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; companies that have the potential to deliver the exposure your clients are seeking today&mdash;all leveraging the innovative capabilities of a Smart Beta ETF.</p><p> __________</p><p> <strong>  Carefully consider a fund&rsquo;s objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. For a prospectus, or summary prospectus if available, containing this and other information, visit PrincipalETFs.com or call Sales Support at 800-787-1621. Please read it carefully before investing. </strong></p><p> The Fund seeks to provide investment results that closely correspond, before expenses, to the performance of the Nasdaq U.S. Price Setters Index.</p><p> RISKS Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investing in ETFs involves risk, including possible loss of principal. ETFs are subject to risk similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short-selling and margin account maintenance. Equity investments involve greater risk, including heightened volatility, than fixed-income investments. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</p><p> This Fund is new and has limited operating history. ETFs can be tax efficient in that they are exchange-traded and redeem creation units from authorized participants by using redemptions in kind, which are not taxable transactions for the Fund. However, capital gains are still possible in an ETF, and if you reinvest the earnings of the ETF, you may owe taxes on your funds even if you didn&rsquo;t sell any shares, potentially eating into your returns. Investor shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund.

Everyone has a breaking point. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before overworked employees reach their limits. Once that happens, they become completely burnt out and are unable to reach their full potential.</p><p> In some instances, employees might be kind enough to tell you they&rsquo;re burnt out in an all-caps email or a disgruntled conversation. In other instances, they&rsquo;ll keep mum &mdash; leaving you to figure it out for yourself. Here are five telltale signs that may indicate your employees have had enough:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Exhaustion </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you notice that one of your employees who had previously been super enthusiastic is always telling you they&rsquo;re exhausted, it could indicate that they&rsquo;re burnt out.</p><p> While they might leave the office at 5 p.m., overworked employees take work home with them on a regular basis. Because you can&rsquo;t expect people to work all day and have no leisure time whatsoever, overworked employees likely don&rsquo;t get enough sleep.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Sudden disengagement </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of your employees is the first to volunteer to tackle an extra project or pinch hit for a coworker. This person is always very talkative during team meetings and has a ton of ideas to share. All of a sudden, everything changes. The worker stops volunteering to help and is silent during meetings.</p><p> If you find yourself in such a situation, intervene immediately. The worker may be burnt out.</p><h3> <strong>  3. A sustained dip in productivity </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s say one of your employees has consistently over-delivered since they came on board. If that person suddenly stops producing at a comparable clip, they may very well be overworked and therefore unmotivated.</p><p> But don&rsquo;t forget that everyone has their off weeks. Have a conversation to find out if anything is wrong.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Increased absenteeism </strong></h3><p> <br/> If one of your employees has a track record of near-perfect attendance and all of a sudden starts taking lots of time off from work, it could be an indication that they are burnt out.</p><p> But don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions right away. You never know if your employee is battling an illness or dealing with other serious problems. If you notice increased absenteeism, have a conversation to see whether everything&rsquo;s OK.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Constant complaints and cynicism </strong></h3><p> <br/> Do you notice that one of your employees has something negative to say about every new initiative you launch? That might signal a burnt out worker.</p><p> It&rsquo;s perfectly understandable to not be on board with every campaign the company launches. But constantly complaining about everything is not productive. If you notice a worker&rsquo;s personality has shifted, take action quickly before they bring other people down with them.</p><p> The good news is that you have the power to prevent your employees from burning out in the first place. Just don&rsquo;t pile an unreasonable amount of work on their plates, and you should be OK.</p><p> But if your workers have reached their breaking points, you&rsquo;re not completely out of luck either. Lighten their workloads. They&rsquo;ll appreciate it. And if the damage that&rsquo;s been done isn&rsquo;t too severe, they might even rebound to former levels of productivity.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 13:25:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 13:25:45.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_k0MS9YN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-telltale-signs-that-may-indicate-your-employees-are-on-the-edge/\", \"post_id\": \"11781\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 13:25:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 13:25:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-telltale-signs-that-may-indicate-your-employees-are-on-the-edge\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11780\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5741\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Five-Telltale-Signs-That-May-Indicate-Your-Employees-Are-on-the-Edge.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"572\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466103600,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":5517,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Your Team Aligned to Pursue Brilliant Decision Making and Flawless Execution?","link":"is-your-team-aligned-to-pursue-brilliant-decision-making-and-flawless-execution","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Step 1: Let&rsquo;s define brilliant decision making and flawless execution. Brilliant Decision Making: the ability of more than one person to come together and: create solutions, choose one, see it through, observe the results, assess and take appropriate next action.</h3><p> <br/> Step 2a: If the outcome is that which was desired, that&rsquo;s great! Then move on to the next scenario requiring problem solving with more than one person.</p><p> Step 2b: If the outcome is not desired, the parties contributing to the original solution must come back to the table, evaluate/assess/etc., go to next solution and see it through.</p><p> Repeat Step 2 until achievement of desired outcome.</p><p> Flawless Execution: this is NOT perfection! This is achieving a desired outcome. If your desired outcome is perfection, good luck! I cannot help you. I am human and the people on your team are human. Humans make errors.</p><p> If your desired outcome was to be number one in market share in your industry, this is actually achievable. It is not presumed perfection! For example, you could have 25 percent of the market and the next company in line could have 18 percent of the share. Twenty-five percent is far from perfect, yet it is being number one in your market.</p><p> Alignment starts from the very tippy toes top of the organization (CEO/owner/president) and flows the path of gravity. If the CEO does not reinforce the strategy and desired outcomes in a consistent and congruent fashion, those that follow this leader cannot execute. Communication confusion can only occur and create barriers to flawless execution. And, if this leader doesn&rsquo;t communicate thoroughly, people will assume they know what the leader meant. (Leaders, a little secret for you: mind-reading is extinct in the school system; it went the way of Latin as an elective.)</p><p> Depending on what the top of the organization desires, it is possible that there are people in the organization that cannot align. There are many reasons: philosophical, personal, and possibly an individual is simply not &ldquo;wired&rdquo; to align.</p><p> For example, a manufacturing company needs detail-oriented, methodical thinking individuals in their quality control department. They have an individual that is a generalist, big picture guy and disorganized. Though this person is great for the culture, upbeat, engaging, the 80/20 of the job is quality, finding irregularities in product manufactured. This person naturally cannot stay focused or stare at product most of the day looking for defects.</p><p> As a leader, hopefully you will recognize this situation and move the individual to a more appropriate role within the company. You don&rsquo;t want to lose knowledge, experience within the company if you can help it.</p><p> If the leader is congruent in approach to strategic and heart felt desires, then the key results starting at the top are just as clear. These key results need to be passed on to each level of the organization and applied in fashion relevant to that level/team.</p><p> Without clear key results to pursue that are relevant to the individual at their respective level, you leave it up to the individual to determine what the key results are. That creates a better chance for misalignment resulting in desired outcomes not being achieved.</p><p> The information above is all great stuff. It doesn&rsquo;t start after you hire individuals into the organization. This is called &ldquo;hiring and hoping.&rdquo; The process of alignment begins with those you hire. You get the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for the alignment during the interview process.</p><p> You may like the person, their resume may shout &ldquo;exact skills/experience,&rdquo; but the conversation during the interview tells you something else. Probe deeply and get your team of probers to dig into the candidate&rsquo;s truest motivations and beliefs. Once you hire, most companies feel compelled to keep the individual for at least eight months to two years. That&rsquo;s a lot of investment with no return or less than no return when you later learn the candidate is not the right fit.</p><p> Know what your cultural beliefs/core beliefs are so that during interviews you are asking questions relevant to your beliefs and what you want.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re not sure what they are, precisely, then commence activity that gets you clear about your beliefs. Then work on getting these beliefs messaged through the organization. The most effective way is through evangelists within the organization evangelizing. Email blasts and posts won&rsquo;t cut it. There must be face-to-face time, direct communication person-to-person. Get these evangelists aligned to get the team aligned.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 15:25:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 15:25:45.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_PvjBBEo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-your-team-aligned-to-pursue-brilliant-decision-making-and-flawless-execution/\", \"post_id\": \"11784\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 15:25:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 15:25:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-your-team-aligned-to-pursue-brilliant-decision-making-and-flawless-execution\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11782\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5743\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/It-May-Not-Feel-Like-It-but-Market-Volatility-Can-Be-a-Great-Opportunity.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"644\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466103600,"author_id":458,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5518,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"2 Big Takeaways from the Digital Marketing for Financial Services Summit 2016","link":"2-big-takeaways-from-the-digital-marketing-for-financial-services-summit-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/author/valerie-jones/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Valerie Jones </a></p><p> I recently attended the Digital Marketing Summit in Toronto and was a panelist on the Power Panel:  Surmount Barriers to Transform your Omni-channel into a Customer Centric, High Performance Digital Ecosystem . The conference was very educational and a great way to meet industry leaders in the Digital world of Financial Services. Having learned some new perspectives on all things digital, I wanted to share some of my thoughts on two presentations that stood out during the conference.</p><h3> <strong>  The Keynote Address by Mitch Joel </strong></h3><p> <br/> The keynote address &ldquo; Reboot Your Digital Marketing Strategy to Transform Your Brand and Win in the New Landscape&rdquo;  by Mitch Joel, President of Mirum, and author of  Six Pixels of Separation  and  CTRL ALT DELETE  was the most interesting. His presentation provided me with a different perspective on digital today.</p><p> The first was Mitch`s story about Snapchat. Apparently, in Snapchat&rsquo;s very early days, when it was only about 5 people, Facebook offered to buy it for $3 billion.  Amazingly, Snapchat&rsquo;s founders turned it down. Snapchat&rsquo;s size and younger audience demographic was attractive to Facebook, but Mitch explained that Snapchat was quite different from Facebook. Snapchat represented the  real   world.   In the real world, most conversations are not recorded. Today, in the `virtual world`, what people really want is an in-the-moment experience and to interact in a  non-recorded  way. Mitch discussed how Snapchat, and tools like Slack and Periscope, provide the brevity and genuineness of reacting to something as it happens, just like real life.</p><p> Teenagers need unstructured time online without fear of parental criticism, which can easily happen on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Snapchat gives younger audiences the freedom of communicating in a private digital environment. Similarly, &lsquo;Periscope&rsquo; lets you broadcast live video to the world. Followers can join, comment and &ldquo;send you hearts in real time&rdquo;. In the workplace, Slack, a chatting application, has been encroaching on email as a form of business communication. Email is still quite formal but conversely Slack allows for creativity and brainstorming &mdash; similar to a face-to-face meeting. Slack imitates that experience better than prescribed emails that most work-forces use. Apps like Snapchat, Periscope and Slack prompt us, as marketers, to think about ways our own brands can mimic &lsquo;real world&rsquo; experiences to connect not only with millennials but also with all of our customers in the ways they connect with each other.</p><p> Another interesting tidbit from Mitch was that Amazon bought the gaming channel, Twitch Interactive, in 2014 for almost $1 billion. Twitch is not actually a gaming website but an Internet video channel for &ldquo;broadcasting and watching people play videogames&rdquo;. At first glance this seems like an awkward acquisition, however, Twitch is the fourth-largest source of U.S. Internet traffic. Perhaps $1 billion was worth it.  Mitch&rsquo;s take away from this acquisition is that companies should obviously be investing in video, but also that thinking differently about your business can sometimes lead to tremendous success. An ecommerce and cloud computing company is leading the way with Amazon Prime video streaming and networks like Twitch. It is now not just about content or channels, but about  networks  like Netflix and CraveTV. Mitch Joel states that Amazon&rsquo;s move into networks teaches us a potentially new way for marketers to think. Many brands are hiring journalists and other media types as a way to create more authentic, creative stories. He says that maybe the opportunity is for brands to think about not just creating and publishing content, but more about how to &ldquo;become their own media network&rdquo;. Perhaps the future is less about native advertising and more about brands becoming a network with their own studio.  Think about Purina owning a kitten network similar to AFV or Elon Musk owning a &ldquo;sustainability network&rsquo; that is all about saving the environment.</p><p> Another very interesting comment Mitch made was that the &lsquo;purchase button&rsquo; should be everywhere. He mentioned the  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bestbuy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Best Buy Facebook Page </a>  that has a tab titled, &ldquo;Shop Now&rdquo;. Mitch says,  why drive people back to your website when they should be able to buy right from within Facebook ? The Internet strategy of years ago that drove consumers back to their website is slowly dying. This rang particularly true for me because in 2001, I worked for a &lsquo;dot com&rsquo; called ePod. ePod had a unique advertising technology, that was way before its time. We called it a &lsquo;website within a website&rsquo;. We worked with companies like Disney to create an ad unit that would advertise a Disney product in a video, inside an ad unit with a &lsquo;buy now&rsquo; or &lsquo;add to cart&rsquo; functionality built-in.  Yes, ePod was quite a way before its time.</p><p> My final takeaways from Mitch&rsquo;s presentation were that we, as financial services marketers, need to ensure that we represent real-life. Marketing with flexibility, creativity, authenticity, and kindness. He said those were the keys to developing great businesses. In a digitally centric world, authenticity and creating and developing real relationships are the keys to success.</p><h3> <strong>  Facebook&rsquo;s Erin Elofson </strong></h3><p> <br/> Erin Elofson, Director of Financial Services at Facebook, sold the benefits of Facebook advertising, but she did it in a very educational way. I have spent a fair bit of time trying to find the secrets to effective Facebook advertising &ndash; with some great success &ndash; but I always thought that we could do better. Of course, video advertising was lauded as the key to success. Video on Facebook has exploded, but the most enlightening was Erin&rsquo;s comments on storytelling and driving people down the purchasing funnel. In hindsight, it is common sense, but Erin&rsquo;s examples and success stories sent a strong message to the DMFS audience.</p><p> If you are a believer in content marketing, then you know that ebooks, case studies and blogs that educate the consumer before asking them to buy are significantly more effective than content that immediately asks people to take action 1 . Erin says that Facebook advertising should do the same. Campaigns that &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; different ads work best. The first ad should tell the brand story. For example, &ldquo;our community focused bank supports people who lost their homes in Fort McMurray with a 1% mortgage&rdquo;. The next ad in the &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; should provide product information. For example, &ldquo;our bank will transfer your mortgage over from another bank with no penalty&rdquo;. Only after these two ads have run one after the other, should the message include a call-to-action such as stating the current mortgage rate and inviting the audience to click to apply.  Erin also showed a simple formula for taking existing television or YouTube video ads and paring them back to become effective brand stories in Facebook.</p><p> From personal experiences, acting too quickly by asking people to take action immediately, without persuading them down the purchasing funnel through story telling, takes discipline. In a world where CEOs and shareholders are clamoring for quick results to meet quarter-end numbers, it is very tempting to ask prospects immediately to &lsquo;buy-now&rsquo;. I get many sales calls right after I download a piece of content. We often wrongly assume that if the product is as good as we think it is, or if they are the right target audience, they will buy. And if they don&rsquo;t buy or click now, they never will. Erin brought American Express to the stage to tell their Facebook advertising story. American Express explained that once they adopted this disciplined approach to Facebook advertising, or &lsquo;story telling&rsquo;, the results were overwhelmingly positive. Research from Adaptly 2 , published by Facebook, concurs with the same results:</p><p> Among those who were exposed to the sequenced ads compared to those who were exposed to the non-sequenced ads, there was an 87% increase in people visiting the landing page and a 56% increase in subscription rates. In addition, they converted at higher rates.</p><p> When you think of this approach, it makes total sense. I am on Facebook reading my friends&rsquo; updates, looking at their photos, watching funny videos and reading news about a movie star&rsquo;s dress. Do I really want some stranger telling me to buy their product?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to see funny videos or moving stories related to the brand to get to know them before I am asked to buy?</p><p> &ldquo;Some advertisers may find it counterintuitive to elongate a campaign as a way to more gradually bring their audience through the purchase funnel, rather than more immediately delivering a call-to-action,&rdquo; says Adaptly&rsquo;s CEO, Nikhil Sethi. &ldquo;But we have proven that this classic brand-building approach it is both effective and efficient, even for direct response advertising.&rdquo; 3</p><p> My most memorable brand video on Facebook was the  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIEIvi2MuEk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Westjet Christmas Miracle </a> . That doubled my affinity for the airline. My resulting perception is a kind airline that cares about their people and their customers. As a marketer, I am surprised that I would feel that way about a brand solely based on their marketing.</p><p> Other themes of the Digital Marketing Financial Summit, were personalization, utilizing data to deliver better customer experiences,  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/omni-channel-key-optimizing-customer-experiences/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  omni-channel </a>  challenges, using attribution for measuring advertising and more.  Lastly, as a regular conference participant, I was very pleased to see how engaged the attendees were. Attendees had many questions for the presenters. When visiting our booth, they were open to hearing about our products and services rather than just the giveaways we had at the booth. Conferences like DMFS provide us with the ability to step outside the office to learn, develop relationships, and talk to people in the &ldquo; real world&rdquo;.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 15:29:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 15:29:55.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_vbwhqiQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/2-big-takeaways-from-the-digital-marketing-for-financial-services-summit-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"11786\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 15:29:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 15:29:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"2-big-takeaways-from-the-digital-marketing-for-financial-services-summit-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11785\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5744\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2-Big-Takeaways-from-the-Digital-Marketing-for-Financial-Services-Summit-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"763\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466071200,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}

Your strategies are how you want to achieve your goals &ndash; your tactics are what you need to &ldquo;do&rdquo; to implement those strategies and achieve your goals.</p><h3> STRATEGIES (A PRIMER) <br/>  </h3><p> One could ask whether or not the only important marketing strategy is to increase sales and grow the business. Well, maybe. But a significant number of our financial clients come to us not just because they want to attract more clients&hellip; they come to us because they want &ldquo;better&rdquo; clients.</p><p> For that very reason, we believe that one of the most significant advisor marketing strategies is to have a compelling advisor brand.</p><p> It&rsquo;s essential to have a solid and, as much as possible, a unique expression of who you are and what you do better (or differently) than others in your area of expertise. A good brand sets the tone, helps you get noticed for the right reasons and gives you the instant credibility your marketing tactics need to succeed.</p><p> Since this article is about Tactics and not Strategies, I won&rsquo;t belabor the point here but whatever the list of strategies are four your firm, establishing or solidifying your brand should be on that list.</p><h3> TACTICS (THE DETAILS) <br/>  </h3><p> When it comes to marketing tactics for your financial advisor business, there are no magic bullets. Every advisor marketing tactic listed below needs a coordinated and significant effort for you to enjoy its success &ndash; and build your success.</p><p> The tactics listed below are categorized into levels of importance.

{"original_id":5520,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Changing Firms? Make Sure You Aware Of These 4 Hurdles","link":"changing-firms-make-sure-you-aware-of-these-4-hurdles","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Changing firms is a major undertaking&mdash;however it&rsquo;s often the lack of transparency surrounding what&rsquo;s actually involved in making a move that can make it seem more overwhelming for advisors. <br/>  </h3><p> Over the past several years, movement among advisors has risen to record levels and as a result, most firms have the onboarding and transition process down to a science. That said, a change in employment for a financial advisor is unlike a career move in any other industry&mdash;there&rsquo;s no 2-week notice given to your employer and no exit interview to be had. After months of performing due diligence on a prospective firm, understanding the nuances of what&rsquo;s actually involved in a move prior to jumping ship is critical and will ensure a smooth and successful transition for both you and your clients.</p><p> Just as your clients trust you to be as thorough as possible when it comes to their financial well-being, there are a myriad of details that must be reviewed and followed once you&rsquo;ve decided to change jerseys. Here are four things you need to be ready for/aware of:</p><h3> 1. The Broker Protocol <br/>  </h3><p> Since 2004, the Protocol has served those advisors leaving for greener pastures particularly well. Intended to ensure that clients&rsquo; interests were protected, the Protocol defines just what advisors can and can&rsquo;t take with them in terms of client information. While temporary restraining orders are largely a thing of the past, advisors who disregard the guidelines of Protocol will likely find themselves in court incurring costly legal fees and with a transition that will most certainly be derailed.</p><h3> 2. Attorney <br/>  </h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve committed to making a move, it&rsquo;s imperative that you retain an attorney who specializes in advisor transition, as there are rules and regulations specific to the brokerage business that only a specialist will be familiar with. Your attorney should review both existing and new employment contracts, and guide you through the terms of the Protocol prior to departure day. While most prospective firms will require that you speak with their internal counsel, keep in mind that by retaining your own attorney you&rsquo;ll have someone working as your personal advocate as well.</p><h3> 3, Contracts, Memo of Understanding and Transition Packages <br/>  </h3><p> After months of vetting a firm&rsquo;s platform and resources to ensure that you can serve your clients in the best way possible, you&rsquo;re ready to sign on the dotted line. However, as a fiduciary of your current firm &ndash; and according to the terms outlined in the Protocol &ndash; actual contracts requiring your signature may not be available until just before you move. A sample contract outlining the details of a transition package, including the terms of the forgivable loan, should be obtained for review by both you and your attorney. As for those details that have been individually negotiated, you should request a Memo of Understanding as an addendum to your contract.</p><h3> 4. Talking to Clients: <br/>  </h3><p> Advisors who choose to move do so because they have reached the proverbial &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo; in terms of their ability to service clients and grow their businesses. After months of due diligence to ensure that a move will benefit your clients, you must be able to clearly articulate the upside as far as &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it&rdquo; for them.</p><p> For example, will you have greater freedom and control as far as products and fees? Will there be less bureaucracy to deal with, which in turn will allow you to devote more time to your clients&rsquo; needs? Whatever the benefits are, you have a short window of opportunity to reach out to clients after having made a move and it&rsquo;s imperative that your positioning statement and value proposition be solid. Many clients may ask why nothing was said to them about your intentions prior to a move: Keep in mind that per the Protocol, advisors are restricted from soliciting clients or sharing any details about a new firm prior to a move. However, many advisors opt to have very general, rather benign conversations with clients to assure client loyalty once they know a move is in on the horizon. A qualified attorney can guide you on what you can and can&rsquo;t say.</p><p> Change can be invigorating, however not knowing what it takes to get to the other side can understandably lead to some trepidation. Advisors who have strong relationships with their clients and transition their business for all of the right reasons will likely find that clients are more loyal to them than to their previous firm. Be thoughtful with your due diligence and well prepared, and when the time comes to jump ship, you may wonder why you didn&rsquo;t do so sooner.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 15:39:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 15:39:16.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_DTF0K0V.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/changing-firms-make-sure-you-aware-of-these-4-hurdles/\", \"post_id\": \"11790\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 15:39:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 15:39:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"changing-firms-make-sure-you-aware-of-these-4-hurdles\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11789\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5746\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Changing-Firms-Make-Sure-You-Aware-Of-These-4-Hurdles.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"813\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466067600,"author_id":133,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5521,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Today's CRM Technology for Business Blows My Mind!","link":"todays-crm-technology-for-business-blows-my-mind","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This morning I was talking with a colleague about the resources we used to keep track of vital information on our clients and prospects in the 1980s and early 1990s. There was a Rolodex, notes scribbled on note pads and more notes written on the back of business cards. I actually created a three-ring binder and a page for each of my Top 100 clients. That page had a list of numerous facts about each client, such as birthday, anniversary, favorite sports and activities, college they attended, children&rsquo;s names, favorite places to travel, etc.  I also knew what their favorite mutual fund and annuity products were, how often they wanted me to contact them and what value-added programs they wanted me to teach their team.  Some preferred a phone call while others wanted to meet in person. When I knew what they expected from me, it was up to me to do what they expected. I learned all of this by asking questions over the years and paying close attention to their answers.</p><p> That info was very useful to me for two reasons. I knew what was important to them and it also helped me cross-sell other products that would fit into their product mix to help their clients. The only real problem with that data was that it was only visible by me. Some companies used CRM software such as ACT or Goldmine, but back then we didn&rsquo;t have laptops, tablets or smart phones while we were on the road as sales reps and account executives. But, we did the best we could and still sold hundreds of millions of dollars in mutual funds. I always blasted beyond my quotas and sales goals because of the strong relationships I had in my territory. It was easy to me because I really liked my clients and they knew it. Twenty years later, I still have some of those business cards with my notes written on the back. Great salespeople continue focusing on relationships and providing an excellent experience for their customers and prospects. Now thanks to technology, this practice has become much easier to excel at.</p><h3> Today, the technology that is available for CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is mind-blowing.</h3><p> <br/> As I look back at how I kept track of my clients and prospects, it seems like I was working in the dark ages. That information was only available to me, unless I photocopied all the info and sent it to the home office sales desk. Now there are spectacular programs with Salesforce, Oracle, Google and a host of other excellent companies that gather data from social media, their account executives, inside sales reps and a variety of other sources. What makes this information even more powerful is that it is available 24/7 for entire companies to see thanks to the Cloud. Armed with this information, companies can sell more effectively, market with intelligence, keep the customer happier and be more useful to their sales teams as well as their customers. This is one of the most exciting times in history to be in sales. The resources to help you excel seem endless. I DO hope you are using them to maximize your efforts.</p><p> In Chapter 4 of my book, <strong>  <u>   The Best Practices of Successful Financial Advisors  </u> </strong> , I talk about the importance of strengthening relationships with your clients by learning about them, what&rsquo;s important to them, personal information about their life and the challenges they face in business, just to name a few of the twenty-five things I knew about every one of my top 100 clients. Of the hundreds of successful salespeople I know, every one of them follows this practice.  They want their clients to have such a fantastic experience, that they become raving fans who will share referrals and personal introductions without being asked. They are also embracing today&rsquo;s technology and the CRM systems available. What are you doing to run a more efficient and successful business? Half the year has already flown by as I write this in June. Are you reaching your goals and going beyond your quotas? Have you changed a few habits that were holding you back from the level of success you passionately desire? Are you truly doing the best you can? Are you using one of the CRM systems yet? Sometimes changing our ways can seem difficult, until we step out of our comfort zone and try something new. What do you have to lose and what do you have to gain? Be the leader. A leader takes people where they want to go. A great leader takes people where they don&rsquo;t want to go, but ought to be!</p><p> Consider June to be the clean slate and the moment you make a few changes as to how you do business. Use the valuable resources available to maximize your results. Leave your comfort zone. Although a comfort zone may be an easy, calm and beautiful place to be, remember that nothing grows there.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 15:48:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 15:48:32.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_ISFgjaa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/todays-crm-technology-for-business-blows-my-mind/\", \"post_id\": \"11792\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 15:48:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 15:48:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"todays-crm-technology-for-business-blows-my-mind\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11791\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5747\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Today\\u2019s-CRM-Technology-for-Business-Blows-My-Mind.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"578\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466082000,"author_id":362,"chart_url":""}

It figures we&rsquo;d be a tough group to pin down!What&rsquo;s consistent with prior generations &ndash; so far &ndash; is baby boomers&rsquo; intention to retire later than they actually do. Workers say they intend to retire at 65. However, consistently since 1991, the actual median retirement age is 62; 46% retired earlier than planned.<img alt=\"\" height=\"149\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Planning-to-retire.png\" width=\"606\"/><h3> Why the disparity from stated intentions to reality?</h3><li> Health issues/disability (55%)</li><li> Company changes &ndash; downsizing/closure (24%)</li><li> Needing to care for spouse or other family member (17%)</li>Retiring earlier than planned often leads to less confidence they can afford retirement.Those approaching &ldquo;retirement age&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t intend to retire have a wide variety of plans, from working as they are at their current company, to moving to part-time work at their current company or doing something completely different, to striking out on their own as entrepreneurs.<h3> Common Pre-Retirement Concerns</h3>The current economy is highly volatile, and individuals approaching retirement have weathered &ndash; some much better than others &ndash; the multi-year financial crisis. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not surprising there&rsquo;s more than a bit of uncertainty when making important retirement decisions.<strong> Common employment concerns:</strong>1. Will they be able to find jobs that are a good fit, pay well, and value their contributions?a. Per AARP (2), 74% seek work for the additional income2.  How long will it take them to find a job?a. Per AARP (4) on average it takes seven months to find a new job. However, the timeframe varies considerably; 60% within three months, 27% three months to one year; 13% more than a year.3.  Will they face age discrimination when searching for work?a. Per AARP, 64% of workers have seen or personally experienced age discrimination in the workplace.4.  How easily will they be able to work for/with employees who are considerably younger?<h3> Common Financial Concerns</h3><li> Will they be able to work as long as they need to financially?</li><li> Are they prepared financially to meet their needs in retirement?</li><li> How will their health impact both what they do and their ability to pay for healthcare and other expenses in retirement?</li>Employers Efforts to Help Employees Prepare for Retirement3Historically employers have taken little responsibility for helping employees prepare for retirement. Additionally, many only think of retirement as completely leaving the workforce. It&rsquo;s critical for both employers, who need the institutional knowledge, mentoring, knowledge transfer, skills and strong work ethic of baby boomers, and employees who may not want to retire, or aren&rsquo;t financially in a position to retire, to consider a variety of options.Leaders have a unique opportunity to address a number of transitional needs &ndash; in this age of rapid transformation &ndash; through creative use of older employees&rsquo; experience and knowledge.More employers are now making retirement planning tools available. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right thing to do&rdquo; was the reason provided by 85% of employers. And, 80% believe providing tools will increase employee engagement. Examples:Tools, services and communications to improve individuals&rsquo; financial well-being, with many employers allowing retirees use of these programs beyond retirement.Employers are also expressing concern about low dollar figures in &lsquo;near retirees&rsquo; defined contribution accounts. About 75% of employers are working with employees to minimize &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; (primarily loans) from these plans.<h3> Looking Forward</h3>The tremendous uncertainties surrounding retirement and the wide variance in the degree individuals have (and are) prepared/preparing themselves financially for retirement, demonstrates the tremendous need for assistance.Current employees need help to fully understand what steps to take financially and in other areas to confirm they are on track, or create detailed, easily monitored plans to help them attain the best retirement scenario they can.<strong> Employers must play a significant role:</strong><li> Options for a phased transition</li><li> Education in many forms &ndash; initial planning, monitoring, tracking progress</li><li> Easily understood and easy-to-use tools for employees and spouses</li><li> Ongoing communication and tips</li><li> Expertise from retirement planning experts &ndash; online, in-person</li>Action Items:<li> Review your employees&rsquo; internal retirement savings accounts. If you note a large number of loans against these accounts, create both written and in-person methods to communicate to all employees the importance of these savings.

{"original_id":5524,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Concerning Story of Workplace Trust (and How It Can Spiral out of Control)","link":"a-concerning-story-of-workplace-trust-and-how-it-can-spiral-out-of-control","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Trust only goes so far where it pertains to employee and employer. It&rsquo;s not a whole-hearted trust, but more like an &ldquo;I trust you for now&rdquo; sentiment.</p><p> I personally have experienced the strangest culmination of trust issues in the workplace. My issues with one of my employers began at the intersection of trust, insecurity and ambition.</p><p> I was the ambitious employee who saw the possibilities for my career in taking advantage of every educational opportunity this employer had to offer. It seemed reasonable at the time to take advantage and progress myself.</p><p> My relationship with my immediate supervisor started off with trust. She seemed supportive of my growth and in turn I believed she understood my motivation to be an asset to the organization.</p><p> To start my educational buffet, I requested clearance to take part in the company&rsquo;s free offering of HR certification courses through Cornell. I was approved for one certificate to begin with. I enjoyed it so much that I continued to ask for clearance as I decided to pursue four other certifications. Additionally, I applied for the internal management program and was accepted.</p><p> Here is where my trouble began&hellip;                       </p><p> If you read clearly, it seems harmless enough that I was taking advantage of what was available. After all, we create programs like these in HR so that the employees can benefit from them.</p><p> At this time, I had been warned many times over not to trust my immediate supervisor despite her seemingly supportive demeanor. I kept what I knew in my back pocket, but continued to interact with her in our collegial, but jovial manner.</p><p> It was like one of those bright sunny days where the skies quickly turn black anticipating a bad storm. My supervisor just turned on me one day. A hiring manager claimed I didn&rsquo;t send them candidates for a position and so she called me in to discuss. I expected to find the usually supportive supervisor and instead I found someone who didn&rsquo;t care to find out the facts. She had an agenda to berate me - but why?</p><p> She thought I wanted her job.</p><p> My supervisor was the Director of Talent Acquisition, but the role she loved the most was Director of Gossip. She had a penchant for talking about her employees with their co-workers. In her head, she was sharing her thoughts with what seemed like close friends. She even went so far to ask for their confidentiality. Trust was being compromised at every corner of this workplace and no one was all the wiser.</p><p> Eventually, the gossip got back to me and it was about me. I was warned that she berated me that day and it wasn&rsquo;t even a real issue. I was also cautioned that she felt intimidated by me and my ambition. My very benign intention of pursuing what this employer had to offer was seen as an undercover plot to dethrone her and take her job.</p><p> Seven years later it remains somewhat laughable, but this is the epitome of where trust, insecurity, a deviant mind and lack of communication gets a person in trouble. I can write a book about the endless bullying I endured from this woman from that fateful day forward.</p><p> For the purpose of this post let&rsquo;s explore where she went wrong:</p><li> It is never alright to gossip about your employees with their co-workers. In fact, gossip in the workplace is seldom contained. There is no trust where there are juicy office tidbits floating around. It always gets out and it is nothing pretty when it does. Avoid it at all costs.</li><li> When we create training and development programs in HR, it is usually because we understand that a knowledgeable employee is not only an asset to themselves, but for the company as well. Why anyone would take offense to an employee wanting to better themselves is beyond me.</li><li> Let&rsquo;s talk about assumptions. We all know the saying. My supervisor made a lot of assumptions about me without any real proof. She assumed that because I pursued all of those certifications and passed &ndash; that I had a plan to take her job. The reality was I didn&rsquo;t want her job at all. It was a thankless, high-volume output position with very few controls in place for anyone to be successful in it.</li><li> Which brings me to my last insight; she was insecure in her abilities. If she had the decency to have a straightforward conversation with me about my goals &ndash; instead of gossiping - she would have found out that my only goal at that time was to work at one of the site hospitals closer to my home. I needed to be closer to my then infant daughter. Communication saves relationships and reputations.</li><p> Trust is important in any relationship. Workplace relationships are no different. Never assume you know what an employee&rsquo;s intentions are. Actions are half the story, but motivations are internal and not readily visible. Communicate often, address issues and concerns with the pertinent parties and don&rsquo;t discourage the ambitious of the bunch from bettering themselves because of your insecurities. Doing otherwise results in the demise of your own career as a leader. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 16:20:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 16:20:28.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_yNxy8XK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-concerning-story-of-workplace-trust-and-how-it-can-spiral-out-of-control/\", \"post_id\": \"11799\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 16:20:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 16:20:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-concerning-story-of-workplace-trust-and-how-it-can-spiral-out-of-control\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11798\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5750\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/A-Concerning-Story-of-Workplace-Trust-and-How-It-Can-Spiral-out-of-Control.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"385\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466096400,"author_id":212,"chart_url":""}

They meant the ability to understand the technical detail but then zoom out to see it in the context of the big picture (often business context or need).</p><p> Given our theme this month is Database Marketing, that got me thinking about how such an approach helps leaders of these teams.</p><p> What does it mean for a Database Marketing leader to step away from the technical detail &amp; focus on the bigger picture of how to make a real difference in their business?</p><p> Well, I&rsquo;ve been browsing other blogs again &amp; found some content that shares interesting potential answers to that question.</p><h3> Does it matter if it&rsquo;s Offline or Online? <br/>  </h3><p> First, let&rsquo;s start with this post from Tommy Landry, published in CMS Wire. In it, he argues that marketers are in danger of being pedantic and myopic if they obsess about thinking in terms of offline versus online marketing. Your customers don&rsquo;t see you that way &amp; the biggest impact from your database marketing efforts probably comes through integrated marketing anyway. See if you agree with this challenge to step back &amp; look at the big picture:</p><h3> How can your customer be the hero of your story? <br/>  </h3><p> Another key theme that&rsquo;s emerged from a few writers is the need to focus your database marketing efforts back on the customer. We&rsquo;ve posted before on the need to return to customer centricity in all our data, analytics and database marketing plans. Good to read Courtney Feairheller making the same plea on HubSpot&rsquo;s marketing blog. Sound high-level principles here, especially the need for your wider insight work to give real clarity and understanding of your target audience before co-creating interactions:</p><h3> Is culture the elephant in the room? <br/>  </h3><p> As a consultant, all too often you come across clients who want to hear the easier advice but shrink back from addressing thorny cultural issues. So, I was encouraged to see Brian Solis raise this topic in the context of barriers to driving digital transformation. Although our focus is on more customer-centred holistic database marketing, not just going digital with your business, the problem he raises can often be a barrier for insight leaders too. That&rsquo;s why more &amp; more are investing in people change, coaching and culture initiatives, not just data projects. </p><h3> What about you? <br/>  </h3><p> Hope those excerpts were interesting and got you thinking about any &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; context you might be missing. Could you be at risk of just &lsquo;heads down&rsquo; working on technically optimising your database marketing, whilst missing the opportunity to address some wider business barriers to real impact?</p><p> How well are your Database Marketing team joining up with other Insight professionals, marketers &amp; wider business leaders &mdash; to ensure interactions make sense for customers and optimise profit? If you&rsquo;ve any tips to share or &lsquo;war stories&rsquo; of what doesn&rsquo;t work, please do share.</p><p> Taking Database Marketing from being seen as just a part of Marketing or IT, into a driver of transforming your business to interact intelligently with your customers is a long journey for everyone.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 16:54:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 16:54:43.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_Y6uAB1N.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/database-marketing-are-you-missing-the-big-picture/\", \"post_id\": \"11801\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 16:54:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 16:54:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"database-marketing-are-you-missing-the-big-picture\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11800\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5751\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Database-Marketing-Are-You-Missing-the-Big-Picture.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"773\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466092800,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5526,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Let Miscalculation Be the Little Big Horn of Your Exit Planning","link":"dont-let-miscalculation-be-the-little-big-horn-of-your-exit-planning","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In my company&rsquo;s 2014 survey of business owners, we included these two questions: <br/>  </h3><li> When do you want to exit your business?</li><li> What prevents you from planning your exit?</li><p> 75% responded with some version of &ldquo;I have little or no sense of urgency&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not planning until I&rsquo;m ready to exit.&rdquo;</p><p> Like many of these owners you may be thinking, &ldquo;Revenue, cash flow and my profits are all increasing. Why do I need to do anything now? I&rsquo;m not ready to exit. &rdquo;</p><p> And in that, you share the mindset of George Custer on the day before the Battle of The Little Bighorn.</p><p> As you may recall, after a streak of good luck that lead to an abundance of confidence, Lt. Col. Custer was given the task of locating and forcing the Sioux and Cheyenne back to their reservations. But he failed to conduct adequate reconnaissance and consequently enjoyed a false sense of security. He didn&rsquo;t realize what he was facing or, in today&rsquo;s parlance, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know what he didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p> Once the battle was underway, insufficient resources (troops and ammunition) made victory impossible. Custer had not taken the time to determine, before battle, the strength of his adversaries. When he finally did so in the heat of battle, Custer&rsquo;s confidence could not overcome his lack of resources.</p><p> Owner over-confidence, however, lies not in hubris but in &ldquo;not knowing what you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Consequently, owners underestimate what needs to be done to transfer their businesses to the person they choose, when they want, and for the amount of money they need.</p><p> Owner complacency is caused by:</p><li> Underestimating the amount of capital needed to replace today&rsquo;s income.</li><li> Overestimating the net proceeds needed from the sale of the business. (Remember: sale proceeds are reduced by taxes, expenses of sale, and business debt, and may be reduced by earn-out requirements as well.) Your advisors can easily calculate what your net proceeds are likely to be long before any transfer of ownership. Don&rsquo;t assume, as did Custer, that your resources are up to task.</li><li> Assuming that children or key employees want to own the business and can get financing to pay for it.</li><li> Assuming that key employees will remain with the company through the owner&rsquo;s exit&mdash;a necessary condition for a successful sale.</li><p> Let&rsquo;s look at the last of the four: Years ago I met with Mr. and Mrs. Stiles, owners who were interested in selling their business to three key employees. We discussed several possible designs to structure the transfer to the mutual benefit of all parties. They left my office with a promise to weigh their options.</p><p> When I heard from them again two years later, I assumed they had finally decided to begin the design of their Exit Plan. In a sense I was correct, but the exit was not the one we had discussed. As soon as Mrs. Stiles sat down, she blurted, &ldquo;Our three key people quit two weeks ago. Yesterday they opened up shop two blocks away from us. They have taken our best customers and employees with them! We&rsquo;re ruined!&rdquo;</p><p> Mrs. Stiles was right: they were.</p><p> The Stiles had assumed their key employees would stay indefinitely. I learned later that when the Stiles had approached their employees to determine their interest in buying the company, the employees thought the asking price was way too high. They also realized that, to a large extent, they were the business&mdash;not the Stiles. As do many mature owners, the Stiles had been throttling back for years as their employees assumed more responsibility. With nothing to prevent them from doing so, the three employees left and set up a competing shop&mdash;complete with employees and customers, courtesy of the somewhat stupefied Stiles.</p><p> Rarely is a surprise a good one in the course of a business exit, but surprises due to miscalculation and false assumptions can prove deadly.</p><p> How could the Stiles have prevented their key employees from leaving and competing? In my next post we&rsquo;ll discuss non-solicitation agreements designed to prevent key employees from leaving and taking other employees and customers. We take the sting out of the non-solicitation agreement by offering an incentive compensation plan designed to reward key employees for remaining with a company and growing it.</p><p> For now, remember the old adage: It&rsquo;s far better to start planning two years earlier than you think necessary than five minutes too late.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 17:33:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 17:33:24.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_mF88iak.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-let-miscalculation-be-the-little-big-horn-of-your-exit-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"11803\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 17:33:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 17:33:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-let-miscalculation-be-the-little-big-horn-of-your-exit-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11802\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5752\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dont-Let-Miscalculation-Be-the-Little-Big-Horn-of-Your-Exit-Planning.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"668\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466064000,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Conversions and rollovers are not the same as contributions &mdash; contributions are the amount you put in each year out of earned income (max of $5,500 if 49 or under, $6,500 if 50 or older). So if you contributed $5,500 a year for 10 years, you would have $55,000 you could access penalty free in the event of a job loss or other unexpected event.</p><p> There is a second type of Roth offered by many 401(k) plans called a Designated Roth Account that allows you to put more in &mdash; but the 401(k) version of the Roth does not have the same penalty-free access provisions as the Roth IRA. Still, I fund a portion of my 401(k) to my Designated Roth because I know how powerful Roth IRAs are once you are retired.</p><p> Once retired, there is a formula that determines how much of your Social Security is taxable and how much in Medicare Part B premiums you'll pay. If you have a higher income, a larger portion of your Social Security is taxed (up to a maximum of 85% of benefits may be taxable). If your income is high enough, you will pay hundreds more each month for your Medicare Part B premiums. The great thing about the Roth is withdrawals from a Roth don't count in the formula that determines these things. Withdrawals from other retirement accounts like IRAs and regular 401(k)s or 403(b)s do count.</p><p> With liquidity provisions and extra tax benefits later on, the Roth is truly a superhero.</p><h3> <strong>  Wonder Woman </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The HSA is just as powerful, but in a different way. You have to have a high-deductible HSA-qualified health plan to fund an HSA. With the HSA you get a tax deduction for what you contribute (for a single plan max of $3,350 if 49 or under, $4,350 if 55 or older), and you can withdraw the money tax-free at any time for eligible medical expenses (like co-pays, prescriptions and dental work).</p><p> The HSA becomes even more powerful if you fund it each year and let it grow for your retirement years. This means you would pay for health expenses out of pocket, not out of your HSA. Then in retirement, you would have another pot of money that could be used tax-free for health-care expenses. HSA withdrawals don't count in the formulas for Social Security taxation or Medicare Part B either. With her nurturing nature, an HSA is certainly the Wonder Woman of retirement accounts.</p><p> Do everything you can to fund these superheroes each year. They will help make sure you are flying in your retirement years.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-15 17:38:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-15 17:38:07.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_XuNaH1K.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-choosing-a-retirement-account-go-with-superman/\", \"post_id\": \"11806\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-15 17:38:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-15 17:38:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-choosing-a-retirement-account-go-with-superman\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11805\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5754\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/When-Choosing-a-Retirement-Account-Go-with-Superman.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"994\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466085600,"author_id":125,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5528,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Who Are the Buyers Driving This Market?","link":"who-are-the-buyers-driving-this-market","source_link":null,"content":"<p> By Cameron Lilja / Director of Product Development, Nasdaq Global Information Services</p><p> Despite the recent spate of volatility, the stock market has experienced a resounding recovery since the financial crisis of 2008 with major indexes at or near record levels. After such a long, sustained bull market, one might ask, &ldquo;Who are the buyers driving this market?&rdquo;</p><p> The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is that listed companies themselves are among the biggest buyers of stock.</p><h3> <strong>  Where Do Buybacks Come From? </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the process of conducting business and other related activities, companies generate cash; the strategy surrounding its usage is critical for management and investor success.</p><p> Companies can deploy their cash in various ways. One option is to invest in growth opportunities such as research and development, acquisition activity, and general capital expenditures. Another is to return the cash to shareholders via a dividend payment or stock buyback. In the post-crisis economic environment, which has offered fits of uncertainty, companies have increasingly chosen to return their cash to shareholders in lieu of investing in riskier growth-related activities.</p><p> Nasdaq&rsquo;s new  <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/StockBuybacksWhitepaper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  white paper </a>  explores stock buybacks, often referred to as share repurchases, one of the methods for companies to return capital to shareholders. It includes an explanation of stock buyback programs, their benefits to shareholders, recent market trends for companies executing buybacks, and the implication for investors. </p><h3> <strong>  The Mechanics of a Buyback Program </strong></h3><p> <br/> A stock buyback (or share repurchase) occurs when a company purchases shares of its own stock, often in the open market, thereby reducing the number of shares outstanding. A company typically uses cash to fund the purchase, though some companies finance the purchase.</p><p> The decision on whether to finance the purchase or to use cash is based on numerous factors such as the amount of cash the company has in reserve as well as the state of the lending environment, including current interest rates.</p><p> A company starts the buyback process by announcing publicly and to the SEC that it will repurchase shares. The company typically discloses (a) how much stock it intends to repurchase, usually a dollar amount; (b) a timeline for the repurchase, often spanning months or even years; and (c) whether or when it completes any part or all of its repurchase. SEC Rule 10b-18 outlines specific requirements for stock repurchases on the open market including (a) the manner of purchase, which requires that the company purchase from a single broker or dealer on any given day; (b) time and price constraints to ensure fair trading; and (c) volume limitations, prohibiting a company from purchasing more than 25% of its average daily volume on any given day.</p><p> Stock buybacks are one of many transactions that a company can execute on their stock. At the same time that it is repurchasing shares, a company may also be issuing new shares via employee equity grants or stock options. It is often the case that share buyback programs are instituted to specifically offset new stock issuance via such grants or options. As a result, it is possible for a company to issue more shares than it repurchases over a stated buyback period.</p><p> To learn more, please  <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/StockBuybacksWhitepaper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  download the white paper </a> , which fully illustrates the mechanics of stock buyback programs, discusses market trends and how shareholders may benefit, and explains total shares outstanding and excess returns.

Prioritize the most important and then set a budget aside to get the help you need.</p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> In the role as the client, yesterday, I was appalled by the way in which my request was ignored. Salespeople would term this as an &ldquo;objection&rdquo;. I saw an improved route but the vendor refused to listen. On my end, time is of the essence for my project to be completed.</p><p> Ignoring objections and requests is a common error in the sales profession. Many believe if they ignore the issue, it will go away on its own. They cover up the issue by talking over it. This is a huge red flag for the client. The behavior gives indication that the work will most likely not meet expectations. It buries any hope for making a sale.</p><p> A much improved approach is to ask questions as to why the client is making the request. By obtaining clarity, the vendor is able to gain a wider perspective. Once the insight is provided and deemed valid, both parties find an improved path to follow together. The conversation becomes an excellent learning experience.</p><p> From that point forward, new client interactions will prove to flow more easily. By incorporating all of the lessons learned, over time, it becomes almost effortless to build relationships along with a loyal clientele.</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> It is never easy to accept ideas from those who are supposedly looking to you for expert advice.

I can&rsquo;t recommend 99% of the budgeting tools or apps out there to my clients. As a fiduciary, any and all advice must be in my client&rsquo;s best interest. Up until now, the only way to have your spending patterns and investment accounts aggregated was to manually enter the data or give your passwords to a third party like Mint or Yodlee. Despite the convenience, most people don&rsquo;t know that by doing so, they are taking on the risk of loss from their account. That&rsquo;s right, they just got the financial institution off the hook for the security of their account. Why? Because the small print in the service agreements at virtually all the banks and brokerage firms state that if you share your username and passwords, or credentials, with a third party, they are not liable if your account gets hacked. WOW &ndash; Who knew? The regulators are not on top of this one either.</p><p> The best (not just ok) wealth advisors help their clients navigate the opportunities and threats. First, do no harm. That is the starting point, middle and end goal when providing advice.</p><p> So you can imagine my joy at hearing that there is a movement afoot to develop much safer APIs (Application Program Interface) instead. Well hello brave new world! Coming soon, this will be a tremendous improvement for investors who want their advisor to have the 360 degree view of their finances. At last a way to have the convenience and the security. Does your advisor or bank already offer a complete view of your accounts? If so you may want to ask them how they accomplish that. If you need to enter your passwords to pull in your other accounts you are at risk. If you want this advisor&rsquo;s advice? Change your passwords now and wait for the next generation of data aggregation. Are your current advisors, banks or brokerage firms encouraging you to put the safety of your accounts at other institutions at risk? It is a wide spread practice. When I ask the vendors or other advisors about the exposure to their clients&rsquo; accounts, I get one of two answers &ndash; either &ldquo;the convenience justifies the risk&rdquo;, or &ldquo;everyone is doing it so it must be ok&rdquo;. Is that in your best interest? I don&rsquo;t believe you can be a fiduciary and run a firm that way. Bleeding edge and your money? Not on my watch. You deserve better than that when trusting people (not to mention paying them), to help you protect your life savings.

But suddenly everything changed, and our peaceful retreat was turned upside down. My phone rang, and when I answered I was surprised by the panicked voice of my newest client: &ldquo;Get me out of this market George! You have to do something!&rdquo; I had no idea what had happened. I told her I&rsquo;d do some research and call her back right away.</p><p> Of course, if you&rsquo;ve ever visited the  <a href=\"http://www.yellowstonelodge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yellowstone Lodge </a>  (or any lodge in a large nature area), you know my first challenge. The Lodge has intermittent Internet on a good day, and this was anything but that. Just before the market closed that afternoon, the Treasury Department announced they were going to let  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers\" target=\"_blank\">  Lehman Brothers </a>  &ldquo;fail&rdquo;. There would be no bailout. In its last 30 minutes of the day, the market dropped over 150 points. The media started shouting about the panic that would likely hit on Monday since Lehman Brothers wasn&rsquo;t alone&mdash;many banks had problem balance sheets that were just as bad. This was unprecedented in my lifetime, and I knew then we were in for something steeper than even the tallest peak at Yellowstone.</p><p> There was little I could do except return to Denver to be here for my clients who were terrified of what this meant to their life savings and struggling hard to figure out what it meant to them and how to move forward. In less than 8 hours I was at my desk working to find a strategy&mdash;any strategy&mdash;that might be beneficial if and when the predicted panic hit. The one thing I was sure of is that I needed to persuade my clients not to sell. It would be like grabbing for a falling knife.</p><p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession\" target=\"_blank\">  The Great Recession </a>  had its beginning on that day I flew back from Yellowstone. I couldn&rsquo;t fathom then that the downdraft would last until the spring of 2009. Nor could I have predicted that that after hitting bottom at 6443 in March that year that the Dow would double in less than three years. The prognosticators kept predicting lower and lower stock averages even when the Dow was at 6443. Some panicked&mdash;and lost. Those who kept cool heads analyzed the big picture, determined the context and consequence of what was happening, and made careful choices based on the facts. They were the clear winners in the end.</p><p> What happened in those years is a constant reminder to me of how to approach current events&mdash;especially those that paint a potentially ominous picture for the stock market. Will China&rsquo;s economic slowdown throw the US into recession? Are slowing new job numbers powerful enough to throw us off track? Can consumers keep up their spending growth? They&rsquo;re all questions to consider, and in each case we need to take the time to make careful, thoughtful decisions and not fall into the reactionary mindset that the media loves to perpetuate. (For more on that timeless topic, re-read my blog Headlines sell&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let them mislead you!)</p><p> The market is having some expected jitters after last week&rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics report that only 32,000 new jobs were created in May&mdash;nowhere near the expected 150,000 jobs. It&rsquo;s good to note that the Bureau states that number is within 115,000 jobs of possible error. Here&rsquo;s a  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/you-know-almost-nothing-about-the-economy-get-used-to-it-1465235108\" target=\"_blank\">  great article </a>  in the  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/\" target=\"_blank\">  Wall Street Journal </a>  on the huge margin of error&mdash;and frequent revisions&mdash;of payroll and other data. Even so, the important facts to keep in mind are these:</p><li> Job growth inevitably varies significantly from month to month, especially in a recovering economy such as this one.</li><li> In May, despite relatively meager job growth, unemployment decreased by 0.3% to 4.7%. That&rsquo;s 484,000 fewer unemployed.</li><li> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/average-hourly-wage-growth-april-2016-2016-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Wage growth is on the rise </a>  at more than +2.5%.</li><li> Job growth is &ldquo;stronger for longer&rdquo; in this recovery due to the depth of the last recession.</li><li> Job growth will decline as the unemployment rate sinks further and employers struggle to find enough skilled workers to fill available positions.</li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/New-Job-Formation.png\" width=\"480\"/></p><p> Putting these numbers in context is an important piece of the puzzle as well. Some parts of the country, including Colorado Springs and Denver, are reporting a shortage of skilled labor in construction&mdash;a challenge that is holding back major construction projects. Health care, technology, and accounting are just a few examples of fields that have a bright future for jobs. At the same time, non-skilled workers are hurting, and pending minimum wage increases in many states and cities have employers on a mission to automate hourly-wage jobs.</p><p> All of this is important information, but economic growth is still driven primarily by consumer spending&mdash;and spending requires discretionary income that results from an increase in total income. Looking at changes in average or median income is fine, but ultimately it&rsquo;s the change in discretionary income that matters most to the economy.</p><p> No matter how the market reacts to the job numbers&mdash;or changes in interest rates, or China&rsquo;s economy, or the upcoming election&mdash;keeping these individual factors in perspective is key. To keep a cool head, look at the big picture, analyze new information with care, and keep your eye on the big picture. Speaking from experience, it&rsquo;s the easiest (and often the most lucrative) way to take on even the tallest mountains.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 14:51:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 14:51:32.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_qmR6yTm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/analyzing-the-jobs-report-and-other-news-that-doesnt-really-matter/\", \"post_id\": \"11815\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 14:51:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 14:51:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"analyzing-the-jobs-report-and-other-news-that-doesnt-really-matter\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11813\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5758\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Analyzing-the-Jobs-Report-and-Other-News-that-Doesn\\u2019t-Really-Matter.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"507\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466150400,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":5532,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Keys to Unlock Your True Potential","link":"three-keys-to-unlock-your-true-potential","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Lately, to the dismay of my family, friends, and staff, I&rsquo;ve been working when I&rsquo;m not sleeping. I take breaks here and there to eat and exercise. Of course, there are the vicious hide-and-seek bouts with the dogs too.</h3><p> <br/> This weekend, I&rsquo;m using the time to get more work done. This isn&rsquo;t a complaint because it&rsquo;s my choice. This choice got me thinking about priorities and what my work means to  you .</p><p> As I took a quick break, my thoughts ran to what I&rsquo;ve learned over the years and what I consider the most important aspects to success. More importantly, I thought about what I need to do&mdash;or anyone needs to do&mdash;to be supremely happy and successful.</p><p> It boils down to three keys.</p><p> So today, I&rsquo;d like to talk about those three keys to help you get dialed in to living a fulfilled life.</p><h3> <strong>  Share Yourself </strong> . </h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m not speaking of your time or energy. I mean share your story with others. The art of sharing your own story is what connects you to the rest of the world. I don&rsquo;t mean sharing in a selfish, narcissistic way. I mean vulnerably sharing the key transformations in your life, so others can benefit from your experience.</p><p> When you do this, people identify with their own, similar struggles. As you share what you learned and how you were transformed, they benefit from your experience even if they might do it differently.</p><p> The big trick here is to make sure you share how you were transformed. If you don&rsquo;t offer up that most critical lesson, your story is simply a dead end for them from a learning standpoint. What&rsquo;s more, you don&rsquo;t achieve that connection.</p><h3> <strong>  Be Yourself </strong> . </h3><p> <br/> This is what keeps you connected to you. There is no greater struggle than when what you think, say, and do are not in complete harmony.</p><p> Think about those times you felt out of sync or not yourself. What was missing? Likely, it was that congruence.</p><p> Being yourself puts you in the best position to offer your greatest gifts to the world&mdash;whatever they are. It&rsquo;s also the best way to ensure your own happiness and sanity.</p><h3> <strong>  Give Yourself </strong> . </h3><p> <br/> This is what connects you to higher powers. It also, oddly, provides the greatest return.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not speaking of being generous with your money or time. Many people donate those. I&rsquo;m referring to fully giving yourself to your purpose. (See  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/7-signs-you-found-your-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  7 Signs You Found Your Purpose </a>  and  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/figure-purpose-life-fewer-600-words/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How to Figure Out Your Purpose in Life in Fewer Than 600 Words </a> .)</p><p> This starts with contributing your efforts fully to what you&rsquo;re going to do and give to the rest of this world. This is giving everything you have to that calling.</p><p> I&rsquo;d like to spend time on this one because this is what truly unlocks the world for you. Of course, the greatest reward usually requires the greatest sacrifice.</p><p> This will be lonely and painful.</p><p> It&rsquo;ll be lonely because people won&rsquo;t understand you. They won&rsquo;t understand what drives you. They won&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;d want to work so hard.</p><p> It&rsquo;ll be painful because the farther you advance, the less people available in this world who can help you. You&rsquo;re in a territory so few have been. That&rsquo;s why the most brilliant ideas have such lonely childhoods.</p><p> There is a terrible secret no one ever tells you about becoming successful. The greater your successes, the more&mdash;not less&mdash;you need to do by yourself to stay ahead.</p><p> So, when I said &ldquo;this&rdquo; will be lonely and painful, what did I mean by &ldquo;this?&rdquo;</p><p> There are essentially four characteristics:</p><h3> <strong>  Strategy </strong> :</h3><p> You have a strategy for where you&rsquo;re going in life. You seek an understanding of why the world works the way it does in this area. You question everything. You take nothing at face value.</p><h3> <strong>  Mindset </strong> :</h3><p> You maintain a particular mindset. You understand limitations are something of the mind, not the universe.</p><h3> <strong>  Practice </strong> :</h3><p> Once you have your strategy and no-limits mindset in place, you practice to perfection. By practice, I don&rsquo;t mean brute force. Brute force or mindlessly working hard will never overcome intellectual laziness. You practice with an extreme sense of deliberation. You practice your craft well past the point of being able to do it perfectly. You practice it to the point you couldn&rsquo;t possibly make a mistake because you are so dialed in.</p><p> That&rsquo;s the huge difference between someone who&rsquo;s good and someone who&rsquo;s a master at their craft. The good ones take a break when they finally get it right. The greatest ones take a break when they can&rsquo;t possibly get it wrong.</p><h3> <strong>  Discomfort </strong> :</h3><p> You seem to live in a continual state of discomfort. Of course, I&rsquo;m not talking about living in pain, but continually pushing yourself so that every day you&rsquo;re a bit uncomfortable because you&rsquo;re constantly trying new activities and undertaking new projects that progress you. You embrace this discomfort because you know it will make you a great pioneer.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a quick example:</p><p> If you want to be a great salesman of whatever your product is, you don&rsquo;t simply learn how to sell that product or service. Most people can do that.</p><p> No, you&rsquo;re giving yourself to your purpose and your trade.</p><li> You learn the sales techniques.</li><li> You learn the psychology behind why people do what they do or buy what they buy.</li><li> You use the products so you see can see them in practice.</li><li> You break &lsquo;em on purpose to see what people struggle with.</li><li> You become empathetic for those customers.</li><li> You go back to the design teams to show them what&rsquo;s happening.</li><li> You learn everything there is to know about your product&rsquo;s industry.</li><li> You learn everything there is to know about the customers.</li><li> You become an industry&ndash;leading expert on the products, topics, and trend.</li><li> You become a pioneer to advance your industry and the world. <br/>  </li><p> This evolution it what truly unlocks the world to release it&rsquo;s greatest gifts and allows you to give your greatest gifts to others.</p><p> To recap:</p><li> Share yourself. This is what connects you to others.</li><li> Be yourself. This is what keeps you connected to you and keeps you the best you.</li><li> Give yourself. Give yourself to your purpose by going well beyond the basics because that&rsquo;s what unlocks the greatest gifts.</li>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-06-16 15:14:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-06-16 15:14:15.000000","image_url":"2016/6/article_placeholder_gNC7uaH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-keys-to-unlock-your-true-potential/\", \"post_id\": \"11817\", \"post_date\": \"2016-06-16 15:14:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-06-16 15:14:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-keys-to-unlock-your-true-potential\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"11816\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"5759\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Three-Keys-to-Unlock-Your-True-Potential.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"586\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/03/implement-now-2016-how-to-curate/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"should-we-use-robo-advisors-i-dont-know-lets-ask-siri\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1466179200,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
