    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasdunnuk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tommodunn  </a> </u> So.. We have established that this article might not be that interesting to you unless you have clocked more than 400 hours of Steam game-play and have a vitamin D deficiency. However, my nerdy brain can&rsquo;t help but compare my life with the lives of the survivors in the post apocalyptic world of <a href=\"http://www.l4d.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>    Left 4 Dead  </u> </a> .For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the game it basically involves a team of zombie-slaying survivors banding together with the common goal of reaching a safe zone. Now, with the turbulent world of business start-ups we all want to achieve certain goals but there are countless obstacles in our way much like the swarm of blood-crazed zombies in L4D. Fair enough, most obstacles in the startup world don&rsquo;t threaten us with mutilation or death but there are some dangerous threats out there. Also just to make it clear, I don&rsquo;t condone the use of armed force towards other businesses (just in case).This list outlines some of the nastier undead threats to your startup in more detail: <strong>  The Jockey </strong> In L4D this little bastard creeps up on you and jumps onto your shoulders to steer you away from safety. In the start-up world this guy represents the loss of focus that start-ups sometimes face when trying to reach a goal. It can be real easy to start playing with new products and features before you have succeeded with your core product. A friend of mine would often scream in rage when I deviated from the safety of the path to look for &lsquo;fancier&rsquo; weapons.This sheds light on one of my biggest personal challenges. I often found myself running before I could properly walk which sometimes led to a burn-out or an unexplained result. Working on a new project would often get me extremely excited and I didn&rsquo;t have the patience to carefully plan, execute and evaluate my actions. I think that having a co-founder, friend or colleague with a logical and realistic approach is always handy here. <img alt=\"\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1_1.jpg\" width=\"600\"/> <strong>  The Tank </strong> This one kinda explains itself. When you are a small little team working 14 hour days on the next big thing. The last thing you want is Google or Microsoft launching a similar product and SMASHING your hopes and aspirations to hell. Can&rsquo;t really compete can you? Well history has proved this to be wrong in some cases and I can&rsquo;t think of a better example than <a href=\"http://instagram.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Instagram  </u> </a> . These guys launched a photo editing app that  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook  </a> </u>  soon tried to replicate. With all of Facebook&rsquo;s resources they couldn&rsquo;t make a dent in the market because it wasn&rsquo;t what made Facebook &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo;. It was only ever a side product for them whilst Instagram concentrated purely on delivering a top notch photo application. I think that Tanks can be overrated (unless you run out of Shotgun shells). <img alt=\"\" height=\"176\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2_8.png\" width=\"200\"/> <strong>  The Witch </strong> This is where it gets nasty. The first time I came across one of these on L4D I almost soiled myself in terror. You start hearing a disturbing moaning sound and if you come across her it&rsquo;s basically life or death depending on how you deal with her. She incapacitates players instantly if startled and she is bloody fast!I think that the witch represents major unforeseen events like long downtime, hackings and PR scandals. We have seen so many cases of this recently in the press and it is interesting to see how companies respond. I believe that stakeholders appreciate honesty and transparency above all else when shit hits the fan. <img alt=\"\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3_5.png\" width=\"300\"/> <strong>  The Smoker </strong> Arguably one of the most annoying monsters on L4D. This guy lurks in the shadows and when you are least expecting it, drags you away from safety. What is more peculiar is that he does this with his HUGE tongue and starts to suffocate you (much like a boa constrictor).The Smoker represents the nitty-gritty world of tax, law and intellectual property. When you are a small startup it can be so easy to forget about the &lsquo;official stuff&rsquo; but you have to do it. Even if you are taking a few hundred pounds a week in revenue or are living off investment you have to account for everything or the tax man WILL slay you. We are serious guys. Happened to a lovely tech start-up down the road.When it comes to intellectual property I think that in some cases it makes sense to protect a product somehow or another. I do find however that it can be frustrating and uncomfortable when someone cannot discuss their idea with you &lsquo;in case someone steals it&rsquo;. I have always benefited from amazing advice when sharing new ideas and I believe that we are only as good as the people around us. I think that we started to think about these values at  <u>  ideasprout </u>  (an incredibly fun failed venture) and I now value transparency as one of the most important parts of my life. <img alt=\"\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4_4.png\" width=\"200\"/> I think to say that the start-up world is one big game. By this I don&rsquo;t mean that you should take it lightly. I just think that you should always be ready to adapt seamlessly, experiment lots and embrace failure. If you are running down a dark corridor alone on L4D then you are most likely going to get your head torn off but you need to learn this lesson the hard way. I find that it is so similar to the start-up world and I find myself making mistakes like this all the time.I have failed with 3 ventures in the past but every time it happens I learn so much and it has been amazing fun. I recently left  <u>  <a href=\"/category/grow/entrepreneurs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Static  </a> </u>  to pursue a wonderful opportunity working for  <u>  <a href=\"https://bufferapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buffer  </a> </u>  and I am loving the &lsquo;Bootcamp&rsquo; stage!I am really enjoying life after university and as much as I love a good zombie shooter, I hope that rabies never becomes airborne. </p>",

    "title": "Foreign Currency \"Headwinds\" a Mere Flesh Wound for Corporate Earnings",
    "link": "foreign-currency-headwinds-a-mere-flesh-wound-for-corporate-earnings",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If &ldquo;headwinds&rdquo; was not already a hackneyed term in the lexicon of corporate America&rsquo;s leaders, after six weeks of earnings announcements sullied by the recent strength of the U.S. dollar, it now surely is. 3M CEO Igne Thulin called the greenback&rsquo;s comparatively high purchasing power a &ldquo;tough headwind,&rdquo; as U.S. products became more expensive abroad. Delta Air Lines President Ed Bastian remarked that &ldquo;headwinds from the dollar strength&rdquo; in their international segment were offset by stronger domestic market demand. &ldquo;Currency and acreage headwinds&rdquo; remain in 2015, Monsanto COO Brett Bergman told analysts on his company&rsquo;s earnings call. Along with intense competition, American Express CFO Jeff Campbell listed &ldquo;foreign exchange headwinds&rdquo; and lower expected domestic growth as ongoing challenges. Several corporates, including UPS, an SNWAM portfolio holding, provided earnings on a &ldquo;currency-neutral&rdquo; basis to reassure (or to convince) investors that they were, in fact, still growing. CEOs collectively argued that the effects of the currency headwinds were a &ldquo;financial reporting issue rather than an economic event,&rdquo; as Aflac&rsquo;s (another SNWAM portfolio holding) CEO explained in a press release. It is unusual, he argued, for corporates to repatriate the money they earn abroad (the question of why is a topic for another article, but a big reason, presumably, is tax). Since the dollar began its surge around the middle of last year, it is now 15% stronger versus a basket of other major world currencies. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Corporate Master Index has nearly kept up, rising 11% over the same period. So, by this metric, a stronger dollar does appear to be merely a flesh wound.</p><p> A headwind for one company is necessarily a tailwind for another&mdash;take Toyota, for example. The weak Japanese Yen is helping generate a record number of sport utility vehicle sales in the U.S., creating a somewhat unexpected windfall for the automaker. Toyota now ships more autos to the U.S. than the next three largest Japanese automakers combined, Bloomberg noted recently, due to its increased focus on larger vehicles. A stronger dollar and correspondingly weak Euro is also benefitting companies in Europe. Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical firm, said that every 1% drop in the value of the Euro &ldquo;should add 0.5% to earnings per share,&rdquo; The Economist reported in late January. The question remains whether the aforementioned flesh wound will become more serious. At least one economist argues no. Writing for Project Syndicate, Barry Eichengreen of U.C. Berkeley contends in his article &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Bet On A Stronger Dollar&rdquo; that the market is already baking in all the factors (including superior U.S. economic growth, low unemployment, strong consumer sentiment and European and Japanese quantitative easing) that could sustain or make the dollar incrementally stronger. If labor participation, a better indicator of labor market conditions, Eichengreen says, rises, which he thinks is possible, wage pressure could drop, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later than expected, a scenario that would not support further demand for U.S. currency.</p><p> As events play out, SNWAM portfolio holdings with international exposure may experience a temporary sting to their reported &ndash; keyword &ldquo;reported&rdquo; &ndash; bottom lines due to currency fluctuations, but we expect the overall quality of corporate credit to continue improving. </p><p> Sources: Project Syndicate, BAML Indices, Bloomberg, The Economist, company filings, SNWAM Research</p>",

    "title": "Generous Enterprises: The 21st Century's Greatest Companies",
    "link": "generous-enterprises-the-21st-centurys-greatest-companies",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  More and more, I&rsquo;m absolutely convinced that the future belongs to generous enterprises. </strong> Generous enterprises are more concerned about what they give. Generous enterprises understand that if they&rsquo;re motivated by a genuine commitment to serve, and execute in alignment with that intention, the &ldquo;getting&rdquo; will take care of itself.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at two companies that recently either embraced or rejected the generous enterprise concept. I&rsquo;ll start with the rejection&hellip;</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you remember the massive car recalls due to faulty ignition switches affecting millions of GM cars worldwide. These faulty switches were installed over the period of many years. So far, the number of people killed as a direct result of an ignition failure is somewhere between GM&rsquo;s official total of 57 and the several hundred more claims for death that are under review.</p><p> During investigations and hearings following the recalls, it was learned that GM knew the parts weren&rsquo;t up to safety standards for as many as ten years up to 2014 when the recalls began to be announced.</p><p> Now this is still playing out and I don&rsquo;t want to get hung up on the particulars of the situation, except to point out that GM has since reorganized and is now under different leadership. But I do want to take a closer look at how a company like GM could behave so selfishly when it appears that people there were aware of a defect with deadly implications for the people who drove their cars.</p><p> <strong>  For most of us, thank heavens, the outcomes of organizational selfishness are much more benign. </strong> If we hold on to information or fail to consider our customers&rsquo; experiences, no one&rsquo;s going to get hurt. At the same time, however, GM&rsquo;s experience has something to teach us all about the dangers of running an organization where people can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t call attention to problems affecting the customer.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t believe that anyone at GM was indifferent to the people who might be harmed if their ignition failed. The problem was with the system and leadership: GM was a bloated bureaucracy with a blind obsession with &ldquo;hitting the numbers&rdquo;. At a company like this, the safer thing for an employee of GM to do was to ignore or deny the problem. The results as we now know, have been tragic.</p><p> GM had gotten too far away from its customers. This is a phenomenon that can affect businesses of every size. How many of you have ever been at a store where the sales staff was so busy talking to one another that they didn&rsquo;t have time for you? Have you ever walked into a quick serve restaurant where the person taking your order doesn&rsquo;t even make eye contact, let alone welcome you or thank you for your business?</p><p> What about professional services companies that send you, their &ldquo;valued client&rdquo; generic form letters, an egregious shortcoming in a world where Amazon knows me well enough to greet me by name and make suggestions that are actually relevant to me.</p><p> <strong>  That leads me to the next scenario, what I call Generous Enterprises. </strong> You may have heard of a company called DPR Construction. They are a Silicon Valley based construction firm specializing in high tech projects. DPR is number 10 on Fortune Magazine&rsquo;s Best Places to Work list, and their business is thriving!</p><p> When polled, 97-99% of DPR&rsquo;s employees said that DPR offered great challenges, Great bosses, Great Communication, Great Pride and Great atmosphere.</p><p> <strong>  Take another look at the second to the last item &ndash; Great Pride. </strong> That is a particularly telling quality at generous enterprises, and one that can be difficult to achieve in today&rsquo;s highly fragmented and specialized workplaces. How many of us or our employees can say we are proud of our own work let alone the work our company does. </p><p> But here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;I think every business has the opportunity to take pride in its mission and its achievements. I also think everyone can and should share in that pride. And be motivated by that pride to create great experiences for customers.</p><p> DPR offers a great example: When a construction crew of more than 1,400 people put in more than 2.5 million hours on a 450,000-square-foot biotech manufacturing facility expansion project without a single, lost-time safety accident, DPR hosted a BBQ at the site, and invited a cancer patient who would benefit from the drugs to be manufactured at the plant to speak to them. See, it didn&rsquo;t matter if you were pouring concrete or framing walls, you were a part of making life better for that cancer patient.</p><p> The same is true whether you and your employees are serving food, processing drivers&rsquo; licenses, preparing taxes, fabricating steel, or malting barley. Generous enterprises value their people above all, and they include them in the important business of making a difference for their customers, whether that difference is everyday or profound.</p><p> My goal here is to make a sound business case for the Generous Enterprise, and I hope I&rsquo;ve done that. I want to conclude by offering some suggestions for how to make your company more generous.</p><p> <strong>  Be transparent. </strong></p><p> DPR employees reported that their company had great communications. In fact most of the country&rsquo;s best places to work have high marks for communication. Communication is the secret ingredient that transforms employees into stakeholders, people who are invested in the company&rsquo;s mission and success. Companies that are great at communications observe the following principles:</p><li> It&rsquo;s never one-and-done. Often, management has talked about a policy change so thoroughly and for so long that by the time it starts affecting people, they&rsquo;re tired of thinking about it. In these circumstances, it&rsquo;s tempting to send out a quick email and call it good. Well, it&rsquo;s not. Anytime these companies do something at all important, how they communicate it &ndash; through what channels and over what period of time is as important as the change itself.</li><li> It&rsquo;s not one way. Generous enterprises know their employees have a lot to add. Whether it&rsquo;s regular sessions between leadership and rank and file employees, open door policies (and I mean really open), suggestion boxes, you name it. Employee participation is valued and promoted.</li><li> It&rsquo;s principles based &ndash; I&rsquo;m a big believer in the power of stories. A company&rsquo;s story: why it was created. Who it exists to serve, its values and aspirations. Knowing your story and making your people an important part of it is the best way to ensure that what you say aligns with what you do. You know, walking the talk. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Set high expectations. </strong></p><p> <strong>  People by nature love a challenge. </strong> There are few things in life more gratifying than accomplishing something you &ndash; and others &ndash; didn&rsquo;t think you could do. Generous enterprises challenge their employees while giving them the tools and support they need to succeed. Further, they work with employees to understand where their interests lie and lay out a career path.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t stop at a paycheck. </strong> A competitive wage is considered by some companies to be recognition enough. And that may have been true at a lot of places for the last 5 or 6 years, with a lot of good people looking for work. But now that the economy is back on its feet and the labor market is tightening up, it&rsquo;s not.</p><p> <strong>  Generous companies always have always known that the health and happiness of their employees was about much more than just pay and benefits. </strong> And I don&rsquo;t mean you have to go crazy, breaking the bank to offer the kinds of perks Google and other companies are famous for.</p><p> You know your culture and your budget. <strong>  Find ways to reward your people for great performance </strong> , whether it&rsquo;s a Starbucks gift card or a weekend to Las Vegas, and then work like crazy to give out a lot of awards. This is not a zero sum proposition. The great work you&rsquo;re promoting will more than pay for the rewards.</p><p> <strong>  Generous enterprises are perfectly positioned for the 21st century economy. </strong> An economy where the consumer is king, where social media can create superstars and wreak havoc on reputations in a few short hours.</p><p> <strong>  Generous enterprises get and keep the best people, take great care of their customers and stand out in an insanely competitive marketplace. </strong> If your company is generous, congratulations. You&rsquo;re in the right place at the right time. If not, you can get there. Make the decision and get started. It will pay off in ways you can&rsquo;t begin to imagine.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/108897242618977470844/posts?rel=author\" target=\"_blank\">   Andrew Lisa  </a> </u></p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.mediashower.com/content?Action=tp&amp;cid=21356\"/> Once reserved only for the biggest companies with the most resources, big data is now wildly popular even with small and mid-sized businesses. A loosely defined concept that deals with the collection and analysis of massive data sets, big data initiatives are exactly what the name implies. By using customer data as the tea leaves by which future customer behavior can be predicted, big data is removing emotion, hunches and gut instinct from the sales process.</p><p> <strong>  Big Data Takes Guesswork and Emotion Out of Sales and Marketing </strong></p><p> As discussed in the article \" <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.syncsort.com/2015/01/big-data-demystifying-marketing-industry/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Is Big Data Demystifying the Marketing Industry?  </a> </u> ,\" businesses no longer have to pray for a \"flash of brilliance\" from someone on their marketing team. Instead, they gather and analyze big data to gain actionable information about their current and potential customers. Big data takes the guesswork out of marketing by helping customers predict who their most likely potential customers are. It also enables companies to help predict when those people are ready to make a purchase by identifying markers that indicate when a person is doing more than just browsing.</p><p> <strong>  Big Data Can Identify Shopping and Searching Patterns </strong></p><p> Big data initiatives can help even smaller businesses better understand how their customers search and how they shop. Some customers may do all or most of their shopping on mobile devices, others may shop in physical stores, but in conjunction with mobile-only deals and coupons. Some buyers swamp review sites and blogs before they buy, while others conduct simple Google searches. This information is crucial because it helps businesses target the right platforms with the right ads and promotions, all while helping them prevent wasting money on campaigns that aren't relevant to their customers' habits.</p><p> <strong>  Big Data Can Predict Companion Purchases </strong></p><p> Everyone who has ever shopped on Amazon or watched a documentary on Netflix understands the power of if-you-liked-this-then-you-might-like-this marketing. Suggested companion purchases are an excellent way to turn one purchase into two. Big data is the driving force behind this strategy. For businesses, this means beefed up landing pages and confirmation pages that entice customers into considering products or services that they are likely to already be considering.</p><p> The concept of big data has empowered airlines, oil companies and government entities. But no industry has benefited more from big data than marketing and sales. The sheer volume of data created by customers and buyers has become a product in and of itself. Collecting that data, analyzing and understanding it has become the skill that lets businesses take the guesswork out of selling.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/108897242618977470844/posts?rel=author\" target=\"_blank\">   Andrew Lisa  </a> </u>  is a freelance marketing writer.

    "content": "<p> Last year, I plunked down $2,000 for a digital course. I didn&rsquo;t spend months agonizing over the price point, wringing my hands wondering if it would work for me. I read the expert&rsquo;s materials, watched his videos, tried his free advice (it worked beautifully), and signed on the dotted line.</p><p> <strong>  My reasoning: If the &ldquo;free&rdquo; client experience was that good, imagine what was behind the pay wall? </strong></p><p> Best $2,000 I ever spent. Why? Because my experience lined up EXACTLY to what he&rsquo;d led me to believe was possible. From what was delivered, to how it was presented, to the support team, the entire adventure was 100% on-brand. He earned massive amounts of goodwill (and a true fan) and I will look kindly on anything he offers in the future.</p><p> Contrast that with a second expert authority interaction that started out much the same. Some pretty amazing (free) content was shared, followed by a sales offer. The problem? The initial offer was disguised&mdash;and then quickly revealed as a bait and switch. Classic sleazy marketing. And so, &ldquo;expert&rdquo; though she may be, I quickly disconnected from her sphere&mdash;who wants to listen to, much less buy from, a demonstrated liar?</p><p> Because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s expert in your field if you can&rsquo;t create irresistible client and buyer experiences.</p><p> Experiences that you uniquely design to pull in and mesmerize your sweet-spot clients. From the first impression you make, to your first sale, to every single spot on the continuum of your relationship.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s true on-line and it&rsquo;s true face to face. </strong></p><p> <strong>  We buy from those we know, like and trust. </strong> And part of that is being able to consistently rely on what we&rsquo;ll receive from you.</p><p> We appreciate getting what we expect, what we were promised. And we LOVE being delighted. It makes us forgive the inevitable missteps along the way if you&rsquo;re honest and say you&rsquo;re sorry.</p><p> If you keep to the implied promise you made when we first engaged with you, we will be loyal. We&rsquo;ll cheer for you. We&rsquo;ll tell our friends about you. We may even become your stark raving fans (not to mention your unpaid marketing force).</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter if your price point is a $10 book, a $2,000 training course or a $50,000 engagement. <strong>  Creating magnetic client and buyer experiences is about making us feel everything you&rsquo;ve promised us. </strong></p><p> So by all means&mdash;aim high. Just don&rsquo;t forget to deliver.</p>",

    "link": "video-is-the-fintech-bubble-about-to-burst",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "For those who can&rsquo;t watch it (the video), the question I asked is whether there&rsquo;s a Fintech bubble and is it about to burst.  With $12.7 billion raised for over 1,000 start-ups in the past five years, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of people buzzing around this market and some say a further $20 billion is going to be invested in just this year alone.<strong> What&rsquo;s going on?</strong>Well what is happening is a re-architecting of financial services with technology.  Today, it is the integration of technology with money; the digitalisation of money; and the move from local to global exchange.  That&rsquo;s what I blog about every day but my claim in the video is that this is just what we&rsquo;re talking about today, and it&rsquo;s a transitory moment as the picture long-term is far bigger.  It is far bigger because we are completely rethinking how we exchange value.  It is why bitcoin is a big deal, because that is the most likely form of the digitalisation of money.  It is far bigger because the old bank model of the physical distribution of paper in a physical network is turned on its head when we are moving to the digital distribution of data in a global network.Our world has changed thanks to the internet, and the most likely outcome is a new value exchange ecosystem of value tokens, value exchanges and value stores.  I&rsquo;ll blog more about that another day but, meantime, this explains why (a) there is no Fintech bubble and therefore (b) it will not burst.There&rsquo;s no Fintech bubble because we&rsquo;re re-architecting our world to digitise value exchange.  This will therefore morph our world into something different and new.  It is not until the different and new is finished that any bubble will burst.  For example, it is noteworthy that we talk about the internet bubble and burst of the 1990s, and yet we should note that the internet bubble burst in 2001 and then came back because we moved from Net 1.0 to Net 2.0.  As <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/02/the-most-likely-future-for-cryptocurrencies.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> I&rsquo;m saying </a>we have another five generations of internet to go yet, there&rsquo;s no bubble here.  Just a rise and fall of innovation as we move through the internet age.That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s no Fintech bubble bursting.  Just a re-architecting of finance through technology that, until it finishes, will see us moving through waves of innovation and change.",

I&rsquo;m in the Office so I find an empty meeting room to take the call and answer.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s a recruiter. </strong> He goes through the usual story. Would you be interested in Company ABC.  Pre-IPO, all the sales people are making more many than they can spend (I exaggerate but any sales person will know the drill). (Why is it that Head Hunters sound like a broken record? Maybe another Blog for another day?)</p><p> Now, I need to say that I&rsquo;m not looking for a new role, but anybody like myself, who is &ldquo;out there&rdquo; will get these calls from time to time.</p><p> Back to the call.  I ask the name of the company the recruiter is working for and (as I&rsquo;ve got my headset on) type it into Google.  Find that one of their Execs has been arrested for a minor offense (it happens) and go to their website.  Don&rsquo;t really understand the messages on the website, so I ask the Recruiter.  &ldquo;What does &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a global strategic consulting firm that specializes in helping companies solve their strategy execution challenges through a suite of integrated services.&rdquo; mean?.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a direct quote from the website.  Then wish I&rsquo;d hadn&rsquo;t, as he struggles to explain.</p><p> On reading such a company (not customer) focused piece of jargon filled rubbish, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I don&rsquo;t want to work there.  With him still struggling to give me an explanation, it gives me time to check them out on LinkedIn.</p><p> Great, I have a contact who works there, which would have been great, as I would have spoken to him, had I decided to have taken it further.</p><p> I now look at the LinkedIn profiles of the people who are second degree away and it&rsquo;s all very uninspiring.</p><p> I politely turn down the approach from the Recruiter.</p><p> Now, I&rsquo;m not having a go at this company, I&rsquo;m sure they are well meaning managers and probably have an amazing product.  <strong>  But in their search for talent, they are dead in the water. </strong></p><p> So while if you are in Human Resources or a recruiter and reading this, I would agree that maybe &ldquo;Social Selling&rdquo; is right for you.  But maybe an &ldquo;Employee Advocacy&rdquo; program is.</p><p> <strong>  As I hopefully demonstrated through that call I had with the recruiter, your website and your employees LinkedIn profiles are an extension of your brand. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Finally </strong></p><p> Two great friends of mine @StandardofTrust and  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ronmci\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @ronmci  </u>     </a> posted this article on Facebook this morning, quoting the following statistic &ldquo;7 out of 10 employees are disengaged and 1 out of 10 are actively sabotaging their employer.&ldquo;</p><p> Now I&rsquo;m in no position to argue with that, I just hope it isn&rsquo;t true!</p><p> Should Employees Be Encouraged to Tweet?  <u>  <a href=\"http://mitsmr.com/1E1K9Dp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://mitsmr.com/1E1K9Dp  </a> </u>  via @mitsmr</p><p>  </p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  There isn&rsquo;t a minute that goes by in which someone isn&rsquo;t checking a social media platform </strong> &ndash; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.</p><p> And it should not be surprising based on some recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.benzinga.com/general/education/15/02/5284283/staggering-user-statistics-for-10-top-social-media-platforms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   user statistics  </a> </u>  showing Facebook with 1.3 billion monthly active users, Twitter at 288 million monthly active users, Instagram picturing in 300 million users, and LinkedIn connecting roughly 347 million users.</p><p> With most of the social media platforms, if someone begins to follow or requests to follow you, a notification is provided to you. I assimilate this notification as a notion of acceptance or being picked to join the cool kids&rsquo; dodge ball team (it&rsquo;s always nice to feel wanted, right?).</p><p> <strong>  With the initial connection, there are typically some short immediate conversations. </strong> Over time, these conversations will more than likely dissipate over time and the interaction turns to monitoring/viewing from afar, unless you are close friends.</p><p> With distant engagements occurring more and more through social media, there should be no surprise in the number of friends drops that are taking place. As such, being cut from the cool kids&rsquo; group will essentially evoke two emotions: dismay or indifference.</p><p> If I look at myself, I have a tendency to fall into the indifference category because I am one of those people who will drop someone from my friend list without warning. Therefore it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that when someone drops me, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt my feelings.</p><p> I have been asked many times about why I would drop someone without warning and why I wouldn&rsquo;t just unfollow the person. Or better yet, how can you do that? My response: if I am willing to unfollow them so I do not see their content, then what is the point of still remaining their friend? To make them still feel like we are connected and friends? Screw that.</p><p> Nine times out of ten, anyone I drop we usually do not speak regularly anyways. We connected because we happened to be in the same professional industry, know a handful of the same people, and then one of us initiated the friend request to connect.</p><p> <strong>  Given the amount of information we face each and every single day, I have a choice as to what I want to be presented with. If the content or the relationship/interaction doesn&rsquo;t meet my expectations, I move on to people, topics, ideas, and thoughts that benefit me to help others and myself. </strong></p><p> Now, not everyone is able to take the route of indifference when defriending someone on a social media platform and dealing with the after effect. <strong>  In fact, a   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.today.com/money/unfriend-someone-facebook-they-may-unfriend-you-back-real-life-1B8244013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    recent study   </a>  </u>   shows that 50% of people who were unfriended would avoid the person who defriended them in real life. </strong> No surprise there &ndash; occurs all the time with face-to-face relationships. However, my pushback to anyone who has an issue with someone defriending them whether online or face-to-face: if it is that big of a deal for you, why is it a big deal for you?</p><p> Situations like these are perfect for self-reflection and opportunities to explore some of the questions below:</p><li> Is the relationship you lost that impactful?</li><li> How often do you speak with the person?</li><li> Would you consider the person a friend or an acquaintance?</li><li> What did you get from the relationship and on the flip side, what did you give?</li><li> Why do you care that you were unfriended?</li><li> Is the emotion you are feeling because you truly care or that you feel unpopular? <br/>  </li><p> Depending upon your answers, you may realize you don&rsquo;t give a shit; or, that you really want to explore how you can mend the relationship.</p><p> One thing I will note, is <strong>  if the situation is one where there is a working relationship (meaning you work with the person each day), then the costs of the defriending are much higher. </strong> Meaning, regardless of your answers to the questions above, it is necessary to provide some mending to ensure professionalism and work can continue to get completed. You don&rsquo;t have to be friends, but you do have to ensure work is not disrupted. Furthermore, let this be a learning lesson that just because you work together doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be friends on every social media platform out there.</p><p> When you provide channels for someone to know everything about you that you normally wouldn&rsquo;t discuss face-to-face, then you cannot get upset when someone judges you for it.</p><p> <strong>  So here is my advice:  </strong> don&rsquo;t worry about being in the popular crowd and feeling you have to be friends with everyone. Understand why you would want to be friends with the person and know what you can give and get from the relationship. It is no different than creating friendships face-to-face.</p><p> <strong>  Remember, we get what we want by following our true selves and not everyone else.  </strong></p>",

One man reported that his wife &ldquo;is not interested in investing,&rdquo; and another said &ldquo;all my wife cares about is if we&rsquo;re going to have the money.&rdquo;</p><p> A San Francisco man volunteered this worst-case scenario: <strong>  &ldquo;If I were to get hit by BART on the way home, she would be clueless about what to do with whatsoever there is or how to handle anything.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Hearts &amp; Wallets cofounder Laura Varas calls it the issue of the &ldquo;uninvolved spouse.&rdquo; In a new analysis of its 2013 survey data on 5,400 US households, the financial research firm found that 80 percent of these uninvolved spouses are wives among couples approaching retirement age. The good news is that younger wives are more engaged, Varas said. In early- and mid-career couples, fewer than 60 percent of uninvolved spouses were women.</p><p> Yet it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how anyone can avoid this conversation, given the myriad issues to resolve: Will you stagger your retirement dates, especially if your ages are far apart? If saving and paying off the mortgage are twin retirement goals, are you both still contributing enough to your 401(k)s to ensure you get the full employer match?

    "content": "<p> I recently had a conversation with a client who&rsquo;s spent a great deal of time running from her feelings. Not in a &ldquo;let me drown them in booze/Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s/boyfriends\" kinda way.</p><p> She&rsquo;s smart. <br/> Too smart, in fact. <br/> So smart, that she can outsmart herself.</p><p> &ldquo;Amita, I just don&rsquo;t have time to eat well. I&rsquo;m too busy with my kids, career, being amazing.&rdquo; (Yes, I edited in that last part, but it went something like that anyway)</p><p> After a long list of seemingly sensible excuses. I said:</p><p> &ldquo;Wow! It sounds like you&rsquo;re super busy. Maybe you&rsquo;re just too busy to be human.&rdquo;</p><p> Client: &ldquo;Well, why would I want to be human when I can be better than a human? If I don&rsquo;t do all those things and I just sat around and &lsquo;felt things&rsquo; nothing would get done.&rdquo;</p><p> Me: &ldquo;If you think emotions are a poor use of your time. I have 2 things to tell you:  <br/> 1) Your time management skills suck. <br/> 2) We need to teach you how to feel things gently.&rdquo;</p><p> (I should note that I&rsquo;m usually not this blunt with clients. But as Blogs require brevity, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing.)</p><p> Many of us have developed intricate coping mechanisms. Ones that might not cause devastation, but keep us stagnant, nonetheless. Often the fear that we will collapse under the weight of an emotion keeps us &ldquo;busy&rdquo; with other things. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love a good distraction. I just checked my phone twice while writing this post. But let&rsquo;s do a short-term/long-term cost-benefit analysis of not feeling emotions:</p><li> Short-term impact of not feeling emotions-Awesome! Don&rsquo;t have to feel icky, sad, or scared.</li><li> Long-term impact of not feeling emotions- No Bueno. Results in self-sabotage, poor decisions, and anxiety. <br/>  </li><p> The good news is that you don&rsquo;t have to stay in bed for a week and cry. You can feel things gently.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s How:</p><li> <strong>  Notice it.  </strong> Bring your awareness off of your iPhone and to yourself. Are you feeling discomfort? Don&rsquo;t worry about the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; just notice it.</li><li> <strong>  Name it. </strong>  So often we lump emotions into one big bag of crap. Take time to differentiate them. For example, before a big work meeting you might feel &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; Break that down into parts. Is it anxiety? Is it nervousness? Is it excitement?</li><li> <strong>  Accept it. </strong>  It seems contradictory, but feeling an emotion actually helps to process it out of you. Notice it and allow it to pass through you, flowing like a river. You don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;fix&rdquo; anything, just feel it. Often, we jump straight to a distraction or solution to make the feeling stop. By avoiding the feeling, it gets backed up in us  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/how-to-avoid-emotional-constipation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (emotional constipation.)  </a></li><li> <strong>  Be compassionate. </strong>  Acknowledge the fact that it is completely normal to have ups and downs. Compassion isn&rsquo;t the same as complacence. It&rsquo;s a tool you can use to give yourself love. Whether that be through changing the words you use to describe yourself, staying present, or treating yourself like you&rsquo;d treat a friend, there are many ways you can increase your self-compassion.</li><li> <strong>  Act on it. </strong>  From a space of awareness, take action. It can be going for a walk, meditating, or calling a friend. Sometimes, action can be non-action. It can be not sending an angry text, having patience, or walking away. <br/>  </li><p> Feeling our feelings isn&rsquo;t something we&rsquo;re taught in school. It makes sense that we suck at it. <br/> We've emphasized learning skills that are &ldquo;marketable,&rdquo; and ignored the ones that make us happy. <br/> Isn't it time we changed that?</p><p> <strong>  MY ADVICE?  <br/>  BE GENTLE. BE BRAVE. BE COMPASSIONATE.  </strong></p>",

Consider this:</p><li> When the affluent are asked what they want from the financial services sector: <strong>  77% say wealth management. </strong></li><li> When they were asked what they perceived they got from the sector: <strong>  81% say product push. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> What does wealth management mean? To me, and I think to countless numbers of your clients, it means concierge service. It means help me have a better, more comfortable life. It does not mean jam more product and market insight at me. Stop selling products and begin selling you as the trusted adviser-the one person who can make my life better.</p><p> Let me explain it this way. I believe there are three types of people walking around God's great planet. I will, for this example, label them as follows:</p><li> Intentional Disconnector</li><li> Unintentional Connector</li><li> Intentional Connector <br/>  </li><p> In this nonscientific, but radically practical example, <strong>  the Intentional Disconnector is the person who deliberately wreaks havoc on relationships. </strong> He/she is constantly complaining, creating conflict, and looking for fights. They seek to destroy relationships. They are often times the \"victim.\" The good news is that this group of people represents the vast minority; let's say 10%. If they are your employees or clients, fire them. If they are in your family, God bless you.</p><p> <strong>  The Unintentional Connector represents that largest group of people; let's say 80% of the population. These are good intentioned, hardworking men and women </strong> who simply by being alive, conscious, and active in their life are connecting people to people and creating mainly positive relationships. The challenge here is that this group is doing it unintentionally. The results are good, but they are unaware of the power of what they are doing in life.</p><p> <strong>  Therefore, the \"power\" position is the Intentional Connector </strong> , defined as practical and aware that relationships matter, they drive results and understand that engaging with people in a positive way is life changing. This small group of intentional, positive relationship creators-or said differently, those who create intimacy-will be happier and more successful. They clearly look for new relationships and ways to go deeper into those relationships. This is the place we want to spend most of our time. If you can set yourself apart, be an intentional connector in people's lives, you will be an intimate adviser and reap all that is available to you.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SanFranciscoVC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Phil Sanderson  </u> </a> &ldquo;&hellip;like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week&rdquo; &mdash;Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Hold Us&rdquo; People often ask me if I watch &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Shark Tank  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; what I think about the reality show, and whether or not it&rsquo;s an accurate representation of venture capital.To answer the first question, I&rsquo;m a big fan of &ldquo;Shark Tank.&rdquo; The judges are always entertaining, and the pitches are interesting and different from the ones I see as a VC.Does the show accurately represent the pitch scenes I see as a venture capitalist? Yes and no.I&rsquo;ll start with the differences:</p><li> <strong>  The speed of deals: </strong>  unlike on &ldquo;Shark Tank,&rdquo; VCs don&rsquo;t typically make investment decisions within minutes. The process is deliberate, more details are assessed and several in-person communications are exchanged between founders and VCs &mdash; all before a decision is made.</li><li> <strong>  Founder credentials and character: </strong>  this one is related to the above point on the speed of deals. Because deals are rejected or negotiated within minutes on &ldquo;Shark Tank,&rdquo; the Sharks focus on the numbers, i.e., revenue, product, market opportunity. That&rsquo;s probably the right focus given such a short timeframe. When I&rsquo;m evaluating a pitch idea, I take the time to assess the character and credentials of the founders. Can they lead a team? Are they strategic thinkers? Are they trustworthy? What are past indicators of success? Obtaining these insights involves speaking and meeting with founders&rsquo; personal, business, and (if applicable) customer references.</li><li> <strong>  The deal terms: </strong>  we&rsquo;ve seen plenty of instances in which Sharks offer their commitment in exchange for upwards of 51% ownership or future revenue of the company. The show&rsquo;s investors definitely live up to the stereotype of VCs as sharks capitalizing on founders&rsquo; vulnerable need for funding. But these types of lopsided deals rarely happen, if ever, in my world. Stripping founders of majority ownership is a recipe for disempowerment. My goal is to let founders do what they know best while providing funding and support  to help them succeed. It&rsquo;s true that the standard investment deal yields a higher return for investors in the event of an exit. But like any investment, there are no  guarantees to a startup&rsquo;s success. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a bigger monetary risk &mdash; and thus potential return &mdash; for VCs.</li><li> <strong>  The competition between VCs: </strong> there are plenty of tense moments when Sharks get feisty and competitive over a deal. Cuban even told Entertainment Weekly, &ldquo;Trust me, there are times when you just want to reach over and punch Kevin or Lori.&rdquo; In the real world, there&rsquo;s far less drama, and the competition between VCs is more accurately characterized as cooperative competition, or &ldquo;co-opetition.&rdquo; While VCs may be in the same market to fund the most successful number startups, we often encounter opportunities in which collaboration &mdash; rather than competition &mdash; is more advantageous for driving value. Put simply, co-opetition allows VCs to share and syndicate deals to pool resources and risk.</li><li> <strong>  The entertainment level: </strong>  I love the theatrics on &ldquo;Shark Tank,&rdquo; from the Sharks&rsquo; harsh rejections to the pitches involving singing, dancing, and props. All that makes for great TV, but not so much for real life. In my pitch meetings, conversations get animated or products are demoed, but not nearly as dramatically as on &ldquo;Shark Tank.&rdquo; Also, there&rsquo;s really no benefit to harshly criticizing a pitch. I&rsquo;ve been an entrepreneur on the other side of the funding conversation, and I know it requires bravery and vulnerability. If a pitch lacks the legs to convince me to invest, I prefer providing productive feedback that may help founders succeed in the future.</li>Now, onto the similarities between &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; and real-life venture capital:<li> <strong>  The pitching fundamentals:  </strong> the main components of &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; pitches is similar to what I see in the VC world. On the show, contestants describe the market opportunity, the problem(s) solved by the product or service, and how the solution will be monetized to generate revenue. This is the general (and necessary) formula in the pitches I evaluate. Of course, these fundamentals alone aren&rsquo;t sufficient to a successful pitch. Read my  <u>  <a href=\"http://sfvc.com/2014/03/17/the-art-of-nailing-the-vc-pitch/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tips on nailing the pitch  </a> </u>  for more details.</li><li> <strong>  Upfront clarifications on investment goals and equity: prior to their pitches, </strong> &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; participants always provide information on the amount of money they&rsquo;re trying to raise and the percentage of equity they are willing to exchange for that investment. In the real world, this conversation also happens early in the pitch process. It&rsquo;s important to disclose these expectations straightaway so founders and VCs can gauge whether the opportunity is even worth pursuing. Like on &ldquo;Shark Tank,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve seen plenty examples of founders drastically overpricing their company or setting irrational investment goals. That never bodes well for a VC, and may indicate poor judgement or lack of strategic vision.</li><li> <strong>  VCs add value beyond investments:  </strong> the investors on &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; were chosen for very obvious reasons &mdash; they&rsquo;re not only successful investors in their own rights, they are also rich sources of expertise, connections, and opportunities. Shark Lori Greiner has leveraged her close connections with QVC to promote &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; products on the popular home shopping network. Mark Cuban has reached an iconic level as a businessman, and his connections span far beyond his robust sports network &mdash; making him a very valuable source of opportunities for any founder. Similarly, as a VC, my monetary investments are only part of the value I provide to companies. I advise founders on market and product strategy, recruit key employees, make introductions to other VCs and influencers &mdash; all to help founders succeed.</li>&ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; makes for great television, and it provides enough similarities to real-world pitching to be instructional for entrepreneurs. But most of all, with 6,000,000 weekly viewers, the show is emblematic of America&rsquo;s enthusiasm for entrepreneurial pursuits. &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; is an important reminder and inspiration of the opportunities, risks, and rewards available to any entrepreneur with the vision, the will, and the right pitch.P.S. China&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;Shark Tank,&rdquo; called &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win_in_China\" target=\"_blank\">  Win in China </a></u>,&rdquo; attracts an even larger audience of 200,000,000 weekly viewers and features my IDG Ventures colleague <u> <a href=\"http://www.idgvc.com/team/hugo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hugo Shong </a></u> as a judge.

    "title": "Essential Social Media Habits for Advisors to Get Better Results",
    "link": "essential-social-media-habits-for-advisors-to-get-better-results",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  No matter where you look there are countless articles on the importance of a social media presence for financial advisors. </strong> Social media is nothing new. Although many advisors have established a profile on at least one social network, it simply isn&rsquo;t enough to create value. </p><p> <strong>  Social media profiles need to be more than a warehouse to store your name, photo, and credentials. </strong> As an advisor, you need to provide an online home where your community can gather, engage with you, and find valuable resources.</p><p> Here are some essential social habits you can start using today to get better results:</p><p> <strong>  1. Create Attention Grabbing Headlines </strong> <br/> Rather than posting a title, liven things up by using a key takeaway from an article. Sometimes, statistics or key information included in a newsletter or blog will achieve better results than the title itself. Play with two to three different headlines for the same post and watch to see which performs best.</p><p> <strong>  2. Use Social Media to Build Your Prospect List </strong> <br/> Avoid posts that only try to sell your product. Direct online communities to the email sign up on your website. This will boost your prospect list while giving you an opportunity to build a relationship with your connections and followers and eventually move them into your sales funnel.</p><p> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t Be Afraid of Diversification </strong> <br/> You don&rsquo;t need to sign up for every social platform available but don&rsquo;t be afraid to utilize multiple channels. By engaging on different social networks you can connect with clients, prospects, and other industry influencers. Follow industry leaders and sprinkle some of their content into your posts. With the right strategy, this can present an opportunity for leading industry publications to share your content and help you establish influence.</p><p> <strong>  4. Use LinkedIn Publisher </strong> <br/> In my opinion, LinkedIn Publisher is one of the most powerful publishing tools available right now.  Take advantage of the free blogging tool to promote your content. Your articles will reach your network and have the potential to be shared with LinkedIn groups and LinkedIn Pulse readers, all of which prove to be a valuable opportunity to grow your business.</p><p> <strong>  5. Create Community Groups </strong> <br/> Create groups based on specific demographics and needs within each social channel. For example; you could create a LinkedIn group that represents one of your niche markets or a Facebook group for women in transition. This allows you to provide relevant information the group can personally relate to.</p><p> <strong>  6. Use Video </strong> <br/> Today&rsquo;s generation prefers watching a quick 2-3 minute video versus reading a lengthy article. Videos help you communicate key points to a target audience while establishing credibility and putting a face with your name.</p><p> <strong>  7. Understand Your Analytics </strong> <br/> In order to understand what is working and what isn&rsquo;t, you need to spend time analyzing. If you only spend your time executing, you will never understand the driving force to getting results. Schedule time on your calendar every month to review your analytics, your successes, and your failures. This is a good time to peek at the social strategy of your competition. You may find some new ideas to incorporate into your plan.</p><p> <strong>  8. Audit Your Social Profiles Monthly </strong> <br/> Audit your social profiles monthly to ensure your information is up to date and that your branding message is consistent across all social networks. Make an action plan for improvements.</p><p> <strong>  9. Ask For Feedback </strong> <br/> Talk to one client every month about your social media approach. Ask which social networks they use and why. Identify what they want and expect from you and make sure they are receiving value from the information you post.</p><p> <strong>  10. Test, Test, and Test Again </strong> <br/> Social media marketing is always changing. As we&rsquo;ve learned from Facebook, a once relatively free site, now wants you to &ldquo;pay-to-play.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t give up, there are many alternatives. The key is to experiment and run in-house testing to determine which methods provide you with the best results. </p><p> <strong>  Establishing a social media presence is no longer an optional task; it&rsquo;s required to authentic your firm in the digital world. </strong> Having up-to-date profiles is as important as having a website or a business card. </p>",

    "content": "<p> From the air, the British Virgin Islands appear as an idyllic archipelago, peeking peacefully above tranquil shades of aquamarine blue, completely ringed with bright, white, sugar sand. From the deck of your private luxury yacht charter, the BVI proves even more inviting, welcoming with incredible geography and epic island hangouts. You won&rsquo;t need a tuxedo here, but extra swimwear and a few pairs of rubbadem are essential, as casual is the height of fashion in the islands.</p><p> Nothing is more enjoyable, nor more memorable, than a bashment on the beach, mehson. And, nowhere in the world does a party have the flavor the British Virgin Islands. Prepare to indulge in a most welcoming, laid back explore of the BVI&rsquo;s pretty peaks and beaches from your sumptuous private yacht. Guaranteed, you will experience an unwind here far beyond what was previously  thought possible.</p><p> <strong>  Day 1: </strong> Tortola is a fabulous initiation to this blissful week. With all the elements of a city, yet little of the stress, there are delightful diversions dotting the island. As the BVI&rsquo;s main island, Tortola sets the stage, echoing historic steps of Christopher Columbus, Sir Frances Drake, and notable pirates and privateers including the infamous Blackbeard. Settle into your plush digs on board the yacht, then switch to island casual attire for a leisurely tour, perhaps taking in a little sample at the Callwood Rum Distillery, stopping by the Ample Hamper in Road Town for fine wine and packaged culinary treats, and picking up some of the colorful Caribbean stamps at the post office on Main Street. Finish with dinner at the Brandywine Estate on the south end of the island. Lobster &amp; fennel salad, seafood amuse bouche, superb local catch, and a beautiful view are yours for the taking. For an historic evening, dine by candlelight at the <u>  Sugar Mill </u> , or order up an elegant repast at <u>  The Dove </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Day 2: </strong> After a quick cruise to Peter Island, drop anchor for a swim and a snorkel at Honeymoon Beach, a romantic, private, small sneak of sand with beautiful surroundings. Then head into the <u>  <a href=\"http://peterisland.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Peter Island Resort  </a> </u> for your spa appointment. The day spa menu at the Peter Island Resort is a luxurious blend of island ingredients with Ayurvedic treaments.

Swim through the caves, and into some of the world&rsquo;s most mesmerizing snorkeling reefs. Dine at the <u>  Bitter End Yacht Club </u> , with sea-to-table delicacies in the Clubhouse, or prepare a private beach dinner, followed by a glamorous evening on board the yacht. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3_6.png\" width=\"902\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 4: </strong> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.b-v-i.com/Anegada/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Anegada  </a> </u> is the northernmost of the British Virgins, departing from the volcanic origins of her sister islands. Resting atop a coral atoll, the island is flat, green, and colorful, as flocks of pink flamingoes find solace on the island&rsquo;s interior salt ponds. Home to the largest coral reef in the Caribbean, opt to anchor out and tender in for beach browsing. Earn master status fishing for bonefish in the flats, or flyfishing for your dinner. Spend the evening on board the yacht, enjoying your catch prepared on board with a toast to the celestial show as the sun slips below the curve of the water.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4_5.png\" width=\"902\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 5: </strong> Marina Cay peeks up out of the brilliant blue lagoon, showing off its lush flowers amid deep green fauna. The pastoral lagoon with its calm, warm water is the perfect snorkeling destination, with large populations of colorful, tropical fish. Breeze through Pusser&rsquo;s Rum general store, stocked with branded clothing, souvenirs, and of course, Pusser&rsquo;s Rum. Stroll to the top of the island to the Robb White Bar for a sip and an post card view.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5_4.png\" width=\"902\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 6: </strong> Soggy Dollar Bar;  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jost_Van_Dyke\" target=\"_blank\">   Jost Van Dyke  </a> </u> is best known for its extremely laid back atmosphere, typified by <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ivanscampground.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ivan&rsquo;s Stress Free Bar  </a> </u> .

    "content": "<p> Last month, I wrote about  <u>  <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2015/02/google-layoffs-haven.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   why I think Google will have to lay off as many as 10,000 employees in the coming year  </a> </u> . (The bottom line being: expenses are rising out of control, while Google's core business faces an uncertain future.) Yahoo is in an even more precarious position. Before the year is out, Marissa Mayer will have no choice but to implement a serious \"reduction in force\" (to use HR parlance). Either that, or the company will need to merge with AOL&mdash;and then suffer the headcount reduction. <br/> <br/> Before Marissa Mayer came in as CEO of Yahoo, the company&rsquo;s annual EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, etc.) was $1.5 billion, as of 2011.  For this year, Bloomberg estimates Yahoo will produce $1.1 billion in EBITDA, a roughly 30% drop in profitability since Mayer took over. In the same time frame, Yahoo&rsquo;s revenues have dropped 12%, from $5 billion to an expected $4.4 billion.  This, as Facebook tripled its revenues and Google increased its top line 60%.</p><p> Eric Jackson, writing at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2015/03/01/yahoos-incredible-shrinking-profitability-in-its-core-business/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes.com  </a> </u> , found that after you strip away the various patent licensing deals and other special forms of income that have expiration dates on them, you find that Yahoo's core business is generating only $190 million in EBITDA, not $1.1 billion. So in other words, Yahoo may be able to offer a rosy picture to the world for another quarter or two, but eventually the emperor's robes come off. And it's pretty clear that none of Marissa Mayer's acquisitions, nor the Katie Couric deal (which isn't moving the needle for Yahoo News traffic), nor any of Mayer's other failed initiatives, are suddenly going to rescue the company's profitability to the tune of a billion dollars by year's end. <br/> <br/> Jackson sees no alternative but a huge layoff. Given that Yahoo (with one third the revenue of Facebook) employs more people than Facebook, it's hard to disagree with Jackson's analysis. He notes:</p>Of course, I have long argued that Yahoo&rsquo;s core business is obscenely over-staffed.  Not just a little, but a lot.  I agree with <u> Marc Andreessen's</u> advice to Marissa Mayer back in 2012 that she should immediately let go of 10,000 people.  Although Yahoo reports in their 10-K that they have 12,500 &ldquo;full time and fixed term contractors,&rdquo; they never state how many &ldquo;variable term contractors&rdquo; they employ.  Yahoo has played this game long before Mayer showed up as CEO, but she has carried on the tradition with a vengeance.<br/> <p> Yahoo's core problem, of course, is that it doesn't have a core business. It's a crazy-quilt of search, news, apps, e-mail, and social nonsense, without a mission statement. It's the new AOL (which is why the two companies should merge). Maybe AOL, which has grown its top line 3 out of the last 4 quarters without resorting to bizarre one-off patent deals, can teach Yahoo a thing or two about running a business. <br/> <br/> Just for fun, I ran a Google Trends search on Yahoo, Twitter, and Instagram. The trend lines show Yahoo and Twitter peaking in 2009 and 2013, while Instagram (owned by Facebook) is uptrending nicely.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-09-at-10.27.57-AM.png\" width=\"549\"/>  </p><p> Amazingly, and perhaps tellingly,  <u>  <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ao?s=YHOO+Analyst+Opinion\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   24 out of 37 analysts have a Buy or Strong Buy rating for Yahoo stock right now  </a> </u> . That alone is disconcerting. (When that many analysts line up behind what's obviously a shaky stock, it makes me want to run for the exits.) Analyst price targets range from $50 to $69 (N=31 analysts).  <br/> <br/> Personally, I look for YHOO to go to $38 and I'd be a strong seller of it right here, right now, based on the information in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2015/03/01/yahoos-incredible-shrinking-profitability-in-its-core-business/\" target=\"_blank\">   Jackson's excellent Forbes.com piece  </a> </u>  and Mayer's track record of abject incompetence. </p>",

    "content": "<p> When considering investment needed to drive growth for your company, the options seem simple &ndash; more Marketing and more Sales. The hard part is figuring out how to do it. There are more options now than ever to consider on placement of investments that have downstream impact on revenue and client success.</p><p> The best method to determining how to start, is to begin by asking questions. The following will lead you toward the right direction on how to invest your time and/or resources:</p><p> <strong>  Do you know what is already working and what is not with Sales? </strong></p><li> Does Sales need more help closing deals or getting them into the pipeline?</li><li> When Sales first interacts with a potential client, is it hard to explain what your company does and how it benefits the potential client?</li><li> What is the process like for the potential customer when they are interested in buying your solution?</li><li> Once customers are on-boarded, are they happy with the solution they have bought?</li><li> Who in your organization ensures your clients&rsquo; success? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Do you know what is already working and what is not with Marketing? </strong></p><li> What is it about your solution that makes your clients so happy or successful using it?</li><li> What Marketing channels work the best to bring in clients (not leads, but clients)?</li><li> What verticals and/or segments provide the best Life Time Value (LTV) to your company?</li><li> What do you get back from every $1 you invest and where does it come from?</li><li> Who are your best people and why?</li><p> <br/> In answering these questions you should have a better understanding of your process. Why does that matter? Because all investments work well when the time and/or resources are applied within a process. Think about it &mdash; If you want to put more into Marketing, does it go toward developing content? Advertising? Partnerships? People? If you make that investment in Marketing and it pays off by producing more qualified opportunities for Sales to work on, then you have to think about how they handle it? Are they set up to scale? Will they still provide a good experience for potential and current clients?</p><p> The balance between investment in Marketing and Sales must be made with either developing more interest, converting that interest into potential clients, and keeping those clients happy.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In my work with successful professionals, I notice a clear commonality to each of them:</p><p> <strong>  They invest in their success, which means they invest in themselves. </strong></p><p> But that&rsquo;s not always easy for a lot of people. They don&rsquo;t understand the value of the investment, and are often wary of spending time or money before they receive any returns, simply because they don&rsquo;t see that the returns will be greater than what they invest.</p><p> Allow me to elaborate&hellip;</p><p> We all have the same amount of time; time being the most universal of currencies. Money is a secondary currency, given that some of us have more than others. A third component is connections. Without relationships, it's hard to build anything. Time, money and connections open a lot of doors. I&rsquo;m sure you have found that in your own life.</p><p> <strong>  Success is always a work in progress. </strong> I like to think of it as a construction site. You&rsquo;re building for the future.</p><p> To be successful there are always investments required long before the anticipated success arrives and usually, well after. You have invested in your education to build your skill sets. You have invested in your business to create brand awareness. You have invested lots of time making the connections you need to build your clientele. But have you invested in yourself to discover how much more there is of you to bring to the world?</p><p> If you are having the following thoughts&hellip;</p><li> I'm committed to growth, and... something's blocking my success.</li><li> I work hard and.. I'm not getting the recognition I deserve in my career.</li><li> I'm ready to take the next big leap, and...I have fears about failing</li><li> I want greater balance between my work and personal life, and... I'm not sure what that looks like. <br/>  </li><p> You are having a conversation with yourself about how to develop your potential, and you are looking for a way to invest your time, money and connections to make it happen. But are you taking action to remedy this? Are you investing for future ROI?</p><p> <strong>  None of us achieves our success alone. </strong>  There are always people who helped make it happen. The investment we make in connecting with them, inviting them in as teachers, guides, mentors or otherwise, pays off in large currency at the end of the day. You build and achieve according to your strengths and weaknesses, and your ability to take risks.</p><p> For over thirty years, I have personally invested hundreds of thousands of dollars on getting to know me. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, at times if was painful, challenging and very risky. But it was honest, I was determined, and with time, money and connections, I discovered an amazing woman hiding under all the garbage.</p><p> When you prevaricate, deny or refuse to invest in you, you are essentially shutting the door on the prospect of a successful future, and more important, a fulfilling life.</p><p> The fear of making a mistake, either with your time or money is so real that you may take no risk at all. When you don&rsquo;t develop your network for success, you are missing out on thousands of dollars, and more importantly people who will become your champions.</p><p> Making this kind of investment has paid off handsomely with a life of nomadic living around the globe, raising my children, writing books, making music, and enjoying the fruits of my success. But it didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p><p> I invested more time, money and connections to build my motivational training practice, and have reaped enormous rewards from everyone I have the opportunity to work with. This chapter of my life is the most fulfilling, and I would not have had it if I had not invested in my future.</p><p> <strong>  Investing in you is the greatest investment of your life. </strong> It opens doors to all kinds of opportunities that you don&rsquo;t even know exist, or that you&rsquo;re capable of fulfilling.</p><p> To get to the finish line, you have to run the race. So if you&rsquo;re standing here, and wish to be over there, start moving your feet!</p><p> <strong>  Begin investing in yourself today. </strong> Find an advisor, ask for help, build your network. If you want to develop a strong ROI on the greatest investment of your life, take the next step.</p>",

How did the company turn around losses of more than $300m a year? Lego&rsquo;s CEO Jorgen Vig Knudstorp was responsible for a turnaround that was unimaginable ten years ago. According to a great article in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1234465/When-Lego-lost-head--toy-story-got-happy-ending.html#ixzz3TRK4eDEr%20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Daily Mail  </a> </u> , he consulted old colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (where he studied for a PhD in business and economics), who told him Lego is the ideal way for a child to learn how to think systematically and creatively &ndash; something that was confirmed to him by a cover story in Time, in which the Google founders said that it was Lego that had shaped their young minds.</p><p> Despite the growth of the company over the years, here was confirmation that the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; was under their noses the whole time:</p><p> <strong>  &lsquo;Inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow&rsquo; </strong> <br/> Our ultimate purpose is to inspire and develop children to think creatively, reason systematically and release their potential to shape their own future &ndash; experiencing the endless human possibility.</p><p> What followed was a re-organization of the company to ensure that every aspect of the company lined up with this purpose. It meant getting back to basics, fulfilling orders in a timely manner and diluting their interests in initiatives that didn&rsquo;t align with this mission. Purpose was pursued over profit.</p><p> What Lego and countless other purpose driven companies have proven is that a unified mission and vision that pursues  <u>  purpose over profit </u>  leads to profit more often than it doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> Could your business do with re-focusing on it&rsquo;s core values, purpose and mission? Would you be in all of the markets and product lines you are in today if you were to truly align with your purpose. It&rsquo;s a worthwhile exercise. Ask Lego.</p><p> We covered the famous Stengel 50 research  <u>  earlier this week </u>  discussing how the top 50 of 50,000 brands studied over 10 years outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 1200% over the period of the study.

His friends noticed that his passion actually translated into fabulous wines. One friend (we'll call him Carl) asked him to throw a wine tasting event for his team. It was a huge success and Carl offered to pay Ron for the event and Ron declined because he said he loved doing it. He was living his purpose by being able to provide wine and make people appreciate his new art.</p><p> When Carl heard Ron's response, he asked him: \" Why is it that you believe that I shouldn't pay you for the work you love? You get to pursue your purpose and get paid for it. Isn't that work should be?\"</p><p> This story resonates with me because work should be fun. We spend so much time preparing for that point in our lives when we go to work and today's reality is that so many people are unhappy at work. Many feel under appreciated or have been shuffled by the latest re-organization into a job that they neither chose or enjoy. Ironically, we all know that when people can bring who they are and their passion to a job, they are not only more productive but they are passionate about helping the organization achieve its purpose. These organizations simply have happier people who make better products and provide better customer service.</p><p> There is a growing desire with most people, regardless of their age or generation, to enjoy their work and not dread Monday rolling around. But fear and scarcity are alive and well and too many organization are still stuck in these 20th-century management practices instead of embracing the 21st-century practices of shared purpose and collaboration.</p><p> <strong>  Why does it take a major trauma to wake us up? </strong></p><p> Someone recently shared with me that when he was staring at death, he realized \"nothing else will ever kill me.\" It's sad that life and death situations too often make us appreciate how precious life is and gives us the courage to pursue our purpose. What happened to that dream we had when we were seven years old and wanted to ignite the world with our passion? It was way before a \"grown-up\" started teaching us the rules of being polite and responsible, which led to our socialization and conformity. Do you remember that dream? What happened to it?</p><p> Being curious is a gift. We live in a world of opportunities and possibilities and it's time to stop following the mainstream. There is courage in not only being curious but also taking action and allowing ourselves to experiment outside of our matured comfort zone. The magic happens when we allow ourselves to be uncomfortable. What can you do to get comfortable with being uncomfortable?</p><p> <strong>  Please don't give away your power </strong></p><p> As individuals, we need to make sure we are creating the life we want and not giving away our personal power. I recently met two people who are being bullied by their manager at work and it breaks my heart to see this happening because of old-world hierarchies where the person at the top of the antiquated pyramid abuses their power. Listening to their stories, it is apparent to me that it is only a matter of time that they will either leave or the company will not succeed.</p><p> Imagine if they had a blank canvas an no power structure but shared purpose, where everyone in the organization not only knew their role in achieving the purpose but also the tools and management support to achieve collective success? What would they be able to create in the world and how were their days be spent? Unfortunately, because of a manager who abuses her power, they are not able to come and work. Their manager is not focused on building a business but victimizing people who report to them. In a 20th-century model, managers managed adults and in this century, managers should be solving problems and managing projects. In this specific scenario, everyone loses. And the cost to the human spirit is way too high on so many levels.</p><p> <strong>  So what can we do to not give our power away? </strong></p><p> Every single person in this universe is unique and so these are just some thoughts that only you know if they apply to your situation. Here are some of my suggestions to consider:</p><li> <strong>  Our greatest vulnerability drive us to the door steps of opportunity. </strong> This is an opportunity to face your fear and ask yourself: \"what's the worst thing that could happen if I stopped giving away my power to others?\"</li><li> <strong>  If you are in a situation where someone is using their position of power at work to force you do things you don't want to do, ask for help from your friends or community </strong> . Too often, we convince ourselves that this too shall pass, or we find ourselves in denial that this is happening. I was brought up in a world where there is truth and justice so it would be unheard of that a c-level executive or manager would abuse their position. But it happens all the time. And yet, we don't have to stay in a bad situation. We do have alternatives but we need to do the hard work and get ourselves out as the price of staying and being abused is way too high. Not all managers are good people and we need to know when it's time to walk away. Staying means we are giving our own personal power away.</li><li> <strong>  We all need to make a living and pay our bills. But let's not forget that we are in control of our lives. </strong> We can determine how small or big are bills need to be by not giving our power away to advertisers and marketers who tell us that more is better. Spend some time thinking about what's your enough? This will help you not be a slave to a lifestyle or a habit that you are trying to feed at the expense of living your purpose.</li><p> It's time to figure out where you are giving away your power in your life and career and ask yourself if it's worth it.</p><p> <strong>  Only you can choose your path </strong></p><p> New is not always better. Some people are moving away from self interest and material gain to a paradigm of sharing and connecting, where empathy becomes more important. If your dream is to accumulate more and more stuff, more power to you. You know what's important to your well being. But if it isn't, maybe you'll shift to making a life and not just a living?</p><p> <strong>  You should love what you do not do what you love! </strong> When people start making a difference in the work they do, they fall in love with it. It's addictive. The answer is in deciding what you want to make and love to do. No one can tell you how to do it. There is no dummy's guide. Now that is something worth thinking about. Are you willing to do what other people won't?</p>",

    "content": "<p> It was a long time ago now that I first started to ride, and eventually own, a horse. Somewhere along the way I found Tom Widdicombe&rsquo;s book, Be With Your Horse . I recall him writing that every horse has two questions: &ldquo;Am I safe with you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are you fit to be my leader?&rdquo; <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a> Not only was this good advice for being with my horse, but I realized its value in the workplace. Perhaps it is not in your lexicon, but the expression, &lsquo;being called on the carpet&rsquo; is certainly in mine. Getting summoned to the boss&rsquo;s office seemed to seldom be equated with something good happening, but imagine the empowerment that flows from a workforce where literally everyone feels they can walk into your office, offer an idea, or make a point about something and feel not only truly embraced, but that they will likely see the outcome of their contribution as it becomes a reality.</p><p> <strong>  You can prove that your office is the safest place in the organization by showing your vulnerability. </strong> I used to think that I was weak because I worried that I would make the wrong decision. I finally discovered that what I thought was a character flaw was actually a wonderful gift, because along with self-reflection came the realization that sharing issues with colleagues&mdash;welcoming them into my space&mdash;gave them the very strength they needed to be able to help me! Vulnerability is at the root of authenticity, and authenticity is the foundation for leadership.</p><p> <strong>  Are you safe to be with? Are you fit to be a leader? </strong> Will you serve those that seek to serve the business, and to grow in the process? As managers we are the custodians of the company&rsquo;s ethics and values. Right and wrong are truly powerful concepts and are borne aloft in the culture that we permit and uphold.</p><p> And who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll enjoy the ride!</p><p> Published with acknowledgement to Thomson Carswell, publishers of the 2 nd edition of Sales Force Management in the Financial Services by Paul K. Bates, from which parts of this article were drawn.</p><p> <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a> Widdicombe, Tom.

    "title": "Four Ways to Make Decision-Making a Little Easier",
    "link": "four-ways-to-make-decision-making-a-little-easier",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Decision-making is top-of-mind because I have a many decisions to make in the coming months, large and small. Naturally, I&rsquo;d like to have a good way to make them. I suppose some of you may be interested in the same? Maybe you&rsquo;re considering a leap into the self-employed life. Maybe you&rsquo;ve been given a new opportunity with your current company. Maybe you just need to decide if you should say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; to a new project. Regardless of what your current dilemma is, I think one of the following four techniques can help.</p><p> <strong>  Make a list. </strong></p><p> This is a tried-and-true method. Pull out a clean sheet of paper and a pen and you list the Pros and Cons. Then, you see which column has more weight and that&rsquo;s your answer. It&rsquo;s an way to approach a decision with logic and order, so it&rsquo;s worth trying. (Full disclaimer: it doesn&rsquo;t work for me. I&rsquo;m really good at tricking myself into making both sides of the list balanced. At the end of the exercise I&rsquo;m usually more torn up about what to do than when I started. But it might work for you!)</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DECISIONS-1.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> <strong>  Try it on for 24. </strong></p><p> My mentor recommends that if you&rsquo;re considering a change, you should spend one day living as if you have said &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. For that 24 hours, pay attention to how you feel. Worried, weighed down and unhappy? Say, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Excited, energized and upbeat? I think you know the answer.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DECISIONS-2.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> <strong>  Create an alter ego. </strong></p><p> This technique riffs off the previous strategy, but is more involved and works especially well for big decisions. When I came to a sticky time in my self-employed career, someone walked me through this mental exercise that I now call &lsquo;creating an alter ego&rsquo;. Imagine you are yourself, but there is another person who is exactly like you and is in the exact same position as you. He or she has the same passions, talents, experiences and drive. Give that person a name. For illustration-sake, let&rsquo;s name our alter-ego Julie.</p><p> You and Julie start at Point A. Point A is today. The decision-making. You go one way (just pick one side of your decision &ndash; it can be either side), she goes the other. Imagine walking away from each other.</p><p> <u>  Ask yourself these questions: </u></p><li> How do you feel?</li><li> What are you worried about?</li><li> What are you excited about?</li><p> Now imagine that it&rsquo;s a year from now. This is Point B. You and Julie get together for coffee to catch up.</p><p> <u>  Ask yourself these questions: </u></p><li> How do you feel toward Julie?</li><li> What does Julie know that you don&rsquo;t?</li><li> What do you know that Julie doesn&rsquo;t?</li><li> What did Julie get to do in the last year?</li><li> What have you done in the last year?</li><li> Do you want to be Julie?</li><p> You can take this even further and reconvene at a Point C, five years down the road too, if you&rsquo;d like. I&rsquo;d be really surprised if this imaginary friend didn&rsquo;t help you make your decision.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DECISIONS-3.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> <strong>  Flip a coin. </strong></p><p> Sounds stupid, huh? Stick with me. What&rsquo;s a decision you&rsquo;ve been trying to make lately? Once you have that in mind, pull out a coin. Now, determine which side of the coin represents which side of your decision. Ready, set&hellip;flip! When the coin is mid-air&hellip;in that suspenseful moment where movie producers consistently insist on slowing down the film speed to an agonizing crawl&hellip;listen to your heart. It&rsquo;s in that split second when the toss could go either way that a voice from somewhere inside of you tells you what you really want. It works.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DECISIONS-4-2.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> So, how do you make decisions? Will you try something new next time?</p>",

One day, the president called me into his office and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to work with [X] today. He talks so fast, he actually cuts off members during presentations and conversations &ndash; I just can&rsquo;t take it anymore. He has to change the way he talks, or he&rsquo;ll be out of a job.

In the 30 years that I&rsquo;ve been working as a speechwriter and executive coach, the problem of &ldquo;annoying voices&rdquo; comes up more than any other problem.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a question for you:</p><p> How fast do you talk? If you talk too fast, you will lose your audiences. If you talk <strong>  way </strong> too fast, you will annoy your audiences as well as lose them. And if you talk too slow, you&rsquo;ll flat-out bore them.</p><p> Start by getting feedback from people you know. Ask helpful colleagues to pay attention to your speed when you give a presentation or moderate a conference call or handle a Q&amp;A.</p><p> Continue by getting feedback from anonymous sources. Simply prepare an evaluation form for your next big speech and include a quick question about vocal speed. When people feel anonymous, they are often more candid with their speaker evaluations.</p><p> Whatever your vocal issues, resolve to improve them &ndash; the sooner, the better.</p><p> 1. <strong>  If you talk too fast </strong> : Write your speech using shorter sentences. When delivering a long list of items, try writing those items in a column &ndash; the list format should slow down your delivery.</p><p> 2. <strong>  If you talk too slow </strong> : Identify the 10 most important words/phrases/statistics in your speech, and emphasize them.

    "content": "<p> I hear more and more grousing about Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm these days&mdash;people complaining that Facebook won&rsquo;t show their posts to their followers. Ok, here&rsquo;s my two cents: <strong>  yes it does, if you bother to visit their pages! </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s amazing to me that most people just don&rsquo;t want to do the relationship building work that social requires. <strong> </strong> They want it handed to them on a silver platter. <strong>  If you create and post great content on your own feed, visit the feeds of your followers and make comments and share their stuff, then they will come to you. It&rsquo;s just not that complicated. </strong></p><p> Yes, you need an ad budget to help things along, but for heaven&rsquo;s sake&mdash;stop with the campaign mentality! People want to be treated like people, not targets. They want to have conversation with other individuals. They want to be recognized and appreciated for what they share on a human-to-human basis, not delivered Ads in a retargeting campaign that may or may not have anything to do with what they want right now.</p><p> Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm rewards authentic interaction, so if you want more action on your page, create a strategy of actually &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to people. Seek out the personal profiles of your followers and read their feeds. Find out who they are and what they&rsquo;re interested in and comment on their posts. Scale this by having your employees do the same.</p><p> There really is no way to automate this process, nor should you even try. Can you imagine what would happen if you sent a robot to a live networking event and it spit out your business cards and made random announcements about your blog or business offerings? Talk about a disconnect! Yet that&rsquo;s exactly what many businesses expect to do on social channels. If it doesn&rsquo;t work in face-to-face social settings, why would you expect it to work in digital ones?</p><p> The reason Facebook was created in the first place was to connect people. That&rsquo;s always been its mission. However, you can&rsquo;t have a user base of over a billion people without streamlining the newsfeed to some degree. Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm works in your favor when YOU do the work of getting to know people as individuals and conversing with them. It&rsquo;s that simple. And once you get to know folks on a personal level, you&rsquo;ll be better at two things: 1) showing them your human side, and 2) providing content that addresses their concerns and makes their lives easier. Both of these will be rewarded with the increased interaction that Facebook favors, so your content will be seen by more of your friends (and their friends).</p><p> Understand that when everything you posted hit the news feed of friends and followers, most of it was ignored just like Ads anyway, so for the most part you got a host of worthless impressions, not real viewing. <strong>  Now if someone sees your posts there&rsquo;s a reason, and the results will benefit you accordingly. </strong></p><p> So stop complaining and use the medium the way it was intended&mdash; <strong>  to build relationships! There&rsquo;s just no substitute for doing the work of personal interaction. </strong></p>",

I get emails and messages from clients who are getting job offers and moving on to bigger and better things; all because of their resume. Any resume writer or career coach will tell you that the resume and cover letter are the starting points to finding a new job.</p><p> With 25% job growth predicted for 2015 and the unemployment rate at 5.5%, people are moving along and getting jobs.  And with getting new jobs comes saying goodbye to old ones. When you think of the letter of resignation or 2 weeks&rsquo; notice, most of the time you think of drama or sadness, however that&rsquo;s not the case. <strong>  In fact putting in a resignation notice can be highlight of your year. </strong></p><p> Did you know that unless you have a work contract that a 2 weeks&rsquo; notice is not required by law; <strong>  it&rsquo;s just a professional courtesy </strong> ; which means you don&rsquo;t have to give your employer any notification if you don&rsquo;t want to. It&rsquo;s just the polite thing to do &ndash; you know that whole bridge burning thing.</p><p> I have read articles where people are forced to resign their position mainly because of doing something illegal, immoral, unethical or just stupid. I know sometimes people are forced out but for the most part when people quit, it's because they have found something better. They hated the old job and it was making them sick, so now they get to quit and work in a happier environment. The boss or coworkers were terrible and now they have found a great team. They didn&rsquo;t get to spend time with their kids so now they found something more flexible. You get the point.</p><p> Yeah, you get it. The 2 week notice is not a sad thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a good thing &ndash; no, it&rsquo;s a great thing. It represents a new endeavor - new terrain. <strong>  It&rsquo;s about growth and testing the market &ndash; taking on new challenges. </strong> It&rsquo;s busting past the status quo. It&rsquo;s not subscribing to the &ldquo;Happy to Have a Job Philosophy&rdquo;. Not allowing the golden handcuffs of tenure (benefits) to hold you hostage.  The 2 weeks&rsquo; notice is freedom &ndash; it&rsquo;s a commencement - it&rsquo;s a statement against complacency or entitlement.</p><p> It&rsquo;s happiness.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Times of downsizing and restucture require every ounce of confident humility you can muster. Your team is starving for information, reassurance, guidance and support. And quite frankly, I&rsquo;m amazed at how many leaders totally screw this up. In part I blame lawyers that scare the humanity and common sense out of otherwise sensible human beings. But mostly, it&rsquo;s layers of people not thinking through what it means to be at the other end of the conversation. Every one of these mistakes comes from real stories I&rsquo;ve heard or witnessed in the last year.</p><p> <strong>  1. Communicating Prematurely </strong></p><p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some exciting changes next year which will include an important restructure to streamline efficiencies and operations. More to come after the holidays.&rdquo; Seriously? Queue the massive energy drain, distraction, resume writing, sleepless nights, worried conversations, LinkedIn surfing, and butt kissing. Don&rsquo;t communicate until you&rsquo;ve got tangible information about structure and process. I&rsquo;m all for transparency, but vague vision without information does nothing to inspire trust or engagement. Wait to say something until you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p><p> <strong>  2. Restructuring in Waves </strong></p><p> Common in large companies, &ldquo;the planning team&rdquo; thinks it make sense to go one department at a time. I get it from a workload point of view, but consider the ripple effect. The stress and rumors circle the company like a wave of hands moving across the stadium. &ldquo;Where are they headed next?&rdquo; &ldquo;How many people got laid off?&rdquo; &ldquo;What process did they use?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did the good guys land?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve taken what could have been a month&rsquo;s worth of restructuring and spread the pain and suffering out across nine months to a year.</p><p> <strong>  3. Sloppy Administration </strong></p><p> &ldquo;My direct report just found out his job was eliminated by an email, before I even knew it.&rdquo; Even I couldn&rsquo;t believe this stupidity. As it turned out it was a glitch in an HR system that got the proverbial cart ahead of the horse. I&rsquo;ve experienced it directly too. I once received the entire restructuring plan, including all impacted names, intended for another &ldquo;Karin.&rdquo; I deleted it immediately and told the sender. A disgruntled employee could easily have sent it to the Wall Street Journal.</p><p> <strong>  4. Not Thinking Through the Details </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got 60 days to find a job.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;And what happens if you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I get a package.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What does the package include?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t decided yet.&rdquo;</p><p> Before you tell someone there job is impacted, image the next five questions you would ask if you were in their shoes. If you don&rsquo;t have the answers, get them first.</p><p> <strong>  5. Underestimating the Angst </strong></p><p> &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s important that no one miss a beat during this time, we&rsquo;ve got work to do.&rdquo; Of course that&rsquo;s true, but if people are worried about their livelihood, they&rsquo;ll put first things first. Pretending a big deal is no big deal will just reduce your credibility. Be available for support and as a sounding board. Give them the time they need to process, and they&rsquo;ll likely go back to work more focused.</p><p> Restructuring is often a necessary, bold leadership move. Be sure your execution is as solid as your plan.</p>",

Some questions answered in this article:</p><li> Do good liars have a higher IQ?</li><li> Which country cheats the most?</li><li> Who lies more, bankers or politicians? <br/>  </li><p> In this post I am going to take some of the best learnings from our February Book Club book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062183613/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062183613&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=DPVAIYZ4FOZX3VZV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Honest Truth About Dishonesty  </a> </u>  (by Dan Ariely) and the most interesting tidbits from the research on deception.</p><p> Lying is a part of human nature.</p><p> Even if we don&rsquo;t want to admit it, we all lie. You&rsquo;re a liar. I&rsquo;m a liar. We lie to others and we lie to ourselves. But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting&ndash;lying is not rational.</p><p> There is some surprising science about lying that will not only help you understand your fellow human beings, but it will also show you how to have more honest relationships, communication and work environments. Read on to find out why.</p><p> <strong>  1. Lying Is Not Rational </strong></p><p> Do you believe in SMORC? The Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC) says that we decide whether or not to lie or cheat based on an internal cost benefit analysis of 3 factors:</p><li> The benefit you gain by lying or committing a crime</li><li> The probability of getting caught</li><li> The extent of the expected punishment if you are caught <br/>  </li><p> In other words, we don&rsquo;t really think about what is moral or ethical; we decide to cheat or not based on a rational cost benefit analysis. If this were the case, the simple answer to curbing crime and lying would be to have extremely high punishments and lots of watchdogs&ndash;police, surveillance cameras and audits. But here&rsquo;s the problem. SMORC is false. Dan Ariely tested the SMORC principle in the lab and found that our cheating is not rational and has very little to do with a cost benefit analysis. Lying is not an internal struggle with pros and cons, it is an internal struggle about how you view yourself&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  2. I am NOT a Liar </strong></p><p> Remember when I called you a liar at the beginning of this article? Did that make you flinch? Mentally uncomfortable? Angry? We hate to think of ourselves as liars. Research about dishonesty finds that we have 2 conflicting impulses:</p><li> The desire to get ahead</li><li> The desire to think of ourselves as a good person <br/>  </li><p> Our survive and thrive instincts tell us to cheat, lie and steal to be on top of the food chain. But our communal instincts tell us to be an honest, kind and authentic person. So, while the threat of getting caught or a big punishment can dissuade us from telling the truth, our desire to be a good person is even more powerful. However, there are times when the reward for lying or cheating is higher than our desire to be a good person. And that&rsquo;s where the Fudge Factor comes in.</p><p> <strong>  3. The Fudge Factor </strong></p><p> In order to get the benefits of lying without the shame of feeling like a liar, our brain engages in some tricky rationalization and self-deception. The Fudge Factor is what we do when we allow ourselves to engage in small amounts of cheating or lying so we still feel like a good person. Ariely says it nicely, &ldquo;We cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self-image as reasonable honest individuals.&rdquo; In this way, we rationalize small amounts of lying without feeling too guilty. This is because we don&rsquo;t want to miss out on the small rewards cheating might give us, but at the end of the day we still want to be able to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good. The amount of cheating that happens is equal to the desire for gain minus the desire to be a good person.</p><li> The catch is we each have our own limit. For example, have you ever left a bowl of candy outside your door on Halloween and asked visitors to take &ldquo;Just one piece per trick or treater?&rdquo; If you want to see the failure of SMORC and the use of the Fudge Factor in action, I recommend you try it. Here&rsquo;s what will happen. Very few kids will only take one piece of candy. Most kids approach the bowl and take 2 pieces of candy&ndash;just one more than the &ldquo;rule.&rdquo; In this way, they get extra candy but don&rsquo;t feel too bad about themselves for doing it. Few kids will take 3 pieces and the occasional kid will dump the entire bowl into his bag. This is the perfect example of how we each have different limits on the Fudge Factor.</li><li> Here is another example of the Fudge Factor in action: <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4. What Makes Us Lie More </strong></p><p> There are certain things that make the Fudge Factor grow. Ariely found that when people feel distanced from the consequences they steal more. For example, using tokens instead of money distances people from feeling like they are actually stealing money, and they therefore take more. Ariely also found that when you remind someone of their past achievements (even if those are false) people steal more because they rationalize that they deserve it. Or perhaps their internal &lsquo;good person&rsquo; thermometer is already high, so stealing or cheating a little bit is ok&ndash;hence a larger Fudge Factor. If we think we can benefit others with our lies, we lie more. Altruistic motives make us feel that we are still good people so the Fudge Factor is larger. For example, if one trick-or-treater was getting candy for himself and his baby sister, he would be inclined to take even more candy from the bowl.</p><li> Take-Away: Beware of a cashless society. Credit cards, chips, tokens and representations of money increase the chances of having someone steal. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  5. What Makes Us Lie Less </strong></p><p> Luckily, there are a number of things we can do to encourage people to lie less. These center around reminding someone that they are a good person and the need for honesty should be upheld.</p><li> Take-Away: Use honor codes. When we have people sign honor codes they are less likely to cheat. This decreases the Fudge Factor because you are specifically asking someone to be a good person.</li><li> Take-Away: Remind people of their morality and the need for honesty. Having people sign a document before and after with an honesty pledge or stating to a group the need for honesty can help remind people of their own ethics.</li><li> Take-Away: Have people take an oath. When people state out loud the need for honesty, they are less likely to cheat.</li><li> Take-Away: When people think they are being watched, they cheat less. This goes back to SMORC which increases the potential for being caught. This even worked with a drawing of an eyeball&ndash;so no one was actually watching, but the eye had the implication of being watched. This reminded people of their desire to be a good person if viewed by others. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  6. Do Liars Have Higher IQ? </strong></p><p> When Ariely tested liars&rsquo; IQ, he found that liars are not smarter than non-liars. However, they are more creative. Really good liars are creative and strategic about both rationalization and self-deception. They can come up with (and believe) elaborate tales that both convince them of their morality and justify their lying (extreme Fudge Factor behavior ensues). The more creative a person, the more they tend to cheat. Ariely even found that when he primed average subjects to feel more creative, their lying behavior increased.</p><p> <strong>  7. The &ldquo;What the Hell Effect&rdquo; </strong></p><p> When someone has already cheated a little bit, they might have the tendency to keep going. In other words, they think &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already a cheater, so what the hell, I&rsquo;m going all the way.&rdquo; People who were told that they were wearing fake designer sunglasses while completing a challenge cheated more than people who were wearing genuine sunglasses (they were actually identical). Once someone thought they were already &lsquo;cheating&rsquo; by wearing fake sunglasses they cheated more on the task.</p><li> Take-Away: The Broken Windows Theory should apply to lying as well. Don&rsquo;t brush off one small lie. Once it starts, it&rsquo;s hard to stop it. Remind people of what makes them lie less&hellip; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  8. Interesting&hellip; </strong></p><p> Some other interesting findings about lying.</p><li> Ariely found that liars do feel guilty. In fact, liars who cheat more on a task end up giving themselves more electric shocks in a follow-up activity. It&rsquo;s almost as if they are punishing themselves for the cheating they just did.</li><li> Which country lies the most? Ariely found no difference across cultures. The average amount of lying on his tasks was the same in the US, Italy, China and beyond.</li><li> Which occupation lies the most? Ariely found that bankers cheated twice as much as politicians! <br/>  </li><p> Now that you know the science of lying, how are you going to encourage more honesty in your relationships?</p><p> <strong>  Want to learn to be a human lie detector? </strong></p><p> Check out our article on the  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/do-you-know-when-someone-is-lying-to-you-new/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   7 steps of deception detection  </u>  . </a></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://alexpirouz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Alex Pirouz  </u> </a> It may sound silly, but I guarantee you there are salespeople out there with what I call  Sales Phobia . In fact, you may know someone or have come across or even employed someone with this affliction.Indeed, you are probably also a sufferer (even if only mildly affected, at times of weakness).And here&rsquo;s the worst part. Because the seller feels uncomfortable about projecting the wrong image to customers, the customers in turn perceive and feel this level of discomfort.If this sounds like you or one of your employers, here are five steps to beat your affliction.Stop and think of it this way: if a salesperson is uncomfortable when taking the sale, then why should the client be comfortable making the payment? In my view there are two main reasons why this happens:&bull; Doubt: Salesperson is not sure if they have done a good enough job in selling the product/service.&bull; Fear: They fear that the customer won&rsquo;t buy from them or will reject them, after all the effort they have put in.With most salespeople, these beliefs have been conditioned deep in their subconscious throughout their career.It&rsquo;s important that if, or when, these beliefs suddenly manifest themselves, you acknowledge the fact, and know that the more you follow the following steps, the more quickly you will eliminate their effects.By keeping statistics of your sales, you will gain insight as to what your results are like in the following categories:&bull; % of customers who buy the first time&bull; % of clients that need multiple steps&bull; % that would buy after building rapport&bull; % that buy from you regardlessBy knowing your percentages, you will no longer have doubt, because your conversations will indicate where you are up to with each customer.The next important tip to remember when going for the close is to never, ever go for the payment before confirming the client&rsquo;s contact details, and recapping the main reasons why they wanted to buy in the first place. <strong>  THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR DOING THIS: </strong> &bull; Reinforce: Reinforce the main reasons why they wanted the product in the first place, bringing this to the front of their mind once more.&bull; Double-check their contact details: In sales, the more small YES answers you get before you ask for the big YES, the greater your chance of closing.&bull; Build more rapport: Opportunity to use third-party verification and testimonials to establish more of a need for your product/service.Now that you have made sure the client details are right, reinforced their main reasons for purchase and built more rapport, it&rsquo;s time to ask for payment. And when asking for payment, always give the client three options. <strong>  WHY? </strong> 1. When clients have one option, they have no option.2. When they have two options, they have a dilemma.3. When they have three options, they have choice.4. When they have four options, they have too many to choose from.Make sure the product/service you are selling has three options.Another thing to remember when asking for payment is to make sure both yourself and your client are in peak emotional states. Research has shown that when people are in a high positive emotional state, they tend to buy more.And finally when you&rsquo;re asking for payment, you need to ask a question which is designed to encourage their taking action now! The one question that has worked really well for my clients and me has been:So how would you like to pay for that? With Visa, MasterCard, or Amex?Take a moment now to think about how you want to structure your questions!The question is structured in a way that will give the client three options to choose from, and it is also assumptive. We are not asking if they would like to pay for it, we are assuming they are going to pay.At the time of close, most salespeople think: I&rsquo;ve made the sale and that&rsquo;s the end of it.In fact it&rsquo;s only the beginning of the relationship.When a client buys from you, another sale starts. This is your chance to sell the client why they should continue to buy from you, rather than forget all about you, and go somewhere else next time.These days too much time and money is spent acquiring new customers rather than looking after pre-existing clients.If you look after and pamper your existing customers, they will turn into raving fans, and your sales will mostly be coming from referrals. So stop spending so much time trying to get new sales, and go and contact the clients who purchased from you before. <strong>  Here are some final tips: </strong> &bull; Touch base with them at least once a month&bull; Remember their birthdays, and send them a card at the very least&bull; Do not sell them every time you call them; the ratio of sale to contact should be 1:3&bull; Remember their main values, and particulars of interest (kids, whether they were about to move, and other such personal particulars)&bull; Get testimonials from themAnytime you make a sale, you should think of that client as a client for life. Do whatever it takes to go beyond the call of duty to look after this client, and it will pay dividends. It&rsquo;s the smallest things that make the biggest differences. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Six weeks ago, my business book was released.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Do-Less-Better-Strategic-Sacrifice/dp/1137452773/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423441336&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=do+less+better\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Do Less Better. The Power of Strategic Sacrifice in a Complex World  </a> </u>  concerns itself with focus and simplicity. In it, I draw on personal experiences from my days in the C-suite and the boardrooms of my consulting clients to make the case that sacrifice is the surprising secret to successful long-term viability. Business complexity has never been greater, but it is not the phenomenon itself but rather the inability to cut through the clutter that comes in the way of resurrecting clarity and coherence <br/> <br/> In the weeks following the release, I&rsquo;ve had several challenging questions about the concept from podcast interviewers and traditional journalists. One of the more biting ones was how doing less better impacts the organization&rsquo;s average Joe or Jane. This question concerns itself with activities at sea level, not up there in the stratosphere where corporate strategy is crafted <br/> <br/> I say that &ldquo;focus touches every department and every employee in well-run do less better companies.&rdquo; I suggest that the &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list is a good place to set the stage for a do less better mindset. You need a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list. Your boss needs a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list. So does the President of the United States. But understand that the list&rsquo;s effectiveness is in direct proportion to the number of items on the list. Fewer projects = bigger impact <br/> <br/> <strong>  Know what is essential.  <br/>  <br/>  Know what to delete from your screen, and when to move on.  <br/>  <br/>  Know what will bring the greatest return on effort. This is your personal ROE ratio. </strong> <br/> <br/> Sure, there are menial tasks that we all must do. If they consume 75% of your day, prioritize the other 25%. Some people set up their lists according to operational and strategic projects. Some differentiate by the value of the task. Some establish goals based on what they can do really well. For example, should a blogger go for quantity or quality of posts? Is a daily post that&rsquo;s been slapped together in a half hour better than a weekly post of insightful, engaging content that might take days to research and write? The answer depends on the blogger&rsquo;s objectives and his or her working style. <br/> <br/> When I was a CEO, one of my marketing managers made a request to hire an extra brand manager. Credit to him for his courage; he was well aware of my distaste for adding employees. My belief, then and now, is that the greater the number of employees, the greater the corporate complexity. Anyway, he said his project list had reached a point that precluded him from doing the kind of job he wanted to do. He believed that the recruitment of an assistant would make all the difference. I asked him to update his project list and organize it, beginning with the most important and ending with least important projects. The following day, he brought me the list <br/> <br/> We discussed the projects, and when satisfied that I understood the twenty or so items on his page, I scratched out the bottom third of them. &ldquo;Stop working on these,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do you think you can manage the rest without that assistant?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Of course he could. Okay, I&rsquo;ve simplified the interaction but not the part about scratching out a third of the projects. Ultimately, that marketing manager became far more effective and far more motivated by doing the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dolessbetter.ca/press.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   work that matters  </a> </u> . Properly deployed, do less better is a winning strategy for employees, customers, and shareholders <br/>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Robin Powell  </u> </a></p><p> As a journalist working in the financial industry I never enjoy reading those surveys that rank the trustworthiness of different professions. Every time, it seems, firefighters and paramedics take the plaudits while journalists and financial professionals invariably finish near the bottom.</p><p> It came as little surprise, then, that in the latest Reader&rsquo;s Digest  Who do we trust?  survey, New Zealanders ranked financial planners 40th out of 49, just three places ahead of journalists and seven ahead of sex workers.</p><p> The fact that they&rsquo;re considered far less trustworthy than hairdressers and mechanics (with the greatest respect to both of those noble professions) should be of major concern to financial advisers. The good news is that new research suggests that, to most advisers, it clearly is.</p><p> In a survey of 110 financial planners and wealth managers in Australasia, Europe and North America, 90% identified establishing trust with clients and prospective clients as a key marketing objective for 2015. Their second biggest priority is investor education.</p><p> The research, by Birmingham Business School, also revealed an interesting change of emphasis in companies&rsquo; marketing strategies. Asked which form of marketing they considered the most effective, more than half went for content. Events and seminars were rated the next most effective, ahead of printed materials and press releases.</p><p> For someone like me who has long advocated the use of high-quality and engaging content for advisers looking to build trust and to attract and retain more clients, this is a welcome development.</p><p> Your content &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s videos, blogs, infographics or, better still, a combination of those &ndash; should reflect who you are and what your values are. It&rsquo;s largely your online presence, and particularly your content, that points potential clients towards your company in the first place. Referring leads to relevant content is a great way to follow up after your initial meeting. And once they become clients, you can use content to keep them informed and engaged.</p><p> A more worrying finding from the Birmingham study is that financial planners are becoming less convinced of the value of social media. Advisers have never been prolific users of the likes of Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, and now it seems that many of those who have used social media are scaling back.</p><p> That surely a mistake. Social media is precisely where clients and prospective clients are. Not being there alongside them makes very little sense.</p><p> The essential point is that content and social media need each other. You can have the best content, but if not enough people in your target demographic see your insightful videos, your beautiful infographics or your word-perfect blog, you&rsquo;ve wasted precious time and resources.</p><p> Social media is the how you direct your content to the people you want to see it and engage with it. It&rsquo;s also how you share other people&rsquo;s content &ndash; and that too is crucial to building trust.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The Dark Ages. </strong></p><p> For those who are not familiar with the medieval history, medieval refers to a period of paralyzing technological degradation. A time when no Amazon.com. No Netflix. No Hulu. No radio Spotify or Pandora or Sirius. During the Middle Ages, consumers did not receive recommendations based on your previous custom shop. Also receive personalized recommendations for new music, movies or TV shows based on what they had heard and seen. In fact, to see their favorite TV shows, people had to \"tune in\" at specific times. Presumably, the television industry was creating content for us.However, if you ever wanted to see, we had to do it in their schedules.</p><p> <strong>  It really was a dark time. </strong></p><p> OK, so my medieval story might be a bit off. But my underlying point here is that people prefer - and often crave - personalized experiences. And by \"personalized experience\", I mean an interaction or coupling with a piece of software, a piece of content, or a person (duh) that leaves you feeling that your interests and preferences were actually being taken into account.</p><p> Personalization is as if someone gives you a fitted baseball cap with the logo of your favorite team on the front and your initials sewn on one side.</p><p> By contrast, no customization is as if someone gives a whole one-size-cabez&oacute;n baseball cap with any team you hate logo on the front. No initials. No consideration for their preferences of any kind.It is like the person who gave you bought a 48-pack of baseball caps on Amazon and they were just one of many \"lucky\" beneficiaries.</p><p> Fortunately, modern (non-Dark Ages) technology allows us to take advantage of customization than ever before. For example, as in sales, we can now customize our home pages, landing pages, forms, calls to action (CTA), and email messages so that the content and messages we show always adapted the person browsing on it.</p><p> However, if you want to learn more about why people crave customization on a psychological level, just keep reading and I'll do my best to explain it.</p><p> <strong>  Why we prefer personalized experiences? </strong></p><p> According to a study from the University of Texas, we can attribute our preference for personalized experiences to two key factors: the desire for control and information overload. Let us \"desire to control\" first.</p><p> So we know that a customized experience - by nature - is somewhat different manner to the current situation. It's not just what everyone else is doing with personalization. Instead, you are getting something to suit you. And because of that, you feel more in control.</p><p> Truth be told, are not actually making a choice when, for example, can see custom content on a website. But when you know you are getting something that suits their interests, even perceived to have a certain level of control over what you're committing to.</p><p> Even if this sense of control is an illusion, it is still powerful, and can have a positive effect on your psyche. According to Psychology Today, people feel a sense of internal control - ie they think they are in control of their life outcomes, rather than believing external forces are responsible - tend to be healthier and physiologically more success.</p><p> Now, let us turn to the second factor mentioned in the study at the University of Texas: information overload.</p><p> According to the study, another reason why we prefer personalized experiences is because they help reduce information overload. Or, more precisely, customization can help reduce our perception of information overload.</p><p> For example, when you know that the content displayed on a web page suits you, which provides a more manageable framework for engagement. With customization, not presented with thousands of resources to sort and consume. Instead, you are - ideally - present exactly the information you were looking for. Therefore, you will never feel \"overloaded\" with information.</p><p> <strong>  Relevance to the rescue </strong></p><p> Of course, the idea that customization can satisfy our collective desire for control, as well as our desire to reduce information overload, applies only when we know that personalization is really happening.</p><p> Think about this: If there are no obvious signs of customization (like seeing your name on the sign of an email), how can even say that something has been customized?</p><p> In those cases - when someone is not aware that they are participating with customized content - feelings of control and reducing information overload not come into play. Yet, research (including this study) confirms that people prefer customization, even if they are not aware that they are experiencing.</p><p> So why, speaking in psychology, is what still like best custom content in these cases? Simple: It's relevant. And, as humans, we are naturally more inclined to engage with information that we find relevant and interesting.</p><p> <strong>  Not satisfied with that answer? Me neither. Let's go a little deeper. </strong></p><p> You see, everything has to do with the reticular activating system of the brain, or RAS (which, FYI, is number 7 on my list of \"Top 10 Favorite Activation System\"). Moving on ...</p><p> Your RAS is the gateway passes the information to reach your brain, and that information is filtered so you know what to pay attention. Have you heard of \"selective attention\" or \"selective hearing\"? This ability to focus on one bit of information, regardless while other information, is controlled by the RAS.</p><p> As Dr. Rachna Jain once noted in an article in Social Media Examiner about the psychological influence, \"Usually, the RAS is associated with the concept of selective attention, which means that naturally orient to information or ideas that are invested in. \"</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/reticular_activating_system.jpg\" width=\"650\"/></p><p> (Image source: howourbrainswork.com)</p><h3> One of the most common examples of RAS in action is known as the \"cocktail effect\". Here's how it works: <br/>  </h3><p> If you're at a party with dozens of people chatting around you, you will probably find that you can ignore or disconnect from those conversations easily. They are nothing more than background noise. But as soon as someone says something that is of particular interest to you, magically you want to tune in to that particular conversation. Important information is, thanks to its RAS, rise above the noise.</p><p> Want to know one of - if not the - greatest \"cocktail effect\" triggered about? Let's explore that next.</p><p> <strong>  The sweet sound </strong></p><p> \"Remember the name of a person, that person, sweetest and most important sound in any language.\" &mdash; Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People</p><p> Carnegie's point here was to remember the name of a person - and use it when appropriate - is key to winning this person to your way of thinking. He was so interested in this idea, in fact, that he came up with his own system for remembering names effectively.</p><p> Clearly, Carnegie understood that something special happens when people hear their own name. And, as alluded to in the previous paragraph, the \"cocktail effect\" also supports this idea: Your name, as it turns out, is one of the easiest sounds for your RAS to tune in.</p><p> While you can easily ignore that stranger in the background complaining about their work or discuss your kitchen renovations, as soon as his name is mentioned, your ears will inevitably come alive.</p><p> So what exactly is going on here? My scientific answer is:</p><p> Something. Definitely, something is happening. And yes, there is a scientific research that supports my bold claim.</p><p> According to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain Research, when people hear their own name (compared to hear other names), not a single reaction in the brain.</p><p> More specifically, hearing his own name - unlike other names - triggers increased brain activation, particularly in the medial frontal cortex (associated with social behavior), the middle and superior temporal cortex (which is associated with long term memory and auditory processing, respectively), and the cuneus (which is associated with visual processing).</p><p> Based on this research, it is clear to hear his own name certainly makes something special happens in your brain. But how can you use this information to improve practice marketing?</p><p> Easy! Start using dynamic labels in their lead nurturing emails so you can cope with the recipients by name. You can also greet returning customers by name on your page. With intelligent content, the sky is the limit.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Alan Watson </u></p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the difference between inbound and outbound marketing and why should it make a difference to your business? </strong></p><p> You don&rsquo;t have a month to read everything that&rsquo;s ever been written about the difference and believe me, there have been virtual forests removed on this one. So I&rsquo;ll be as brief as my understanding will let me.</p><p> <strong>  Inbound vs Outbound Marketing : definitions </strong></p><p> Outbound Marketing  is the good old fashioned way where a company starts the conversation and sends out its message to its target audience.</p><p> Inbound Marketing  is the new way that attracts the target audience to come to you. You earn the attention of your target audience, make yourself easy to find and bring prospects to your website with good content.</p><p> So knowing who your target audience is will often dictate which type of marketing is most appropriate. Outbound is favoured by many traditionalists and includes things like :</p><li> Press releases</li><li> Trade shows</li><li> Direct mail</li><li> TV &amp; Radio ads</li><li> Newspaper ads</li><li> Cold calling <br/>  </li><p> The prevalence of the online world has meant that Outbound has lost a lot of its popularity. Cold calling and display advertising are seen by many as now outdated. However, if your client is from an older generation, then they are more likely to respond better to Outbound marketing tactics.</p><p> Inbound is favoured by younger generations or the tomorrow people (but not exclusively), as they have been raised in the internet world. They have become used to un-intrusive advertisements and learned to fast forward TV commercials whenever the mood takes them. Inbound is the modern way to market online and includes things like :</p><li> SEO &ndash; maximising the chances of being seen by your target audience online</li><li> Ebooks &ndash; high value information being sought by your audience</li><li> Social Media &ndash; intelligent use of LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter to distribute your blogs and engage.</li><li> Webinars &ndash; online presentations (Live or recorded) to help generate interest</li><li> Blogs &ndash; where you talk about you, your business, your industry and your opinions <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Best Use Of Inbound Marketing </strong></p><p> This is primarily an online marketing strategy and should be used if a business has an online presence. This strategy is also much more cost effective in lead generation. In many circumstances more than 50% less cost / lead is seen using Inbound vs Outbound marketing. The tomorrow people get this.</p><p> <strong>  The Tomorrow People Action Plan </strong></p><p> In summary, we have covered two approaches to marketing your business to generate new leads, but our recommendation to small businesses is to take up the Inbound approach from a cost point of view.</p><li> The new modern way is to get a well designed, mobile friendly website which you populate with great, relevant content for your target audience.</li><li> Ensure you make the site friendly for the Search Engines and your target audience will be able to find you. </li><li> Get active on distributing your content on Social Media. </li><li> Lastly, give away something of value in exchange for contact details and start building a relationship through email campaigns. <br/>  </li><p> If you have a big budget and want some technology assistance to implement, then talk to us about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this  </a> </u> .</p><p> On the other hand, if you count every penny that walks out the door, then talk to us about a very cost effective and highly credible  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.freestone-business.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   alternative.  </a> </u>  We&rsquo;ll be only too happy to  engage !</p>  ",

    "content": "<p> Which do you think is more effective with todays educated and sophisticated consumer?</p><p> 1. Clever sales technique that has you taking the dominant position and &ldquo;winning&rdquo;, or,</p><p> 2. Pre-empting the predictable typical human behaviour and giving them what they are most likely to want up-front, most of the time?</p><p> Nobody likes being in the &ldquo;winner-loser&rdquo; game of hardcore sales pitches other than those who just love winning at anything, anytime, anywhere and against anyone.</p><p> When you have a genuine prospect &ndash; a potential future client &ndash; who is checking you out and wondering whether to choose you or the other guy just down the road, you can make it easy for the prospect to say &ldquo;YES&rdquo; and choose you if you understand the 4 fundamentals that virtually all prospects are wanting ideally.  As well as understanding these essentials, it is important to cover them in the correct sequence.</p><p> 1. Expectations.</p><p> 2. Value.</p><p> 3. Convenience</p><p> 4. Safety.</p><p> The first is simply a ticket to the game&hellip;.it is the entry level concern of the prospect.  You need to assure the prospect of your technical and professional expertise, and demonstrate your credentials.  It is a simple (and relatively quick) step, but it is a pre-requisite to then being able to move on to the other areas with credibility and a degree of trust.</p><p> Articulating the value that the prospect receives follows as that gets straight to addressing the &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; question, which is the dominant thought.  Until it is addressed nothing else matters really as far as most prospective clients are concerned.</p><p> With professional credibility and clear client value demonstrated it is then necessary to move into the realm of making it easy for the client to say yes.  Discussing the convenience factors is the logical next step as it supports the value proposition&hellip;in some respects the convenience factors are an extension of the value for the client.</p><p> The final step is to try and make the decision a safe one for the client &ndash; remove risk from the equation for them so their is no reason to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Choosing you becomes the proverbial No-Brainer&hellip;no real thought is necessary.</p><p> Here is a quick example in bullet point form ( very brief! ) of how that comes together in a thoughtfully structured approach:</p><li> my qualifications&hellip;.</li><li> areas I specialise in&hellip;.</li><li> the work I do for clients like you&hellip;</li><li> results/outcomes/benefits are&hellip;.</li><li> which means clients get&hellip;..</li><li> we make things as hassle-free as possible for clients by doing/delivering/helping&hellip;..</li><li> and we try to take as much risk out of it for clients by providing guarantee/free something or other/structuring things a certain way&hellip;.</li><p> This process moves between addressing the logical or rationale decision-making points together with addressing key emotional drivers&hellip;.rational&hellip;.emotional&hellip;.rational&hellip;.and finally emotional again.  It should go without saying however these bullet points demonstrate the structure only. The actual expression of the value you provide, or the convenience factors for example, need to be thought about carefully in advance and they need to be genuine and pertinent to the prospects.</p><p> The process does pre-empt the typical questions and concerns and supports the logic of why you are the right choice together with openly addressing typical fears and uncertainties, and will make it a no-brainer for most people most of the time to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to working with you.</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Is your company committing the 7 Deadly Sins of customer experience? </strong> <br/> <br/> Recently, my kids asked me about the 7 Deadly Sins; I don't remember how the topic came up, but when they ask, I answer. Of course, as I ran down the list and explained them (in a PG kind of way), I pondered sins of the customer experience. <br/> <br/> I guess that put me on a 7 Deadly Sins kick. I just hosted a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.touchpointdashboard.com/2015/02/7-deadly-sins-of-journey-mapping/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   webinar  </a> </u>  about the 7 Deadly Sins of Journey Mapping. I'll take a broader stroke in this post and look at customer experience management overall.  <br/> <br/> The 7 Deadly Sins are mortal sins (as opposed to minor sins) and are considered to be the root of all other sins. If you commit these sins, failure is certain. Are there more than seven sins in customer experience? Yes, probably. But I think these are the most egregious; if you are guilty of these, you won't successfully transform the customer experience for the better. <br/> <br/> So, without further ado, the 7 Sins are, in no particular order (although #1 is probably #1)...  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. No executive commitment </strong> <br/> Probably the biggest Sin to commit is to think you can transform anything without executive buy-in. If company leadership isn't on board with focusing on the customer, then forget it; it won't happen. Oh sure, you might have localized or departmentalized efforts, but those will be silo'd efforts that translate to silo'd experiences for the customer. Without executive commitment, you'll never get resources - human, capital, or other - to execute on your customer experience strategy. <br/> <br/> Some posts I've written related to this Sin include:  <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/10/kicking-cx-can-down-road.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kicking the #CX Can Down the Road  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/09/help-my-execs-dont-get-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Help! My Execs Don't Get It!  </a> </u> <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Lack of CX vision and strategy </strong> <br/> Following up to my last statement regarding executive commitment, you must, of course, have a customer experience vision and strategy. CX Strategy refers to your approach to delivering a great customer experience. It's your plan or direction. Your strategy outlines how you're going to achieve the goal of delivering a great customer experience.  <br/> <br/> Without a vision and a strategy, you can't achieve your goals, and your employees can't deliver a great experience. Without knowing what you're delivering, it's really hard to execute! If leaders don't define the vision, communicate the brand promise, and outline what success looks like, employees can't be expected to deliver on it. <br/> <br/> A post I wrote related to this Sin: <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/07/is-your-customer-experience-suffering.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Is Your Customer Experience Suffering from Short-Sightedness  </a> </u> <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Failing to outline a governance structure </strong> <br/> Without a governance structure in place, we perpetuate silo thinking and fail to achieve cross-functional alignment, involvement, and commitment. Why? Because a governance structure outlines people, roles, and responsibilities when it comes to your customer experience strategy. Who is going to ensure that there is alignment and accountability across the organization? We often see this piece of the governance structure refer to a core program team, an executive sponsor, and cross-functional champions. Your oversight committee should include the team of people you believe will best carry out the strategy, driven by your corporate and customer experience vision, for your organization. <br/> <br/> You'll need to have clearly-defined rules and guidelines for how the customer experience management strategy will be executed. Who will drive the efforts and how? How will you transform to a customer-centric culture? How will organizational buy-in be achieved? How do you continue to motivate employees to focus on the customer? How will you listen to customers? Who will use the data and how? Where does accountability lie? What processes and policies must be in place in order to roll out these efforts? How will change management be handled? How will you measure success? How does it all tie in to our desired business outcomes?  <br/> <br/> A post I wrote related to this Sin: <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/10/are-you-flying-by-seat-of-your-cx-pants.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Are You Flying by the Seat of Your #CX Pants?   </a> </u> <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Not understanding - and listening to - your customers </strong> <br/> You can't transform something you don't understand. Included in that \"understanding\" is not only the current state of the experience but also (especially) the customer himself. Who is he? <br/> <br/> Do you know - really know - who your customers are? They might be partners, resellers, and/or end customers/users. Why do they buy products and services from you? What are their needs? What problems are they trying to solve? What are they trying to achieve? And how do they feel about how you are performing or how you are meeting their needs? I'm talking about personas, journey mapping, and voice of the customer. <br/> <br/> Some posts I've written related to this Sin include:  <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/05/whats-cost-of-listening-to-customers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What's the Cost of Listening to Customers?  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/06/does-it-pay-to-listen-to-voice-of.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Does It Pay to Listen to the Voice of the Customer?  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/04/do-you-know-who-your-customers-are.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Do You Know Who Your Customers Are?  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/01/customer-driven-transformation-via.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Customer-Driven Transformation via Walking in Customers&rsquo; Shoes  </a> </u>   <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Not acting on what your customers tell you </strong> <br/> This one is simple: You can't listen to your customers and then not act on what they're telling you. How disappointing! It's wrong on so many levels! <br/> <br/> Are you making improvements based on customers' feedback? Are you letting customers know what you've done as a result of their feedback? You must! And if you don't, then you're missing a huge opportunity, for a variety of reasons. <br/> <br/> Some posts I've written related to this Sin include:  <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/04/tips-to-help-you-close-loop-with-your.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tips to Help You Close the Loop with Your Customers   </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/07/transforming-customer-experience-with.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Transforming the Customer Experience with Big Data   </a> </u> <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Making the employee experience an afterthought </strong> <br/> ... or not thinking about it at all. <br/> <br/> Why? Because we know that the employee experience drives the customer experience. It's called the  spillover effect , or &ldquo;the tendency of one person&rsquo;s emotions to affect how other people around him feel.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> I like to quote this  <u>  <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/801.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1999 article from Harvard Business School's Working Knowledge  </a> </u>  that summarizes the work Sears executives did to rebuild the company to focus on customers.

Imagine: their model is data-based! <br/> <br/> Some posts I've written related to this Sin include: <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/04/its-time-to-focus-on-employee.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   It's Time to Focus on Employee Experience  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/03/putting-employees-more-first.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Putting Employees More First  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/06/does-employees-more-first-disparage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Does \"Employees More First\" Disparage Customers?  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/12/define-your-employee-centric-culture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Define Your Employee-Centric Culture  </a> </u> <br/>    <br/> <strong>  7. Perpetuating inside-out thinking </strong> <br/> Inside-out thinking means your focus is on processes that are designed and implemented based on internal thinking and intuition. The customer's needs and perspectives do not play a part in this type of thinking. You make decisions because you think it's what's best for the business. <br/> <br/> On the other hand, outside-in thinking means that you look at your business from the customer's perspective and subsequently design processes and make decisions based on what's best for the customer and what meets the customer's needs. You make decisions because you know it's what's best for your customers. <br/> <br/> Some posts I've written related to this Sin include:   <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/05/the-problem-with-inside-out-thinking.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Problem with Inside-Out Thinking  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/09/are-your-customers-persona-non-grata.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Are Your Customers Persona Non Grata?  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/06/building-customer-centric-culture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Building a Customer-Centric Culture  </a> </u> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/12/five-key-questions-to-ask-to-achieve.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Five Key Questions to Ask to Achieve a Customer-Centric Culture  </a> </u> <br/> <br/> Which of these Sins is your company guilty of? <br/> <br/> Everything starts with the customer . -Louis XIV</p>",

    "title": "4 Reasons Why Financial Advisor Websites Struggle",
    "link": "4-reasons-why-financial-advisor-websites-struggle",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There&rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than investing in an amazing looking advisor website only to suffer from a lack of website traffic and visitor engagement. Here are 4 reasons and actionable tips you can use to help solve this very common yet solvable problem.</p><p> <strong>  Reason 1: Not enough content and pages </strong></p><p> The old saying of quality over quantity does still matter in the world of digital marketing but many advisor websites I&rsquo;ve reviewed lack a volume of web pages and content, and by content I mean words, images and video. Not enough content implies not enough keywords and not enough pages leads to low page views and low engagement. Search engines require &ldquo;food&rdquo; and need to be given the chance to figure out whether your content is useful and relevant. Simply adding more content is an effective way to increase your site&rsquo;s traffic.</p><p> ACTION: Add more content. I know, seems obvious. Avoid adding content for the sake of adding content. Really think through what you are missing on your website. Have you told the complete story of your practice? Your philosophy? How you engage with your clients? How you solve you client&rsquo;s most mind boggling problems? If after your assessment you feel as though you have told the complete story, consider  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/start-your-advisor-blog-in-3-easy-steps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   starting a blog  </a> </u> . Blogging is the web&rsquo;s most effective way to generate organic traffic to websites.</p><p> <strong>  Reason 2: Poor Site Flow </strong></p><p> One of the things that make a dancer a good dancer is that their movements follow a logical and progressive pattern and flow. The same logical and progressive pattern is required of any good website. Many advisor websites that I&rsquo;ve seen have &ldquo;dead ends&rdquo; &mdash; a place where visitors are not given a choice to continue their journey within the website. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that your visitors may not always start their visit from the home page. An easy way to determine whether your website has poor site flow would be to take a look at your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/financial-advisor-website-analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bounce rates  </a> </u>  and your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/financial-advisor-website-analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   time on site  </a> </u> . Websites with poor site flow tend to have really poor  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/financial-advisor-website-analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  bounce rates </a>  (a bounce rate greater than 50% would be classified as poor) and have visitors who spend seconds instead of minutes on a website.</p><p> ACTION: Add more  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/3-reasons-advisors-need-calls-to-action-on-their-website/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   calls to action  </a> </u>  on your website. Thinking about your website from the perspective of calls to action will force you to think logically about your website&rsquo;s flow. A call to action provides your visitor with direction and it provides you with a number of different progression points for the visitor. It must be logical and it must be related to the content on your web page. For example, let&rsquo;s say you think of a call to action that asks your visitor to &ldquo;Schedule an assessment of their RRSP investment mix&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s a logical path to that call to action? It could be, 1) Visitor enters by searching for some tips on effectively saving for retirement, 2) Visitor likes the article and decides to look at what your practice does with respect to Retirement Savings advice and 3) Visitor sees your call to action to schedule an assessment and clicks on it and submits their contact information (first name, last name, email, etc.). Think about what your calls to action will be and plan out the path to get there!</p><p> <strong>  Reason 3: Your Value Proposition is all about You </strong></p><p> Writing a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/4-secrets-to-writing-an-effective-value-proposition-for-financial-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   solid value proposition  </a> </u>  can be a challenging and time consuming task. I&rsquo;ve read a significant number of different value propositions and the most common mistake I run into is the fact that value propositions are always about the advisor or the practice. Very seldom does it ever speak to the visitor. Remember, the first goal of your website is to provide enough incentive for the visitor to click again. That&rsquo;s it. When someone visits you for the first time or is trying to learn more about you they are trying to figure out how you can help them and not so much about how great you are (that comes later).</p><p> ACTION: Re-evaluate your value proposition. Does it speak to your visitors? Does it clearly indicate the problems you help them solve? Or does it talk about what you do and how many awards you&rsquo;ve received? If you need more tips on writing an effective value proposition, take a look at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/4-secrets-to-writing-an-effective-value-proposition-for-financial-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this blog post  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Reason 4: Where did all the Keywords go? </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-search-engine-optimization-seo-and-why-do-i-need-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SEO  </a> </u>  is critical. With the sheer volume of content that exists on the web, advisors can no longer afford to launch their online brand without knowledge or consideration of Search Engine Optimization. Advisors don&rsquo;t need to be experts in SEO, but they should understand a the key fundamental aspects of SEO that will help their website rank in a Google or Bing search. Many advisor websites I&rsquo;ve reviewed have volumes of content, however, there aren&rsquo;t enough long tail keywords on the page. Before defining a long tail keyword, let&rsquo;s define &ldquo;keyword&rdquo;. A keyword is defined as a word or concept of great significance. For example, &ldquo;apple&rdquo;. In search, keywords are used to match search queries, for example, &ldquo;what is an apple?&rdquo;. Search engines, attempt to match queries with keywords as a part of their ranking algorithm. Content containing common keywords puts you in a more competitive search rank scenario. For example, doing a search on &ldquo;Andrew Chung&rdquo; brings up a ton of other &ldquo;Andrew Chung&rdquo; in the world and puts me in a very competitive search competition. Taking the same example, doing a search on &ldquo;Andrew Chung Veriday&rdquo;, puts me right at the top. This is an example of a long tail keyword. Even though it still contains &ldquo;Andrew Chung&rdquo; (a very common keyword), appending &ldquo;Veriday&rdquo; to the end of it makes it unique and enables you to rank high for that particular search. Best practices in keyword optimization state that using your audience&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/write-your-content-using-plainspoken-language/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   common language  </a> </u>  is critical to your keyword strategy.</p><p> ACTION: As a start, look at the headings in your content; these are typically titles that have a larger size than your regular text. Are these keywords relevant to your practice? Are they written in your target audience&rsquo;s language? Are the headings too common (for example &ldquo;Our Practice&rdquo; is too common)? Take the 5-10 weakest headings and simply re-write them or enhance them with long-tail keywords relevant to the financial advice industry and your business.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Evan Bue  </u> </a>  </p><p> Let&rsquo;s begin with a few questions:</p><li> Would we be less productive if we sat down for every meal?</li><li> How late would we be if we couldn&rsquo;t pick up breakfast on the way to work?</li><li> How many phone calls would we miss if we had to wait for lunch to be prepared, cooked, served, and savored?</li><p> Many of us could probably answer these questions and conclude our lives would be less productive were it not for the convenience of fast food and to-go options.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s proliferation of fast-food restaurants meets a growing demand. Time is a precious commodity, and efficiency is the name of today&rsquo;s market game.</p><p> But a  <u>  report </u>  by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.asyousow.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   As You Sow  </a> </u>  and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Natural Resources Defense Council  </a> </u>  recently concluded that an industry characterized by its efficiency &mdash;fast food &mdash;is actually profoundly inefficient. How can this be?</p><p> While this blog can&rsquo;t replace the comprehensiveness of the report, it would be good to elaborate &mdash; recycle, if you will &mdash; a few points for general consumption.</p><p> The problem is twofold: environmental and economic. According to the report, published in January 2015, the fast food, beverage, and grocery store industries could dramatically improve the way they handle waste. Analyzing the packaging practices of 47 businesses, the report calculated that $11.4 billion of recyclable materials are thrown away each year. And while some companies waste less than others, none have reached best practice packaging efficiencies. </p><p> Jumping to the economic point, better recycling practices have the potential to create jobs. It is estimated that if the U.S. national recycling rate reached 75 percent by the year 2030 (the current U.S. recycling rate is at 34.5 percent), nearly 1.5 million additional jobs would be created. That&rsquo;s in addition to the $32 billion in revenue generated by the 137,000 people already employed by recycling and manufacturing companies.</p><p> Thinking of trash as a circular commodity can help put things in perspective. Defined more broadly, a circular economy uses the waste from one business and turns into the feedstock of another. The disposal of reusable materials is a failure of market and foresight; it&rsquo;s safe to say the market at large hasn&rsquo;t realized the economic potential of more robust recycling programs.</p><p> But we at Ecova have, and we&rsquo;re working to help businesses realize their own potential. Our Total Waste Solution package reduces clients&rsquo; overall waste production while simultaneously increasing recycling opportunities. The result is an average reduction of 15 to 20 percent of overall waste costs.</p><p> Ecova and the report, then, shed light on cost savings, environmental stewardship, and market improvement via  <u>  waste and recycling management </u> . We hope you don&rsquo;t dispose of the potential such initiatives have, and recycle the knowledge into valuable action.</p><p> To learn more about energy management savings opportunities for the New Year, watch our recent webinar on our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/news-media/webinars/inside-energy-sustainability-webinars.aspx?id=71gy9c1qtx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Energy &amp; Sustainability Priorities and Predictions  </a> </u> .</p><p> Related content:</p><li> <u>  Blog Post: Many Means to Mitigating Waste Management Costs </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/solutions/ecova-technology/ecova-platform.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Demo: Ecova Energy and Sustainability Management Platform  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  Solution: Waste Management </u></li>",

    "content": "<strong> As technology advances with the development of smart watches, let&rsquo;s go back for a change and look at time keeping from the beginning&hellip;</strong>For almost as long as humans have walked the Earth, the methods used to measure time have changed dramatically. Countless theories regarding inventions, dates, and even inventors exist, but some significant milestones mark our fascination with recording the passage of time.<img alt=\"\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1_7.png\" width=\"1024\"/>Image via <u> <a href=\"http://crlt.deviantart.com/art/Stonehenge-156998726\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CrLT </a></u> (DeviantArt)Once humans recognized the difference between day and night, moon phases were used to mark months, and later the changing seasons were observed to record years. After noticing the connection with the sun&rsquo;s position, people used shadows to track sunny hours; hence, the sundial was invented. Some believe Stonehenge is the most monumental of early sundial structures. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks later designed obelisks presumably for the same reason.<img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2_clepsydra_by_andrewpershin-d4s4xq9.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>Image via <u> <a href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/art/clepsydra-289124289\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AndrewPershin </a></u>Life became more complex and the ability to keep time accurately became necessary. As early as 325 BC, the Greeks invented water clocks or &lsquo;clepsydras&rsquo;. The water flows from one container to another at a steady rate, and the passing of time is read using markings on the outside of the container. In 1000 AD, mechanical parts were invented to power the water clock, which eventually lead to the concept of the mechanical clock.The first mechanical clock, one of the greatest technological achievements in history, was invented in England. The exact date of the first clock, as well as the name of its inventor, remains a mystery. Today the only existing clocks that predate 1300 are the cathedral clocks at St. Paul&rsquo;s in London and in Canterbury, believed to have been built around 1275.<img alt=\"\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3-Pocket.jpg\" width=\"640\"/>Image via <u> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/donpezzano/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Don Urban </a></u> (Flickr)As the Middle Ages end and the Renaissance was born, cultural developments brought new interest in clocks, which lead to a great variety of portable models. When clocks were small enough to carry in one&rsquo;s pocket, the timepieces became known as watches. During the 16th century, springs replaced weights inside clocks and delivered greater accuracy. The spring-powered pocket watch was one of the first status symbols popular among Europe&rsquo;s tastemakers because of its size and astronomical price.<img alt=\"\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-Christiaan_Huygens_Clock_and_Horologii_Oscillatorii-1024x492.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/>Image via WikiGalileo Galilei is credited with inventing the pendulum-clock concept; however, he never actually constructed one before his death in 1642. Dutch scientist Christian Huygens patented the first pendulum clock in 1656, an important contribution to watchmaking, as it proved to be incredibly accurate. Before his fascination with watchmaking, Huygens helped with several advancements in science: the development of modern calculus, discovering Saturn&rsquo;s moon Titan, observing that light was composed of rays and mapping the Orion Nebula.The 18th century was rich in inventions and new developments. 1770 marked the year Abraham-Louis Perrelet invented a winding mechanism that operated in both directions via a rotor. It is considered the forerunner of the automatic, self-winding watch. Abraham-Louis Breguet, considered the father of modern watchmaking, invented the tourbillon escapement in 1795, though he didn&rsquo;t patent it until 1801 or market it until 1805. The tourbillon compensates for errors in timekeeping caused by the force of gravity when the watch is in different positions.<strong> The Smart Watch Revolution</strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-eiza-gonzalez-1024x617.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/>Image via Cute CircuitToday we are on the cusp of a smart watch revolution&hellip;.Or are we? Are we going to turn against the tide of technology and revert back to a time where watches were seen as a masterpieces and not just a practicality? Or has the moment passed? Will the simple watch be a thing of the past, a relic, an antique, a keepsake passed down from generations to keep in dusty boxes and take out and wonder in awe at whilst sporting the latest smart watch? A school of thought is that &lsquo;smart clothing&rsquo; will overtake smart watches. Not everyone wants to wear a watch. I, for one, never wear one. <a href=\"http://cutecircuit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> CuteCircuit</a> a company in the UK is developing wearable technology in a very different way..&ldquo;CuteCircuit is the fashion brand creating amazing Interactive Haute Couture and Ready to Wear that is changing the fashion landscape. CuteCircuit was founded in 2004 and will celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2014. The Ready to Wear Collection, launched in 2010 was the first ever micro-technology infused fashion collection on the market and continues to lead the way in interactive RTW. The Hug Shirt, Galaxy Dress, and Twitter Dress are some of CuteCircuit&rsquo;s pioneering fashion innovations.&rsquo;CuteCircuit come with a host of internationally fashionable and fabulous celebrity fans. Most recently, Nicole Scherzinger debuted the world&rsquo;s first haute couture dress to feature Tweets, designed and created by CuteCircuit. CuteCircuit is also the high end fashion designer of choice for Katy Perry, who has worn their creations at a number of her stage shows and red carpet appearances.&rdquo;So maybe with smart watches arguably already taking a back seat in the world of technology maybe the original watch might still have a place in our lives&hellip; Only time will tell.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Greg Matusky  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Rarely do I address local issues here on Gregarious, but what&rsquo;s happening now in Philadelphia is just too rich to ignore. </strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>  As coach Chip Kelly deconstructs our beloved Philadelphia Eagles </strong> , he is making any number of classic communications errors. Whether ridding the team of some of the NFL&rsquo;s finest talent -- LeSean McCoy, Jeremy Maclin, and, dating back to last year, DeSean Jackson -- will work or not, he has bungled the story to such a degree as to undermine his long-term relationship with many of the team's most valuable constituencies, including sponsors, advertisers, and, of critical importance, us (ME!) the fans. <br/> <br/> I believe his bungling has been so egregious that I am willing to predict that his actions of the past week and his communications failures will doom Kelly to a short tenure in the City of Brotherly Love. We are a loyal but tough sports town. We stick by our teams, even bad teams, but in return, we expect to be treated with some modicum of respect, spoken to openly and honestly, and let in on the master plan. <br/> <br/> Chip has done none of this. His missteps read like a roadmap for how any organization should never handle a reputation management issue, including: <br/> <br/> Failure to build rapport with the press corps in advance and use those relationships to effect. <br/> <br/> When Jeff Lurie bought the Eagles, Gregory FCA represented the new owner in the transaction. From the outset, both camps, buyer and seller, were extremely respectful to local reporters, building a hierarchy of influencers warranting special attention. It paid off. Lurie was received as a savior to Philadelphia, even though he had grown up in Boston as a Patriot&rsquo;s fan. Building and cultivating relationships is one way any organization can leverage the media to help extend a narrative in a time of need. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Going underground  </strong> <br/> <br/> The time to hide isn't in the heat of the battle. The head coach needs to be visible. (Editor's note: Chip Kelly must have been listening, because hours after we posted this, he held what could loosely be called a news conference, where he strutted, preened, and ranted before press corp that deserved better). He needs to be confident in, and sell, his vision to salve fan fears. For all his tough talk, I just can&rsquo;t respect someone hiding in their office, rather than addressing a fan base that has supported a team that has never won a Super Bowl. They deserve better, and so do customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders when an organization comes under heavy attack. It's ironic, despite his success on the field; Andy Reid was loathed and despised for the very same thing that Chip Kelly was supposed to change when he brought his breath of fresh air into town. No matter how much things change, they always stay the same. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Not commanding your narrative  </strong> <br/> <br/> This morning, I read Dave Spadaro&rsquo;s  <u>  commentary </u>  on the Eagle&rsquo;s own website. Spadaro walks a fine line between publicist and journalist, an Eagles&rsquo; mouthpiece, who blurs the distinction by appearing on local TV as an analyst on panels with real reporters. Today, he&rsquo;s cheerleading the trade of quarterback Nick Foles with Saint Louis for the chronically injured Sam Bradford. What&rsquo;s missing from his analysis is any degree of passion or conviction. The piece reads like season-ticket promotion, never quoting the head coach or providing a cogent articulation of what we&rsquo;re seeing. Like any organization in crisis, the Eagles need to project their narrative into the market with passion! They need to proactively explain their decision making and support it with pieces of the story we, as fans, can&rsquo;t see but need to inform and persuade others to the wisdom of the moves. Instead, crickets. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The need for discretion  </strong> <br/> <br/> Now, all of this might be predicated on a larger, master plan that can&rsquo;t be shared for fear of losing negotiating leverage in the upcoming draft. As the theory goes, the Eagles are getting their Oregon Ducks in a row to strike a bigger deal for Marcus Mariota. Well guess what? You&rsquo;re not alone Chip Kelly. Every company in the country has to manage its communications strategy against the demands for confidentiality. That&rsquo;s the great game of investor relations, informing shareholders to the point of creating a following without showing your hand to competitors, shorts and others who prey off such information. Chip, you are a big boy. Get used to it. <br/> <br/> Now in the end, you might believe all this is irrelevant. If Chip Kelly wins, then all is forgiven -- communication gaffs and all. Well, kind of. As most organizations know, arrogance and ignorance is always repaid. Perhaps not in the quarter, when a company beats expectations, but over time when things get tough. It&rsquo;s then that all is remembered. The great value of effective public relations is guarding against just that. Effective communications creates a well of goodwill to be tapped when times get tough. Chip, sometime in the future, maybe sooner than later, things may not go your way. It&rsquo;s doubtful that when that time comes you'll have a well from which Philly fans will let you drink.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If there is one thing that poor leaders share in common, it will be their unawareness that they are bad people managers. Also, many of them think they are doing pretty well as leaders. And to make things worse, when they are made aware of their ineffectiveness as managers, they are often reluctant to admit it.</p><p> It is indeed very easy to play the blame-game, because many of us are not willing to even take a look at their own actions and shortcomings. What these people don&rsquo;t realize is that knowing and admitting their mistakes is a huge step towards becoming a great leader.</p><p> If you want to be the best manager that you can be, it is important that you be a little hard on yourself. You need to do some self-evaluation, and then take the necessary action to improve on things that seem to be causing your own downfall.</p><p> <strong>  Below are some signs that you might be a bad leader: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Your Team Is Not Performing Well </strong> <br/> As a leader, your team&rsquo;s performance is what you should look at first for you to gauge your effectiveness. While there may be several other things that can affect your people&rsquo;s performance, it will all boil down to how your leadership is dealing with all those issues. Remember that poor team performance is often caused by poor management.</p><p> <strong>  2. You Don&rsquo;t Have a Good Relationship with Your People </strong> <br/> A great leader is someone who opens their door to their employees. This means that you should be willing to listen to them, and act on whatever issues they are trying to raise. If you keep ignoring their concerns, there is no reason you should expect good performance from them.</p><p> <strong>  3. You Never Ask for Feedback </strong> <br/> Lousy leaders are likely to blame others when things are doing well. Such leaders don&rsquo;t have the guts to ask for feedback, and they never want to be held accountable for anything. To become a good leader, you have to give value to what your workers think about you and your leadership. By doing this, you&rsquo;re giving yourself a chance to know how else you can improve to become a better manager.</p><p> <strong>  4. Your Team Is Not Inspired and Motivated </strong> <br/> Believe it or not, how you interact with your staff has a huge effect on how they feel about their individual work. If you don&rsquo;t communicate with them as often as you should, they will be unmotivated to work. And when there is no motivation, there is no employee engagement, which then results in poor employee performance.</p><p> <strong>  Being a manager or a leader is no joke. </strong> This position gives you so much power, but it also comes with so many responsibilities. That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t just sit there, give orders and wait for results. Keep in mind that the only way your effectiveness could be measured is through the performance of your team. If you need help in becoming a good manager, an <u>  executive coaching program </u> could definitely be what you need to develop the skills of a great leader.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  As a female FBI agent, there were very few other women in my office&mdash;or in the building, for that matter. The closest thing to a mentor I had was my male training agent, who viewed me as more of a burden than an opportunity. </strong></p><p> But it had been to my advantage to be raised on a cattle ranch in the middle of Wyoming. It was a tough environment&mdash;fast food was hitting a deer at 60 miles an hour. My grandmother had ammo on her Christmas list. And there is one thing you never say to a grandmother who is a crack shot with a rifle&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault.&rdquo;</p><p> This was exactly the type of mental toughness I needed when I found myself as a new agent in an FBI squad with few allies and no obvious mentors waiting to take me under their wing. Instead of blaming others, I knew that I would need to find my own way to move forward if I wanted to be successful.</p><p> On my first squad, my desk was next to a hardened older agent named Leo who looked at me with suspicion&mdash;could a woman be relied upon to have his back if we found ourselves in a shootout? He thought not, or at least had his doubts. I could tell by the way he treated me&mdash;with quiet disdain.</p><p> Not all mentoring relationships need to be formalized. Leo was an unwitting mentor who would be horrified to think that I considered him as one! But I watched how he worked his cases. He was a thorough investigator who pursued any and all leads. And when he didn&rsquo;t have any, he still kept at it.</p><p> Mentors teach, coach, guide, and motivate. Leo did all of these things for me, without knowing it. I used the information I learned from him, about reading body language and listening for verbal cues, during the rest of my career. I never liked Leo, and we never so much as had a cup of coffee together, but he was one of the best mentors I ever had.</p><p> Why is it important for you to have a mentor to guide you toward success? Even more importantly, what characteristics make a good mentor for you?</p><p> The term mentor has become watered-down in the last few years. It can encompass anything from self-help books, to touchy-feely therapy sessions when times get tough, to a wise and trusted guide through business and life.</p><p> March is Women&rsquo;s History Month, and as I reflect on #IWD2015 (International Women&rsquo;s Day on March 8, 2015) I want to share with you some of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned about how women can find the perfect mentor to guide them toward success:</p><p> <strong>  1.

My teacher, Mrs. Archie, was very stingy with praise, so you can imagine how much I disliked her. She let me know right away that I was not the smartest person in the room, so when I did get an A she responded with, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve worked very hard to get this grade.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, but she was creating a growth mindset in the way that I looked at my obstacles. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck\" target=\"_blank\">   Researcher Carol Dweck  </a> </u>  discovered that our mindset affects our ability to fulfill our potential&mdash;to grow and learn, take risks, bounce back from adversity, and to build healthy relationships.   </p><p> If we have a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; we believe our qualities, including our intelligence, are something we were born with and cannot be changed.  If we have a &ldquo;growth mindset,&rdquo; we believe that we can cultivate and grow our basic qualities, including our intelligence.</p><p> Some of the brightest people avoid challenges, dislike working hard, and wilt in the face of difficulty. In other words, it&rsquo;s not always the people who start out the smartest in the room who end up being the smartest.</p><p> A perfect mentor will challenge you to create a growth mindset.</p><p> <strong>  2. Create A Strong Mind </strong></p><p> My grandmother was a larger-than-life force in my life. When things didn&rsquo;t work out the way I expected, she taught me how to be mentally tough. She had no time for people who would not take responsibility for their situation.</p><p> I didn&rsquo;t sweat it when I found no females to mentor me as an FBI agent. I knew that if I wanted to be treated as an equal, I needed to act as an equal. Whining, complaining, blaming others, and making excuses wouldn&rsquo;t get me anywhere. </p><p> If women are going to use the excuse that they can&rsquo;t make their way up the corporate ladder because they can&rsquo;t find other women to mentor them, then they probably aren&rsquo;t taking their careers very seriously. Take responsibility and find the best person to inspire you to be the best you can be.</p><p> Here are the questions I ask myself when looking for a mentor from among the people around me:</p><li> How can they help me be better at my job?</li><li> Are they respected by subordinates, peers, and superiors?</li><li> What skills do they have that I need to develop?</li><li> How much more do they know more about (this project) than I do?</li><li> In what ways are they willing to share that knowledge?</li><li> Will they give me the honest feedback I need?</li><li> Why do I admire them?</li><li> How will working with them make me a better person? <br/>  </li><p> A perfect mentor will show you how to develop the mental toughness needed to get you through the roadblocks that are in the way of your success. </p><p> <strong>  3. Play Big </strong></p><p> In the FBI, power meetings among male leaders were held during happy hour&mdash;the ones I was never invited to attend. In many larger corporations, power meetings are held in the men&rsquo;s bathroom during bio-breaks. Either way, the opportunity for women to participate is limited.</p><p> When I was tempted to play the victim, I was thought about Leo. He was awkward, ugly and had a quirky personality. He wasn&rsquo;t invited to happy hour, either. And yet, the truth is this: Leo was a big player in the world of FBI counterintelligence investigations. As my unofficial mentor, he reminded me that people will do things to let you down, and even screw you over&mdash;that is life!</p><p> <strong>  So get over it. </strong></p><p> Leo refused to think small. He&rsquo;d never start a sentence with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert but&hellip;&ldquo; and then apologize. He taught me that leaders, both men and women, need to play big by taking control of how they react to a situation, and when the going gets tough, to roll up their sleeves and get even tougher. </p><p> He taught me how to recognize self-doubt and not let it dictate my actions.</p><p> <strong>  A perfect mentor will help you to develop confidence in yourself and your abilities. </strong></p><p> As women celebrate #IWD2015, find a mentor who can guide you toward success in both business and life.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://streamnowtv.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ron Valderrama  </u> </a></p><p> For many entrepreneurs it starts off with that &ldquo;shower moment&rdquo;. You know you&rsquo;re in the shower and that light bulb goes off for a great idea. We&rsquo;ve all had that right? But are you willing to do anything about it? The funny thing about most of those ideas, is you probably don&rsquo;t work in the industry that you are proposing to disrupt. That leads to the struggle we have all had in our own minds&mdash;a blend of logic, fear and lack of resources. I would submit however that the very things we do to talk ourselves out of something will potentially be our greatest asset. The power of not knowing any better, so let&rsquo;s dive into all three of these factors.</p><p> <strong>  LOGIC: </strong></p><p> Logic can be our worst enemy in terms of convincing ourselves that we should not take on an endeavor. That is actually a good thing given most startups fail and you want to make sure you think it through. The problem with logic is when it bleeds into peripheral aspects of the actual idea. What I mean here is when you determine that the idea is solid and potentially executable but you start thinking about your actual life and surroundings. How can I do this when I have a family to support? I have worked too hard to get the position I am in with my current company. How can I fund this when I barely have enough to put in savings each month? I have never worked in technology before and would never be able to pull this off. All these things lead to fear.</p><p> <strong>  FEAR: </strong></p><p> I always say that if you don&rsquo;t have some element of fear, your idea is not big enough. Fear is simply the residue of courage. If you are passionate about the idea and there is a market for it, PLEASE don&rsquo;t let fear stop you from taking the first step. It will be scary. It will be hard. It will be lonely. It will be exhausting. It will also be the absolute ride of your life. To pull it off in the beginning will mean saying goodbye to sleep and social life but you don&rsquo;t have to quit your job to start, so that fear factor can be eliminated. Because entry into starting a business is getting easier and less expensive, you don&rsquo;t need to deplete your 401 (k) right off the bat to start building a minimal viable product. There has never been more information and do it yourself services available to entrepreneurs. That leads us to lack of resources.</p><p> <strong>  LACK OF RESOURCES: </strong></p><p> I think it started with Y Combinator but it is much more wide spread than that now. Entrepreneurs started talking and more importantly sharing information. Go back 10-15 years and most first time entrepreneurs probably never knew what a term sheet looked like or what it meant. Now you can do the research to have a very good idea of what to look for when you get that first term sheet. When I first started out I had no idea how angel investing and venture capital worked or even what the difference was between the two. A couple of YouTube searches later I had a fairly firm grasp. Additionally, there is information about how to structure a company as well as do it yourself services like eMinutes and LegalZoom. You can research what entity type is best for your situation and execute on it at a greatly reduced cost. Companies like WordPress and Square Space have made it easy and cheap to get a website off the ground.</p><p> OK, so let&rsquo;s assume that you made it past these factors and have decided to press through. This is where it gets interesting. You can actually take these same potential roadblocks and use them to your advantage. Logic will tell you that you don&rsquo;t know anything about the industry that you are trying to disrupt but the reason your company would be able to disrupt anything is because the incumbent companies you will be taking on are stuck in the status quo and move incredibly slow. You can move very fast and test quickly. The legacy companies have proven processes for everything, but remember you don&rsquo;t know any better so you just do what you think might work. I am telling you this is amazing. A lot of the things you try won&rsquo;t work but it is incredibly powerful when you find that thing that does work. What is even more interesting is when you try to start a company by doing things the way the industry is already doing it in terms of biz dev, distribution and development, you will probably not succeed. It is truly the fact that you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing that makes the difference and that is powerful indeed.</p><p> Ron Valderrama is the Founder of <a href=\"http://streamnowtv.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Stream Now TV  </u> </a> , Inc. and <a href=\"http://singlewize.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SingleWize  </u> </a></p>",

    "link": "technology-and-regulation-a-modern-day-tortoise-and-hare-talewith-a-twist",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Raise your hand if you have a mobile device. </strong></p><p> Ok, good; you&rsquo;re in the majority of business professionals today who are putting technology to good use.  [It&rsquo;s very easy to figure out who the hare is in this tale is going to be; think of the &ldquo;Energizer Bunny&rdquo;.]</p><p> Now, raise your hand if you think compliance and regulation are able to keep up with technology today.</p><p> <strong>  What?  I don&rsquo;t see one hand raised out there in social media land.  What&rsquo;s up with that? </strong></p><p> What you&rsquo;re experiencing is the modern-day story of the tortoise and the hare race, except the difference in today&rsquo;s story is that the hare is winning&hellip;by a lot!</p><p> I&rsquo;m not a compliance poo-pooer, not at all.  I believe in keeping consumers and advisors both safe.  Compliance has a definite place.  What I am is intolerant of is embracing practices that purposely hold an entire legion of financial services professionals back who are working to improve the financial landscape of those they serve.  It&rsquo;s like the tortoise became cavalier with his win and when the hare actually dug into the race and sped out ahead, the tortoise had to pull out all the stops to &ldquo;win&rdquo; the race back.  Not entirely fair.</p><p> And this problem is not only specific to financial services though.  I recently watched an episode of  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23JayToday&amp;src=typd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #JayToday  </a> </u>  with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jaybaer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jay Baer  </a> </u>  of Convince &amp; Convert.  [He&rsquo;s one of my favorite social media strategist.]  In this YouTube, he talks about being on a flight and using software that allows you to text via WiFi and then being called out by a flight attendant. The flight attendant was so fixated on the regulation, she then become short-sighted and didn&rsquo;t know the appropriate work around on this.   It makes those spewing regulation look old and crotchety.  You should watch the episode above.</p><p> After a recent SIFMA conference,  <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/02/26/financial-industry-not-doing-great-job-on-social-m?ref=rss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ThinkAdvisor.com published an article </a>  telling the financial services community they were behind in social media use (duh, right?) and later  <u>  <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/pplx-marketing/website/pdf/The_State_of_Social_Selling_Survey_2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   confirmed by a PeopleLinx report discussing social selling trends  </a> </u>  that 73% of respondents saw value in social selling, yet only 26% overall felt they knew how to use social for selling.   <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/pplx-marketing/website/pdf/The_State_of_Social_Selling_Survey_2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   When PeopleLinx dug into the report findings more, they uncovered when encouragement, training and measurement were provided, social increased dramatically  </u>  .   </a></p><p> So why does regulation continue to be so far behind technology? It&rsquo;s a loaded question and not one we are going to answer in this blog, but one we need to continue to question every time an advisor is told &ldquo;No&rdquo; by someone in an officer role.  It&rsquo;s ok to ask, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and really dig into the reason behind it.  It&rsquo;s the only way we are going to push compliance to acknowledge the slow response to change and adjust accordingly.  Our ability to be nimble is imperative if we are to keep up with other industries of professionals who are gaining face time with our clients.</p><p> <strong>  I really want the underdog to win, but not by undermining the race.  Play hard, yet play fair. </strong></p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p> <p>  </p>",

    "link": "the-dress-phenomenon-and-the-color-of-sales-perception",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> You've likely heard the recent story or have seen the pictures of the now infamous  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dress-a-black-and-blue-debate-over-the-color-of-a-dress-stirs-social-media-1425063162\" target=\"_blank\">   dress  </a> </u> . One snapshot and the debate began, is it white and gold or blue and black?  <u>  Science chimed in </u>  and explained that we potentially see things differently based on the way that our minds filter images and light.</p><p> But what does this have to do with sales and perception? Quite a bit, actually. The challenge for consultative sales professionals is twofold. The first challenge is seeing the perceived situation through the customer&rsquo;s lens. The second is framing a solution that is perceived to align with that individual&rsquo;s picture of their present state of affairs versus desired state. The risk of misalignment is significant throughout the sales process, especially if the client themselves are looking through a distorted or cloudy lens which is often the case when clients don&rsquo;t fully recognize the potential need.</p><p> Why is it that regarding their product knowledge, some of the brightest and most technically astute people cannot sell? We know that if sales professionals concentrate strictly on product knowledge and the technical factors regarding their solutions, they risk missing the filters each client applies &ndash; or the &ldquo;color&rdquo; in which the customer perceives the solution. Just as individuals may see colors differently based on the way the mind filters light, individuals also use filters when making business decisions. If you ignore or fail to recognize these filters, your chance of connecting with the client plummets. Luckily, we can identify the most significant filters that clients use when making decisions, and, if applied correctly, the chances of &ldquo;firing on all cylinders&rdquo; with the client increases substantially.</p><p> <strong>  The Sales Equation </strong>  &ndash; Consider this example, which displays some of the most common filters used in making sales and business decisions. In this example, if the salesperson relies solely on the &ldquo;story&rdquo;, which includes their product knowledge and expertise, they have a 1 in 64 chance of completely connecting with the customer. (4 behavioral styles x 4 communication styles x 4 convincer strategies). If they correctly identify and appeal to each filter, then they totally connect both in terms of understanding the customer&rsquo;s picture and providing a solution that matches. If you miss just one filter, at best the message is mixed and at worst it is completely wrong. <br/>  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sales-equation.png\" width=\"641\"/></p><p> <strong>  You Can&rsquo;t Force Another Person to Filter Messages the Way that You Do! </strong></p><p> This explains why salespeople lose opportunities even when the client situation and your solution looks identical to another that a different client may have fully embraced. To top it off, without the knowledge and experience to recognize these filters, salespeople default to their own filters when presenting their solutions to customers, which is taking a gamble that each customer will use the same filters as they do when making decisions.</p><p> In the example of the &ldquo;dress&rdquo;, you can&rsquo;t control how your brain sees it and that is why some people cannot see the dress in blue/black and others cannot see the dress in white and gold. Hence the debate. If Joe sees it as &ldquo;A&rdquo; and Mary sees it as &ldquo;B&rdquo;, Joe and Mary may NEVER agree on the color of the dress because their perception is polar opposite.</p><p> The same is true with sales filters. You can&rsquo;t force someone to see through your filters or the same set of filters that you are using. You can, however, recognize the filters and adjust your approach to the customer&rsquo;s lens.</p><p> <strong>  The Filters </strong></p><p> The filters presented in this example are absolutely key and foundational to implementing a consultative sales strategy and interaction that is impactful for each client and situation. There even more filters that you could consider, accelerating the risk of not connecting. To apply specific filters for your customer base, we could apply additional psychological factors to the mix such as behavioral economics, generational considerations, financial aspects and other key indicators that you would glean from accurate market research data regarding how your clients buy from you. This example also assumes that the salesperson knows their product information, industry knowledge and can navigate their internal customers, or you could also consider that another variable in the equation, again adding risk.</p><p> To do justice to each of the filters represented in this example, it will require separate blog articles. Here is an overview for your consideration:</p><p> <strong>  Behavioral Styles </strong>  &ndash; Refers to the logic that people use when making decisions. There are four core behavioral styles. In our Consultative Sales Certification program we refer to these as Director, Expressive, Steady and Analytical. While we are a mix of all four styles, we have a tendency to be dominant in one or two. That dominance significantly impacts the way that we make decisions and are influenced. Sales people need to first recognize the dominant style in their customers and adjust the approach that they use to influence them accordingly. For instance some of the factors that Directors are influenced by include accomplishments, results and getting things done. Some of the ways that Expressive people are influenced are by emotion, visibility, color and trends. Steady people tend to be influenced by the opinions of others that they respect, team members, reliability and performance. And, Analytical people tend to think systematically and are influenced through process, proven quality, research and making what are good decisions in their mind.</p><p> <strong>  Communication Styles </strong>  &ndash; This is the vehicle that we use to send and receive information. We process information using our senses, specifically sight, sound and touch. (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic and Cerebral.) While we all use each of these senses, we have a preference as it pertains to communication. Without previous training, most people aren&rsquo;t even aware of their preferences. Once you recognize the communication style preference that the customer uses, you can, and should, adjust how you communicate with them. If salespeople do not adjust to communication preferences, you are at significant risk of the intended message being garbled.</p><p> <strong>  Convincer Strategies  </strong> &ndash; These are the specific triggers or sorting patterns that tend to influence each individual. This explains why some people are more loyal, why some customers need constant change and some customers are in the middle. We refer to core convincer strategies as matcher and mismatchers with exceptions being the largest population. Knowing this information tells you who you need to present changes to or be at risk of losing them, who will be first adopters to new ideas and which customers you need to present similarities to in terms of solutions they may be considering. Convincer strategies also deals with the order in which you need to present solutions to be effective in influencing a decision.</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "knowing-me-knowing-you-relationship-marketing-and-private-clients",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The common mantra in private client firms when the subject of client research comes up is usually &ldquo;ah but we know what our clients want&rdquo;. After all the reasoning goes, advisers are talking to them day in day out why would they not know what they want?</p><p> Well firstly most client conversations are quite focused on an immediate instruction, query or problem. Most advisers don&rsquo;t have time to chew the fat with all their clients regularly unless they really do have a handful of very ultra high net worth clients.</p><p> Secondly it&rsquo;s quite difficult to get a clear picture of your overall client base by aggregating the feedback of your front office.</p><p> This is crucial for two reasons &ndash; targeting your services and encouraging referrals.</p><p> <strong>  TARGETING YOUR SERVICES </strong></p><p> Financial advisers have had it drummed into them for the last few years that they need to segment their client bases and with the sun already beginning to set on trail commission, identifying a clear picture of which clients advisers should continue to serve and how, and those who need perhaps to be encouraged to seek guidance and more self-serve routes is becoming an urgent issue.</p><p> Some firms have found this easier than others but the clock ticking is almost audible. Other sorts of private client firms may be able to ignore that sound for the moment but all firms need a clear, costed picture of what they can offer, profitably, to whom and how in an increasingly competitive landscape with lower cost, digitally-enabled business models popping up every week, if they want to ensure their ongoing survival.</p><p> <strong>  ENCOURAGING REFERRALS </strong></p><p> For most private client firms new clients primarily come through the clients you already have and the professional connections you have built and nurtured over the years. Encouraging referrals from private clients and professional connections requires a very different approach than merely shouting one's message as hard as possible at as many people as possible.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t to say that share of voice and consistent message delivery doesn&rsquo;t have a part to play but current contacts and clients and introducers need clarity first &ndash; clarity on what you stand for as a firm, the sorts of clients you are looking for and the sorts of solutions you can help them with. Long lists of broad client categories and service lists that focus on service features not client benefits is not going to help.</p><p> The most common comment I hear when speaking to private clients about barriers to referring business is are that they are not sure what sort of client their banker/adviser wants, they worry that their peer group may be of insufficient interest to their current adviser, and, where they are vague about their adviser&rsquo;s wider range of services, they are less confident in referring both their contacts and themselves for their own wider needs.</p><p> Firms that address these barriers will find their message more easily digested by their target audiences and more easily repeated on to others. Those who hide behind a generic target audience description of &ldquo;private clients&rdquo; and a list of services that is meaningful to them but jargon to their clients, cannot be surprised if their clients struggle to advocate on their behalf.</p><p> <strong>  TALK TO YOUR CLIENTS AND CONNECTIONS </strong></p><p> Try talking directly to key clients and introducers. Ask their opinion about your business. Get them round the table and talk to them about their needs and their insights. Learn what language they use when talking about you and what you do for them. Lay out case study examples for them and get their feedback on what resonates and what doesn&rsquo;t. Talk about what sort of clients you think would benefit from what you do and what sort of service areas you are seeking to grow. Talk to them about what trigger moments might prompt a need of your services.</p><p> Introducing the tricky topic of broadening what you do for your clients and how clients and introducers can support referrals is easier and more natural for both sides as part of a wider conversation. This sort of relationship marketing requires a detailed understanding internally within your firm about what you stand for, precisely who it is that you want to work with and what it is you can do for them. But it will help generate more subtle and effective ideas than the blunt instruments of promotional marketing can.</p>",

    "link": "strengthening-your-financial-plan-with-retirement-account-contributions",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bellinvest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   James Bell  </a> </u></p><p> As we get closer to April 15, tax day in the United States, this may be a helpful reminder: you are still eligible to make certain retirement account contributions for last year (2014) even if you missed the December 31, 2014 date. Making contributions to your retirement accounts is a good way to strengthen your financial and retirement plan. Follow these tips to keep your retirement on track.</p><p> 1. Did you max out contributions to your employer-sponsored retirement account in 2014? Will you do so again in 2015? If so, think IRA contribution!</p><p> If you have maxed out your employer-sponsored retirement account salary deferral last year and are likely to do so in 2015 (2015 max: $24,000 with catch-up), pat yourself on the back: Good job! Then consider making a contribution to an IRA (Individual Retirement Account) or Roth IRA for tax year 2014. There is still time to make this contribution for last year right up until the tax filing deadline date of April 15. If eligible, you are allowed to contribute up to $5,500 to either an IRA or Roth IRA (but not both) plus $1,000 catch-up for those 50 or older.</p><p> ❯ Note: Eligibility to contribute to any type of IRA is dependent on having earned income in the contribution year, and you may be subject to income phase out rules, so please check with your tax advisor regarding eligibility rules, income limits, and deductibility rules.</p><p> 2. If age 50 or older, take advantage of catch-up contributions.</p><p> If you are age 50 or older, you are allowed to make additional (known as &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo;) contributions to your employer-sponsored retirement plan [401(k), 403(b), 457, or TSP] and/or to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.</p><p> For employer-sponsored retirement accounts:</p><li> For 2014, you are able to defer the catch-up amount of $5,500 in addition to $17,500 for a total maximum deferral amount of $23,000.</li><li> In 2015, the catch-up increases to $6,000 in addition to the increased amount of $18,000, for a total maximum deferral amount of $24,000.</li><p> For IRA or Roth IRA, for both 2014 and 2015, you can contribute a catch-up amount of $1,000 for a maximum contribution of $6,500 annually.</p><p> 3. Are you self-employed and have a retirement plan already established for your small business?</p><p> If you are self-employed, you have the right to contribute part of your income to a self-employed retirement savings plan like a SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension); a solo 401(k), i.e. a (i401k); or SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees). Setting one up, or maxing out your contribution for the current year if you have one, is an excellent way for those self-employed to shelter income.</p><p> You still have time as the employer to make your 2014 employer contribution to the plan. Be sure to check with your tax advisor for the exact amount you are able to contribute, but remember: sheltering taxable income decreases your taxable income for the year, which in turn builds up the strength of your retirement plan.</p><p> ❯ Note: Check out the IRS website for IRA Contribution Limits. <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics-IRA-Contribution-Limits\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics-IRA-Contribution-Limits  </a> </u></p><p> In summary, if you are wondering how to prioritize your retirement savings, we generally recommend maxing out your employer-sponsored retirement account first before funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Focusing on your employer-sponsored retirement account is especially important if your employer matches a percentage of your contributions&mdash;so you do not miss out on that free money. If your employer does not offer a plan and you are not self-employed, then an IRA (traditional or Roth) can be a great place for retirement contributions. Please remember, you should discuss your own situation with your financial advisor or tax expert before making any major financial decisions.</p><p> Be kind to yourself, and help your retirement plan by making retirement account contributions for 2014 before it&rsquo;s too late!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Have you ever watched a movie being filmed?  Right as the director hits the record button he takes a deep breath, centers in, and says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re rolling.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a signal to everyone in the studio to be ready for action.  The crew gets quiet; actors take their places and get in character.  The entire studio is on cue and knows exactly what to do, because this is what everyone has been waiting for.</p><p> <strong>  A star is born </strong></p><p> Now think about your brand&rsquo;s spotlight moment.  When you put the launch info up and out to the world, you cement the final company logo, or your website goes live, it means it&rsquo;s time to let everyone know what you are about.  This is why you went into  <u>  business </u>  in the first place to tell your brand story and to help others feel uniquely empowered in ways that only your company can offer them.</p><p> We share your excitement because you and brands like you, are the very reason Entwine was born.  We help you take the action-packed thriller of your business brand story to the next level.</p><p> We put all the tools in place to help you make an award-winning product launch, successful brand reboot, or even just a bettercontent or design strategy. But enough about us, let&rsquo;s focus on you and how to let the outside world know that your business is &ldquo;rolling.&rdquo;  And soon to be &ldquo;rolling in the dough.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  So how do you make your brand story &ldquo;roll?&rdquo;  </strong></p><p> First, let&rsquo;s get the terminology down.  In this sense &ldquo;roll&rdquo; means flow.  There are no interruptions and no hiccups&mdash;everything is going smoothly.  This is important for your brand story, the mentality and your customer&rsquo;s purchasing psychology.  The customer wants to see congruency, and you want to see fluency on the backend.</p><p> <strong>  Discovering your special character </strong></p><p> As you start to gain some momentum you are going to find that certain things come up, professionals&mdash;just like professional actors&mdash;need to be coached and directed from time to time, equipment and software needs to be tweaked and your business may feel anything but &lsquo;automated.&rsquo;  On the upside this is where you can take a competitive edge.When you realize where the loopholes are you know exactly what you need to do to improve your behind-the-scenes strategy.</p><p> Look at Apple for instance.  They are notorious for launching successful product after product and all of their launches equal Hollywood red carpet sized fan appeal.  Your launch, to your list, can be just as enormous.  It doesn&rsquo;t have to send title waves around the Atlantic Ocean, but it should capture the attention of your audience and convince them that something is going on over at your company.  Do this by being cognizant of your companies pre-selling and pre-positioning tactics before your big launch.</p><p> <strong>  Roll out the red carpet </strong></p><p> Whatever you can do to promote and position your brand story is going to help generate buzz around your company.  The more buzz, the more conversations are going to be sparked about what your up to.  Add fuel to your fire by keeping hot on social media, hitting your list, and working key strategic partnerships.  All of these minor details play a major role in getting your company noticed but you have to do some hustle to the get big results.</p><p> <strong>  Get your brand advocates aligned </strong></p><p> A good director is able to get everyone in place and ready moments before the red button gets pushed.  Good management is no different.  Make sure your entire team and your raving fans are on board before you roll out something new.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s your next big brand moment and do you have any pre-promoting plans before the big day?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  General Norman Schwarzkopf once famously described leadership as a &ldquo;potent combination of strategy and character. </strong> But if you must be without one, be without the strategy.&rdquo;</p><p> Strategy is often clear-cut: you inspire a vision, create goals, and execute the necessary tasks. You have a clear measuring stick and, while life and leadership are rarely black-and-white, you have a map with guideposts along the way.</p><p> Character, however, isn&rsquo;t always so well-defined. Our values play a huge role and, if unidentified, you may often find yourself waffling, spinning your wheels, and making inconsistent decisions. On the flip side, clear values lead to clear actions &ndash; and powerful leadership.</p><p> <strong>  Zhena Muzyka, founder of Zhena&rsquo;s Gypsy Tea </strong> , seemed to know this early. As she vividly shares in her 2014 book  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-Cup-Ingredients-Purpose-Filled-Bottomless/dp/147675960X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426194877&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Life+By+The+Cup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Life By The Cup  </u> </a> , she began her business out of necessity: a single mother to an infant son with medical issues, she needed a way to pay for his healthcare. She blended her passion for tea, her desire to care for her family, and her core values to form an enterprise.</p><p> Zhena experienced lean days familiar to many entrepreneurs. During those times, opportunities arose that perhaps would have significantly increased her revenue and business stature, but would also prove a slippery slope with regard to her values. Time and time again Zhena chose in favor of her values, and now her business &ndash; as well as her integrity &ndash; thrive.</p><p> <strong>  This book holds many insightful tips for the purposeful professional, including: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Reach out. </strong> So many of us &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo; or feel that as smart, capable people we should be able to figure everything out. I love that Zhena never pretended to have all the answers, or even most of the answers, but she held her vision high and reached out to others who did. &ldquo;When we learn to ask for help,&rdquo; she reminds us, &ldquo;we allow others to participate in our life and invest in the relationship.&rdquo; Rather than thinking of asking for help as a burden, we can actually view it as a gift.</p><p> <strong>  Work with purpose. </strong> Zhena&rsquo;s work is an obvious extension of her values and an expression of her purpose. She never waffled on those values, even when it would have been lucrative to do so. She also didn&rsquo;t get &ldquo;lost in the weeds&rdquo; of the day-to-day tasks: &ldquo;There is no higher purpose or honor in anyone&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; Muzyka writes, &ldquo;than to serve and nourish others. May your days be filled with this knowing.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Show up. </strong> As somewhat of an accidental entrepreneur myself, I can second Zhena&rsquo;s suggestion that a big percentage of success is just showing up. Planning plays an important role, but at some point we need to dive in. Attend the meeting. Write the draft. Do the work rather than ruminate and overthink. One of my favorite lines in the entire book: &ldquo;I was moving so fast that fear couldn&rsquo;t catch me.&rdquo;</p><p> This book unexpectedly snuck into my pile late last year and turned out to be one of my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iowabiz.com/2014/12/top-5-leadership-books-of-the-year.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   favorites of 2014  </a> </u> . I am a full-fledged coffee lover but was even inspired in the beverage arena: I consumed more tea while reading Life By The Cup than the entire year prior! For a heartfelt glimpse into purposeful entrepreneurship, values-based leadership, and succeeding in meaningful work, grab a cup of tea and this book. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p><p> <strong>  COACH'S CHALLENGE: </strong></p><p> <strong>  What are your 3 core values? </strong> If you cannot easily answer this question, conduct a values clarification. One route: Review a large list of values, highlighting those that matter most to you. Continue paring down until you&rsquo;ve identified the three that resonate deeply with your core and that imbue your decisions, actions, and choices. Values clarification isn&rsquo;t necessarily easy, but knowing those values makes decision-making (and nearly everything else) much easier.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  There seems to be some confusion on when its appropriate to wear a bowtie &ndash; the short answer, anytime you want.  </strong> Throw one on with a button down, blazer and jeans, or give a life to an old suit when paired together.   Bowties are an admirable accessory! Once tied around your neck, you go from blending into the crowd to standing out as an individual.</p><p> When wearing this little but significant piece, make sure your choice in pattern and size are foolproof.  Since you and your bowtie will already be the center of attention, you don&rsquo;t need to make a bigger statement by rocking a loud eccentric print. Keep your patterns neutral or stick with the classics: plaids, checks or stripes.  Next, pay attention to your proportions &ndash; when it comes to bow ties, size does matter.  The last thing you want is that &lsquo;big guy in a little bowtie&rsquo; look.  You can avoid this by selecting the right bow width for your size.  If you&rsquo;re an average built man, a standard bow (about 2 &frac12; inches) will fit you perfectly.  For those of you who are large and in charge with neck sizes greater than 17 &frac12; inches, I recommend a 3 &frac12; inch bow.</p><p> Now if wish to be like the cool kids and venture into the world of bowties, there is one oath required: Forego pre-tied and clip-on bowties.  Stop being lazy and manually tie your bow.  A self-tied bow has a handsome naturalness.  By taking thirty seconds to tie it yourself, you will look polished and well accomplished, like you&rsquo;re somebody who just has life figured out.  </p><p> Still unsure? Just follow the numbers.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-12-at-7.09.37-PM_0.png\" width=\"647\"/></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Welcome to the first in our series that features Advisorpedia contributors on their business, views on the industry and more. Enjoy! </strong></p><p> <strong>  How did your career start? </strong> <br/> As a broker for a boutique investment bank.  It was like a scene out of the movie &ldquo;Boiler Room.&rdquo;  My worst job; my greatest experience.</p><p> <strong>  Tell us about how it&rsquo;s evolved. </strong> <br/> That role reshaped my professional goals.  Originally, I wanted to be a stockbroker so I could make money for people.  Ultimately, I realized that my passion and values were better aligned in helping investors reach their financial goals.  The difference sounds subtle but the impact was transformational.  In search of a firm that served client needs in a comprehensive, transparent and objective fashion, I discovered the world of independent Registered Investment Advisors.  I&rsquo;ve never looked back.</p><p> <strong>  What brought you to become an entrepreneur and start your own business? </strong> <br/> Partnering with smart, determined and purpose-driven advisors to launch their own RIA firm or enhance their existing firm is SO contagious to me.  I admire their passion, their courage and their vision.  I reached the point in my career where I wanted to be more entrepreneurial and spend my time working with that type of advisor and business owner, as well as the ecosystem that supports them.  So in 2013 I set out on my own.</p><p> <strong>  What were some of the challenges? </strong> <br/> You wear every hat.  Figuring out the best and highest use of your time is critical. Resource allocation.  Where are the greatest benefits for my spend? Tunnel vision.  Stay connected and get out of the office &ndash; consistently glean feedback and perspective from prospects, clients and industry contacts.  </p><p> <strong>  Now that you&rsquo;re outside the corporate world, do you have a different view of it? </strong> <br/> I underutilized the vast resources I had at my disposal. I have a greater appreciation for culture. The power of &ldquo;team&rdquo; is undeniable.</p><p> <strong>  Could you go back? </strong> <br/> It depends how you define &ldquo;corporate.&rdquo;  If it was an incredibly entrepreneurial culture with a unique vision, keen understanding of the marketplace and an opportunity to have a profound impact on the RIA space, than I could possibly consider it.  The value I create, how I do it, with whom and for whom is far more important than the number of employees or company status.  </p><p> <strong>  How did you come to specialize in advisors in transition? </strong> <br/> As I evolved in my role as advice provider, my focus shifted from investors to advisors that were serving clients. Helping to create, or enhance, businesses that would better serve the needs of investors became my niche.  In so doing, I became an advocate for the RIA as much as the investor. Professionally, there is no greater satisfaction than partnering with an advisor and helping him or her launch their own RIA.  Assisting them in accomplishing this monumental milestone is the most gratifying and fun work I can do.</p><p> <strong>  Talk about your category. What is an advisor in transition? </strong> <br/> It describes a financial advisor or team that is contemplating the RIA model as an alternative to their current situation.  Typically, they are successful in their own right and are either unable to do/provide something or, they are looking to assert greater control over some or perhaps many aspects of their business.  Advisors in this state often express it as &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve outgrown my firm.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  If someone sees your category, what can they expect to read about? What do you hope they will learn? </strong> <br/> I strive to provide a personal perspective on many aspects associated with the RIA.  My hope is that the reader gains an appreciation for the RIA opportunity, can identify his or her own feelings and goals with the broader topic, and glean practical advice as to how to approach any of the items we discuss.</p><p> <strong>  What are the kinds of things that you assist advisors in doing? </strong> <br/> If an advisor wants to launch or join and RIA, we educate them about the opportunities, define their &ldquo;ideal business vision, help navigate the process and connect them to the resources and partners they need to see their goal become a reality. We also work with select RIAs that are looking to enhance business outcomes via transition, sale, merger, acquisition and recruiting.</p><p> <strong>  Have you noticed any trends recently when it comes to advisors in transition? </strong> <br/> Advisors and Teams that are seriously considering moving to the RIA space tend to be larger in size and success than in past years. Size and success doesn&rsquo;t necessarily predict the launching of one&rsquo;s own RIA verus joining another entity.  The ecosystem has evolved to offer some very differentiated and robust solutions that can be equally compelling to larger advisors. The &ldquo;surge&rdquo; remains a steady drip.  (Although this year and next should be interesting as many retention deals expire.)</p><p> <strong>  Who&rsquo;s winning? </strong> <br/> The Investor.  Cerulli estimates that approximately 25% of all investors assets are currently managed by an independent RIA.  As more RIAs are minted, and existing RIAs continue having success in conveying their value proposition, that number should only increase.  Aspiring Fiduciaries.  Your skill set, passion and creativity are highly sought in wealth management firms around the country.</p><p> <strong>  Are hybrids gaining ground? </strong> <br/> Yes.  Research shows this is the fastest growing segment within the RIA space.  What I&rsquo;d like to see is how many hybrids still maintain their commission-based business say 3+ years after launching their RIA.  No doubt, the commission-based solution is essential for many in porting an entire book of business at the point of transition.  Interestingly though, there&rsquo;s an increasing ability to convert many commission-based products to fee-based alternatives.  Thus, for many RIAs, the need for a broker-dealer affiliation wanes as they and their clients become more knowledgeable about such substitutes.  I&rsquo;ll do some digging.</p><p> <strong>  Are the wire houses staying pat? </strong> <br/> No.  Do they ever?  But the statistics show they are losing share.  Cerulli&rsquo;s data shows that by 2017 RIA-managed assets stand to best that the wire houses.  To address this trend, we have seen certain IBD&rsquo;s launch RIA-platforms.  And just recently the rumor surfaced that Wells Fargo Advisors may be contemplating something similar.  The wire houses won&rsquo;t sit idle.</p><p> <strong>  Will they ever come back resurface to have the power they once did? </strong> <br/> IF they do, I simply don&rsquo;t think it can be in the same fashion.  I think the possible scenario where they become the definitive preferred advice providers again is if they can craft an RIA offering that allows their existing FAs to function as true fiduciaries.  And change their culture to embrace and reflect that obligation.  And therein lies the rub.  Doing what&rsquo;s always in a client&rsquo;s best interest is as much about DNA as it is about legal oversight.  We&rsquo;ve witnessed other large brokerage firms offer similar platforms and none of them have really taken off.  Because moving from a &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; mindset to a &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; mindset is onerous, if not outright impossible, when addressing tens of thousands of financial advisors, not just a select few.</p><p> <strong>  What are your predictions for the industry for the next two years? </strong> <br/> Competition will heighten and prompt new fee and revenue models. An RIA-custodian will buy/offer portfolio accounting and performance reporting as part of their standard offer. Prominent IBD &amp; Wire House teams will continue to launch their own RIAs, immediately joining the ranks of the largest tier RIAs.  This will only strengthen the concentration of AUM among the larger firms. More RIA firms will reposition to strategically attract and serve younger mass affluent clients, with or without the help of robo-advisors</p><p> <strong>  What do you enjoy most about your job? </strong> <br/> Helping others fulfill their professional goals and dreams</p><p> <strong>  How do you manage your time with being a mother and maintaining a career? </strong> <br/> Life is a constant balancing act.  Be clear about your priorities.  Know that compromise means that at any given point one priority will lose out to another.  But no priority can lose consistently. When you love what you do, it&rsquo;s not called work.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the one thing we should know? </strong> <br/> I take my work very seriously.  But I don&rsquo;t take myself too seriously &ndash; you have to be able to laugh at yourself.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  One of my greatest assets is my healthy body. </strong></p><p> Without my health, I am of little use to anyone; my family, my company, my community, and the list goes on. So, I have a big responsibility and interest in staying healthy.</p><p> Much of what causes illness is in within our control. The top causes of death are: coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The more important question is; &lsquo;What causes the causes of death?&rsquo; The five most common causes are; stress, smoking, overweight, lack of exercise and excessive drinking.</p><p> Some things can&rsquo;t be controlled (your age, family history of diseases, gender). But others can. And those things aren&rsquo;t a huge surprise &mdash; you already know not to smoke, skip your exercise routine, drink too much, or eat crappy food.</p><p> It&rsquo;s interesting, though, how all of the major diseases are caused by the same things: smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, excessive alcohol and stress.</p><p> Here is a list the habits you may need to change, and a simple way to go about changing them.</p><p> <strong>  The 5 New Habits You May Need to Form </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Reduce stress. </strong> Stress is a risk factor for heart disease and high blood pressure, which is in itself a risk factor for stroke. Learn to be efficient with your time and delegate or eliminate whenever possible those tasks that stress you out. Exercise every day to relieve stress.</p><p> <strong>  2. Exercise. </strong> You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you to exercise, but listen to this: lack of exercise is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, colon &amp; rectal cancers, diabetes, breast cancer, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. If you don&rsquo;t exercise, you&rsquo;re just asking to get a major disease. It&rsquo;s almost a magic pill: do a bit of exercise every day, and you will be healthier. You don&rsquo;t need much &mdash; start with 5 minutes a day in the morning.</p><p> <strong>  3. Drink more water. </strong>  Most people don&rsquo;t drink enough water. Keep water on your desk or at your side at all times and you will find you will be reaching for it more often. Like the old saying goes&hellip;&rdquo;Out of sight, out of mind.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  4. Eat more fruits &amp; veggies. </strong> This is obvious, but it&rsquo;s amazing how few veggies most people eat. Try substituting the pasta or potatoes with broccoli or cauliflower. Eating fruits and veggies reduces your risk of several leading diseases, and it&rsquo;s one of the easiest habits to form. Eat a salad for lunch. Eat fruits with breakfast and as snacks.</p><p> <strong>  5. Monitor your own blood pressure. </strong>  Keeping an eye on our own blood pressure is like watching the oil pressure gauge in your car. It can prevent many major illnesses before they get out of hand. Take responsibility for your own health.</p><p> <strong>  The 5 Old Habits You May Need to Break </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Stop smoking. </strong> This is by far the most important habit, as it affects almost every single one of the leading causes of death. It&rsquo;s also the hardest of these habits to change.</p><p> <strong>  2. Eat less. </strong>  (if you&rsquo;re overweight). The best habit to form to lose weight is to eat less. Or eat more of things that don&rsquo;t have a lot of calories, like fiber, fruits and veggies. Being overweight is just below smoking the worst risk factor for many diseases.</p><p> <strong>  3. Drink less alcohol. </strong> Heavy drinking is one of the worst risk factors for many diseases. That&rsquo;s more than 2 drinks of alcohol a day for men, and more than 1 drink for women. A glass of red wine is a good thing, but too many and you&rsquo;re greatly increasing your risk of disease.</p><p> <strong>  4. Eliminate processed foods. </strong> Eating red meats, and processed meats like sausages, bacon, canned meats and so on, is a risk factor for colon/rectal cancer, stomach cancer, and high cholesterol, which in turn is a leading risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. Try eat stuff that grew on plant, not stuff that was processed in a plant.</p><p> <strong>  5. Reduce salt, and saturated/trans fats. </strong> Salt and saturated or trans fats are in so many processed or prepared foods, and they increase risks of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which increase risk for heart disease and stroke.</p><p> <strong>  How to Form or Break Habits </strong> <br/> This might seem like a lot to change, if you&rsquo;re not already doing these things. However, it is possible!</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how to get started:</p><li> <strong>  Change just one habit at a time. </strong> It doesn&rsquo;t matter which one. Just choose one. You&rsquo;ll want to do more than one, but don&rsquo;t.</li><li> <strong>  Create positive habits you enjoy. </strong> If you enjoy it, the habit change will be easy. Replace smoking with positive habits you enjoy that fulfill the needs that smoking now fulfills. Replace TV time with a walk around the block.</li><li> <strong>  Start as small. </strong> Just do 5 minutes the first week, and try to be consistent as possible. Small change is by far the most effective method for changing habits. Gradual change lasts because it becomes your new habit.</li><li> <strong>  Make it known. </strong> Find a partner or group to change the habit with you. That way you&rsquo;re more likely to stick with it. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Disease is not caused by a single day of unhealthy living. Neither is wellness the result of one day of healthy living. </strong></p><p> Healthy living is possible. It&rsquo;s just doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Comedy legend and TV personality  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers\" target=\"_blank\">   Joan Rivers  </a> </u>  once told  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   TIME  </a> </u>  Magazine, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid of death. I&rsquo;m in show business, I&rsquo;ve died a million times.&rdquo; Sadly, the media icon passed away on September 4, 2014 while undergoing a routine  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy\" target=\"_blank\">   endoscopy  </a> </u> . The procedure, which involves an analysis of the throat while the patient is  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia\" target=\"_blank\">   anesthetized  </a> </u> , was carried out by two experienced physicians.</p><p> What ultimately led to the media icon&rsquo;s death was a spur-of-the-moment decision by the operating doctors to perform a  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy\" target=\"_blank\">   biopsy  </a> </u>  on a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/polyps#Overview1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   polyp-growth  </a> </u>  in Rivers&rsquo; throat. Many in the medical world have explained that surgery, especially on an elderly patient, should be performed in a hospital, not an out-patient care center.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice\" target=\"_blank\">   Medical malpractice  </a> </u>  suspicions aside, the following valuable estate planning lessons can be learned from the life and death of Joan Rivers:</p><p> &middot; All surgeries have risks &mdash; Any type of surgery is invasive. Regardless of how young or old you may be, mistakes and unpredictable complications can arise. Remember, the procedure that ultimately claimed Rivers&rsquo; life was scheduled and routine. Joan drafted and signed her  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   will  </a> </u>  at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/surrogates/\" target=\"_blank\">   Surrogate&rsquo;s Court in New York  </a> </u>  on Nov. 16, 2011.</p><p> &middot;  Power of attorney for health care makes tough decisions easier on loved ones &mdash; Prior to Rivers&rsquo; death she had a vital legal document in place: a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hcpa.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   power of attorney for healthcare  </a> </u> . This document gave  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Rivers\" target=\"_blank\">   Melissa Rivers  </a> </u> , Joan&rsquo;s daughter, the power to make important decisions regarding her mother&rsquo;s care if she became incapacitated or disabled. Eventually, with a <u>     <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/powerofattorney.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   power of attorney  </a> </u>  in place, Melissa made the decision to remove her mother from life support.</p><p> &middot; You can ensure pets, as well as heirs, are taken care of after you are gone &mdash; Over the course of her more than half a century career, Joan Rivers amassed a fortune of $150 million. In her estate plan, Rivers&rsquo; left all her possessions to her daughter Melissa, her grandson Cooper and her four dogs. A  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/planning-for-your-pets-future/pet-trust-primer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pet trust  </a> </u>  ensures that your dog, cat, parakeet or other domestic animal is taken care of after you are gone.  An animal lover her whole life, Rivers&rsquo; once jested that her dogs were better than a husband, &ldquo;Because they didn&rsquo;t leave the toilet seat up&rdquo;.</p><p> &middot; Don&rsquo;t forget charities &mdash; In her life, Joan Rivers supported many charities. Yet she also made sure that the charities she supported in life ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.guidedog.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Guide Dogs for the Blind  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.guildhealth.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jewish Guild Healthcare  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://fightcf.cff.org/site/PageServer?pagename=gs_homepage\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cystic Fibrosis Foundation  </a> </u>  to name a few) received contributions after her death.</p><p> &middot; Specify how your remains should be handled &mdash; You may think it a bit morbid to ponder your demise and how your remains should be laid to rest. However, whether you would like to be  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation\" target=\"_blank\">   cremated  </a> </u>  or buried, it is important that you leave explicit instructions for your heirs. In keeping with the late comedienne&rsquo;s wishes, Joan Rivers&rsquo; body was cremated in  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bergen,_New_Jersey\" target=\"_blank\">   North Bergen, New Jersey  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  By drafting a comprehensive estate plan, Joan Rivers ensured that her family and her dogs were well taken care of after her death.  </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> In a national study, when rating their level of satisfaction  <strong>  women are least satisfied with the financial services industry than any other industry. </strong> This low level of satisfaction leads to a high level of distrust, making  <strong>  your ability to attract and retain women clients even more difficult. </strong></p><p> You see most women you pursue as a client often believe that you only care about her because you want her account. She believes you are only showing interest in her because you want her money.  <strong>  Until you can dispel these notions building her trust can be an uphill battle  </strong> making the process of earning her business a much longer process.</p><p> But,  <strong>  when you can share WHY you care about her as a woman you will immediately gain her trust, respect and the opportunity to earn her business. </strong></p><p> Let me share a real life example that will emphasize the importance of sharing your personal story as to WHY you care about women.</p><p> In my early years as a financial advisor at Smith Barney I remember cold calling a Mr. Solomon, dispensing with the typical industry protocol I quickly changed gears and said;</p><p> &ldquo;You know Mr Solomon my real passion is working with women.&rdquo;</p><p> (This definitely got his attention) I then began to share my story.</p><p> &ldquo;When I was young my Dad was a very good investor, he managed our money well, made good investment decisions and to his credit constantly urged my Mother to become more involved.</p><p> The problem was when my mother did get involved and started attending their review meetings because she couldn&rsquo;t understand the concepts of yield and pe ratio.Concepts that were important to my father) he made her feel stupid and incapable of learning. The worst part was Mr. Solomon, she believed him.</p><p> As a young woman starting a career as a financial advisor women like my mother became my mission. I wanted to create an environment where women felt comfortable asking questions, where they could learn and become more confident in their ability to make important financial decisions. I wanted to create an environment where women felt supported in their efforts to become more engaged with their money. That&rsquo;s why I do what I do.&ldquo;</p><p> After sharing my personal story Mr. Solomon immediately referred three women to my practice, which amounted to $3,000,000 in assets, one of those women referred her fianc&eacute; with another $1.5million and within the year even Mr. Solomon became my client transferring another $1.7million to my charge. I raised $6.2 million in new assets all because I shared my story about why my focus was helping women become more engaged in their financial affairs.</p><p> <strong>  You see when you share your story about why you care about women you inspire trust from more than just women. </strong></p><p> Your story why you care about women can become your most powerful and effective business-building tool.</p><p> <strong>  Most every advisor has a story the question is&hellip; what&rsquo;s yours? </strong></p>",

Your clients&rsquo; children have a mindset of their own and that includes freedom to choose a new advisor. What you have seen as your usual revenue source is going to change. This means advisory firms need to pinpoint a strategy to balance serving existing clients while connecting with young investors or face the chance of losing a large portion of assets.</p><p> Many advisors have shied away from creating a formal plan to reach out to the up and coming generation of investors; assuming the assets will stay within their firm. Other advisors feel that the next generation controls such a small portion of the country&rsquo;s wealth, so why bother now.</p><p> These young investors may not have a pocket full of cash to invest with you now, but the transfer of wealth will take place and it will happen quickly.</p><li> $23 trillion dollars will transfer from Boomers to their children within eight years**</li><li> 71% of Millennials are investing, but just 21% are connected to a financial advisor**</li><li> Millennials will outpace Baby Boomer earnings by 2018***</li><li> Millennials will have $2.5 trillion in spending power by 2018***</li><li> 74% of Millennials say they influence the purchase decisions of other generations*** <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The Fidelity study goes on to show us the differences and similarities of their older counterparts: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Differences </strong></p><li> Gender and ethnicity; two-thirds are female and one-third are non-white</li><li> Collaborative</li><li> Time is on their side to grow assets</li><li> Exhibit higher risk factors <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Similarities </strong></p><li> Want to work hard and invest consistently</li><li> Concerned about financial security, but just as concerned about maintaining their lifestyle in retirement</li><li> Value professional financial advice <br/>  </li><p> Bob Oros of Fidelity says, &ldquo;The study represents a &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; in which advisors must decide if they are &ldquo;ready to serve this segment.

    "content": "<p> Sallie Krawcheck has written a great post over on LinkedIn, called  <u>  Personal Branding 101 </u> . (If you don&rsquo;t know Sallie, you should. Check out her  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallie_Krawcheck\" target=\"_blank\">   Wikipedia page  </a> </u> .)</p><p> I am a big fan of Sallie&rsquo;s groundbreaking work, though I was a bit surprised by the discomfort she expresses with the concept of herself as a personal brand. After all, she&rsquo;s Sallie Krawcheck! Her brand is renown as a woman who has succeeded (and failed) as a leader in the male-dominated financial services industry and she is using that success to open doors for women leaders in all industries through her work in  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ellevate Network  </a> </u> .</p><p> In my experience, women are often less comfortable with the concept of their own personal brand because it conjures images of shameless self-promotion. And as Sallie&rsquo;s article alludes to, women have a greater tendency to want their work to stand on its own and not to have to promote it. Many professional women often undersell themselves and their achievements &ndash; a problem not shared by their male counterparts.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Personal brand is what people say about you when you leave the room.&rdquo; ~Jeff Bezos </strong></p><p> Yet, there is one important aspect of personal branding that Ms. Krawcheck&rsquo;s excellent post misses.</p><p> In the social age, your personal brand is largely defined by what your audience or customers tell each other about you, not what you say about yourself.</p><p> And this gets to the root of what a personal brand is and how to use it most effectively. Once you&rsquo;ve defined your professional mission and personal brand, you need to focus on BEING that brand rather than just talking about it.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-personal-branding-done-right-2.jpg\" width=\"698\"/></p><p> <strong>  BE your brand. </strong></p><p> This is a critically important concept in personal branding that is often overlooked by the skeptics. Personal branding done right is nothing more than living the values that guide your day-to-day business and personal life.</p><p> Perhaps this makes it easier to understand that personal branding is more than just superficial packaging and self-promotion. In fact, it&rsquo;s really most effective if it&rsquo;s none of these things.</p><p> Effective personal branding is understanding your professional mission, harnessing your core values and learning how to infuse that mission and those values into your interactions both offline and in online social networks.</p><p> For more information on defining and activating your personal brand, see  <a href=\"http://jaypalter.ca/2013/07/how-to-build-a-personal-brand-strategy-and-communication-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   How to Build a Personal Brand Strategy and Communication Plan  </u>  . </a></p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christine_tsai\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Christine Tsai  </u> </a></p><p> A few months after my first child was born, I wrote a post likening parenthood to entrepreneurship called &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/18/startuphood-and-parenthood-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Startuphood and Parenthood: Not for the Faint of Heart.  </a> </u> &rdquo; Two and a half years later, I&rsquo;m expecting my second. I was quite guarded about my first pregnancy (especially on social media), so aside from that blog post, I shared very little about the experience. This time around, I&rsquo;ve been much more open about it and felt inspired to write thoughts and observations I&rsquo;ve had over the last few months.</p><p> Given the endless controversy about sexism, women in tech, working moms, women founders, gender roles, etc, I was initially hesitant to write this post. Anything and everything is fuel for someone&rsquo;s fire. However, it&rsquo;s important to be vocal about these things (in a constructive manner, of course) and put it out there. Being a pregnant VC may sound less than desirable, given how male dominated the industry is. You could argue the same applies to tech companies and startups. There are tales of companies not wanting to hire women of a certain age for fear they&rsquo;d get pregnant and be out of commission for a few months. As we see more women running companies, in leadership roles, and also on the other side of the table as investors, this will hopefully become a non-issue.</p><p> Companies like Google and Facebook offer great maternity and paternity leave. However, when you&rsquo;re a startup, it can be nebulous especially if you&rsquo;ve never had a pregnant employee on the team. Many startups don&rsquo;t have a maternity (or paternity) leave policy in place. But as your company grows and/or women on the team have children, this changes. In fact, more than just coming up with a policy, it&rsquo;s absolutely critical to ensure that you retain these employees. The last thing you want is to lose talent because your company culture is a hindrance to parents.</p><p> With that, here are a few tips I&rsquo;ve come up with (in no particular order). My suggestions have more to do with how to treat expectant moms versus how to develop your actual leave policy:</p><p> <strong>  1. Uphold a company culture that supports pregnancy and working parents </strong></p><p> This is first and foremost the most important thing, because once you have this then everything else falls in line. Oftentimes companies (especially small ones, where resources are stark) will view pregnancy as a burden. Some are even reluctant to hire women for that reason, especially married women of childbearing age. Don&rsquo;t be that company. You&rsquo;ll only do yourself a disservice and miss out on amazing talent.</p><p> <strong>  2. Be flexible </strong></p><p> Pregnant women have to somehow make it through the day and also deal with physical changes, unpleasant symptoms of pregnancy, and a barrage of doctors&rsquo; appointments and lab tests that will often happen during work hours. If you need to re-arrange meetings or schedule around your team member&rsquo;s appointments, do it. These appointments are all important and oftentimes are time-sensitive.</p><p> <strong>  3. Do not make assumptions or decisions on her behalf </strong></p><p> We all make assumptions about pregnant women, either based on having been through it directly, indirectly, or pure conjecture. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably too tired to do X,&rdquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to want to travel because she&rsquo;s pregnant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Her due date is Y so she won&rsquo;t want to take this on so I&rsquo;ll ask someone else to do it,&rdquo; etc. While your intentions may be good, this is something every expectant working mom fears &ndash; being phased out. I&rsquo;ll put myself out there and admit this has/is a fear of mine. Let her be the one to decide whether something&rsquo;s too much for her to handle or not. Let her lead the conversation and decision making around what her maternity leave plan is, especially if it has to do with transitioning work and hiring people &ndash; or at the very least, make sure she is directly involved.</p><p> <strong>  4. Assume that pregnancy changes nothing about her role in the company </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ll refrain from opening a can of worms and get into the working mom vs. stay-at-home mom debate. But from personal experience and from the many working moms I know, we&rsquo;d rather that people assume we&rsquo;re going back to work after maternity leave. In fact, some women will actually want to stay plugged in with what&rsquo;s going on while they&rsquo;re on leave. Don&rsquo;t question whether she&rsquo;s returning to the company once the baby arrives. Don&rsquo;t be an asshole and take the position away from her while she&rsquo;s out.</p><p> <strong>  5. Offer awesome maternity leave </strong></p><p> There is a minimum requirement every state mandates for companies (usually of a certain employee size). My 2 cents &ndash; of course companies should comply with what their state law requires. However, depending on the state, it might be rather stingy and it&rsquo;s in your best interest to go above and beyond what you&rsquo;re &ldquo;required&rdquo; to do. Startups may think they can&rsquo;t afford to have an employee out for too long, let alone pay them during that time. But remember that it&rsquo;s temporary and most likely it won&rsquo;t have a significant impact on the bottom line if you were to (for example) provide fully paid leave. Being as generous as possible will go a LONG way in both retaining and attracting talent for both moms and dads. Also, good employees will feel just as invested in making sure things don&rsquo;t go awry while they&rsquo;re out and not leaving teammates in the lurch.</p><p> <strong>  6. Do NOT touch her stomach </strong></p><p> This may seem like common sense. But many people don&rsquo;t get it. Yes, it&rsquo;s not every day you see a round, beach-ball shaped stomach. But think of it this way &ndash; would you touch her stomach if she weren&rsquo;t pregnant?</p><p> <strong>  7. Remember the dads </strong></p><p> Pregnancy is usually all about the mom because she&rsquo;s the one carrying the baby for 9 months. However, realize that expectant dads are going through a lot too. I love the fact that Facebook offers equal leave for moms and dads. Consider that for your company. Offering unequal leaves just reinforces the longstanding notion that parenting responsibilities aren&rsquo;t equal, and that doesn&rsquo;t help anyone.</p><p> <strong>  8. Remember that It doesn&rsquo;t just end with maternity leave </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ve heard of companies offering great maternity/paternity leave, only to be oddly inflexible when it comes to working parents&rsquo; schedules. This all goes back to your company culture. You may have a company where telecommuting, leaving the office early, and working from home are frowned upon. That&rsquo;s your prerogative. But if you want to be more inclusive of working parents, then revisit these policies and make it easier for parents to juggle their two full-time jobs. (Yes, parenting is a full-time job even if you work at a company too) And extra brownie points if you set up a mother&rsquo;s room for moms when they return to the office! (500 did)</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Emily Heaton </u></p><p> The financial services industry regulator has identified 10 types of financial consumers in the UK based on distinct characteristics, attitudes and behaviours. <br/> <br/> Developed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fca-consumer-spotlight.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Consumer Spotlight model  </a> </u>  looks at how we all deal differently with our money and financial services.  <br/> <br/> Financial services firms can now improve their marketing effectiveness by using the information in the model to identify the most attractive customer groups to focus on. <br/> <br/> This information can help firms design products and communications that work well for different, specific consumers. <br/> <br/> Let's take a look.</p><p> <strong>  Today's 10 Types of Financial Consumers </strong></p><li> Retired with resources</li><li> Retired on a budget</li><li> Affluent and ambitious</li><li> Mature and savvy</li><li> Living for Now</li><li> Striving and supporting</li><li> Starting out</li><li> Hard pressed</li><li> Stretched but resourceful</li><li> Busy achievers</li><p> <br/> The data collected by the FCA shows where each of the customer types look for information about financial services and products.   </p><p> Knowing where their target customers are actively looking for advice on the financial products and services they sell will help firms market their messages where they are most likely to be seen.</p><p> <strong>  1. Retired with Resources </strong></p><p> Mostly retired homeowners with no mortgage, living comfortably on income from pensions and savings.</p><p> Risk-averse and careful with their money, this group prefer saving to spending and rarely go overdrawn or take on debt.</p><p> They have high savings and a range of financial products.</p><p> Optimistic and confident, they tend to be well informed and keep abreast of changes in the economy. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Key Issues  </strong></p><li> Less likely than average to have internet access</li><li> Prefer to see information on paper</li><li> Many live alone <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How Firms Can Reach This Group </strong></p><p> In general this group would far rather look at information on paper than via a website (69% agree vs. 43% of the total population) so ebooks and fact sheets that can be downloaded and printed are preferred.</p><p> That said, smartphone ownership is relatively low (15% vs 49% of the total population) and they are less likely to have internet access (63% vs. 76% of the total population) so traditional marketing methods such as printed media and TV should be used to complement internet marketing activities.</p><p> <strong>  2. Retired on a Budget </strong></p><p> The vast majority of this group are over 65.  More than half live alone, with 38% widowed and 16% divorced.</p><p> They have low incomes, with an even split between home ownership and renting from local authorities.</p><p> Members of this group are careful with their money, and tend not to switch providers.  They have limited access to information and services and prefer to use cash or cheques to pay bills.</p><p> <strong>  Key Issues </strong></p><li> Access to information and services can be difficult, with low internet use and transport an issue for some</li><li> Only 10% have income from investments and savings</li><li> Low level of education &ndash; almost half say they have no formal qualifications</li><li> More likely to consult friends and family about financial decisions, but many act without any advice</li><p> <br/> <strong>  How Firms Can Reach This Group </strong></p><p> Accessing information and services is difficult for many.</p><p> This is the segment least likely to have access to the internet (39% vs. 81% of the total population) or a computer of any kind (26% have a laptop vs. 66% of the total population).</p><p> This group is more likely than others to rely on close family for advice. 21% consulted a close relative (other than their partner) when they last opened a bank or building society account (vs. 5% of the total population).</p><p> However, many make decisions on financial products entirely alone (for example, 49% chose home insurance entirely by themselves, vs. 35% of the total population).</p><p> Accessing this group via traditional marketing methods such as via printed media, third party promotions and instore displays will be required.</p><p> <strong>  3. Affluent and Ambitious </strong></p><p> A high-income, working-age group, with most owning their homes (the majority with a mortgage).</p><p> Almost all work full-time, and partners usually work too.</p><p> They are highly educated, with half having a degree or equivalent qualification.</p><p> They are likely to own several financial products.</p><p> Financially confident and likely to shop around, they use the internet as a major source of information.</p><p> <strong>  Key Issues </strong></p><li> Strong preference for accessing information online</li><li> Investors are more likely to have a high risk appetite</li><li> Time-poor</li><li> Less likely to check statements</li><li> More likely to extend a mortgage</li><li> Likely to own a range of financial products</li><li> More likely to have been mis-sold a product</li><li> More likely to have taken out a personal loan <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How Firms Can Reach This Group </strong></p><p> This group has high internet use and accesses information from a range of online sources.</p><p> This segment has a strong bias towards accessing information and products online.</p><p> Almost all have internet access at home (91% vs. 76% of the total population) and most use the internet at least once a day (74% vs. 62% of internet users).</p><p> The majority would rather look at information on a company&rsquo;s website than in a paper leaflet (68% vs. 51% of the total population).</p><p> This group is most likely to have high net worth individuals who are still looking to purchase financial products and members are most easily reached via  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  effective digital marketing </a>  strategies such as blogging and social media.  </p><p> <strong>  4. Mature and Savvy </strong></p><p> Largely middle-aged, with higher incomes than average and the vast majority in full-time work.</p><p> Mostly homeowners, they generally have higher savings, and have a range of financial products.</p><p> They can and will use a number of different sources to research financial products, and make informed decisions.</p><p> A secure and optimistic group, they are often confident enough to select suitable products without consulting a financial adviser.</p><p> <strong>  Key issues </strong></p><li> Less likely than average to pay attention to receipts and statements.</li><li> High confidence in their own financial knowledge. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How Firms Can Reach This Group </strong></p><p> Members of this group are extremely well informed, through a range of digital and traditional channels</p><p> 86% have internet access at home (vs. 76% of the total population) and the majority use the internet at least once a day. <br/> <br/> The majority are happy to access information from companies online, with only 39% preferring to look at a paper leaflet (vs. 43% of the total population). <br/> <br/> Accessing information is relatively easy for this segment; the vast majority can use the internet in private without difficulty (82% vs. 77% of the total population) and most find it at least fairly easy to explain a problem and get help from a company over the phone (78% vs. 70% of the total population). <br/> <br/> They are more likely to use a wide range of information sources when making decisions about financial products, including price comparison and provider websites, newspapers, bank or building society staff and professional advisers.</p><p> Broad digital marketing strategies such as blogging will form an important part of the marketing programme to reach this group.</p><p> <strong>  5. Living for Now </strong></p><p> A younger group with lower incomes, with the majority in employment and 15% studying.</p><p> Most are able to keep up with bills and expenses, but they tend to be less organised than others.</p><p> A fifth have had financial difficulties within the last three years.</p><p> They can access and use the internet easily, but are less confident about financial matters. hey are more prepared to take risks, but less likely to take professional financial advice.</p><p> <strong>  Key Issues </strong></p><li> More likely to take advice from family and friends about financial matters.</li><li> Less informed about finance and the economy than other segments.</li><li> Many lack confidence about making financial decisions.</li><li> Higher risk appetite than average.</li><li> Less likely to switch accounts for better rates.</li><li> Less likely to check statements.</li><li> Much less likely to have insurance and protection products.</li><li> Slightly more likely to owe money to friends or family. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How Firms Can Reach This Group </strong></p><p> Online and internet-savvy, but less informed than others.</p><p> 80% have internet access at home (vs. 76% of the total population), with a third saying they use the internet several times a day (vs. 25% of the total population).</p><p> Almost 60% have a smartphone, compared to just under half of the total population.</p><p> 81% say they can easily find what they&rsquo;re looking for online (vs. 74% of the total population).</p><p> They are more likely to use comparison websites (65% used a comparison site the last time they bought home or car insurance, vs. 58% of the total population).</p><p> They are more likely than average to be influenced by friends and family, particularly parents, and less likely to take professional advice when taking out products.</p><p> For example, only 8% of those deciding what to do with their savings consulted an independent financial adviser (compared with 20% of the total population).</p><p> Social media based digital marketing strategies will be effective in influencing this group.</p><p> <strong>  6. Striving and Supporting </strong></p><p> A busy and pressured group, most work full or part-time, but have low incomes.</p><p> The majority have dependent children, and are more likely than average to be single parents.</p><p> They will take advice about some products, but are more likely to use comparison sites for insurance.</p><p> They are generally risk averse, but tight budgets mean they are more likely to struggle with bills or fall behind with payments.</p><p> <strong>  Key Issues </strong></p><li> Low incomes and low savings</li><li> Less likely to follow financial news about interest rates, taxation or pensions</li><li> Less likely to be paying in to a pension</li><li> Three quarters are likely to feel unsure when making important financial decisions</li><li> Less likely than the average population to check details on statements</li><li> Unlikely to have switched accounts to get better rates</li><li> Less than a third of those with credit cards pay the balance in full each month</li><li> Half are struggling to keep up with bills and commitments</li><li> A fifth will have had financial difficulties in the last year, and a third have had an unauthorised overdraft in the last three year</li><li> Time-poor</li><li> More than a fifth will sometimes splash out on something they can&rsquo;t really afford <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How Firms Can Reach This Group </strong></p><p> This group is comfortable with technology, and seeks advice from a range of sources.</p><p> 80% have an internet connection at home (vs. 76% of the total population) and 57% have smartphones (vs. 49% of total population)</p><p> 55% have used online banking in the past three months (vs. 52% of the total population).</p><p> However, for some products they are more likely to use online information sources. For example, they are more likely than average to use comparison websites for taking out home or car insurance (68% vs. 57% of the total population).</p><p> Digital marketing strategies including blogging, SEO and social media are the most effective way of reaching this group.</p><p> <strong>  7. Starting Out </strong></p><p> A younger group overall, with most under 45 and more than half under 35.</p><p> Confident and optimistic as a group, the majority are single with no children.</p><p> Almost all rent their home, and income is slightly lower than average.</p><p> Three fifths are in work or studying, and there is a high level of education.</p><p> They are technologically advanced, conducting most of their financial affairs online.</p><p> <strong>  Key Issues </strong></p><li> A fifth are students and a fifth are unemployed.</li><li> The internet is their main source of information.</li><li> Unlikely to use comparison sites.</li><li> Less likely to seek professional financial advice (rely on family and friends).</li><li> Less likely to think about long-term finance or switch accounts.</li><li> Higher than average risk appetite.</li><li> Much less likely to have insurance.</li><li> Low savings and investments.</li><li> Only a quarter have pensions.</li><li> More likely to have high credit card balances.</li><li> More likely to struggle with regular expenses and rely on credit. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How Firms Can Reach This Group </strong></p><p> This group is tech-savvy, but they rely on family and friends for advice.</p><p> This segment is among the most technologically advanced. 68% own smartphones (vs. 49% of the total population) and 84% have an internet connection at home (vs. 76% of the total population).</p><p> 76% use the internet as their main source of information for financial matters (vs. 59% of the total population).

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> <strong>  Trade shows are powerful marketing tools for B2B businesses. </strong> But when you&rsquo;ve been focusing your efforts on digital marketing, it can be disorienting to shift suddenly back into face to face marketing.</p><p> Fortunately, the best trade show marketing merges the world of digital marketing and face to face marketing. Customers expect an integrated experience in which they can engage with your company online just as easily as walking into your booth. And the brand that can balance both sides of this marketing coin will reap the biggest benefits. For a real-life anecdote that demonstrates this, read  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/trade-show-marketing-letting-you-down/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this blog  </a> </u>  to hear what we overheard one of our client&rsquo;s prospects say at a trade show.</p><p> With this in mind, here are nine trade show marketing tips you can use to blend your digital marketing efforts with your in-person trade show opportunities.</p><li> <strong>  Create an attendee cheat sheet in advance.  </strong> Create a list of social media profiles of peers and customers you know will be in attendance. During the show, send Tweets and Facebook updates that tag them in the conversation. For an added marketing punch, publish this list on your blog and let other attendees know about it. Then you&rsquo;re responsible for inviting a wide community of users to participate with your brand online.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t forget the folks at home. </strong>  It&rsquo;s often the case that a number of interested parties can&rsquo;t make it to an event for any given reason. Don&rsquo;t leave them out. Find a way to include them by live-tweeting throughout the day, filming parts of trade show events, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/3-trade-show-marketing-tips-convert/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   posting recaps of the day on your company blog  </a> </u> . If you&rsquo;re running promotions or raffles in person, offer an online option to include those who aren&rsquo;t at the event. If you&rsquo;re conducting a product demo at your booth, be sure to make a feed available on your website (and make sure people register to watch online to generate a lead).</li><li> <strong>  Get involved in the event hashtag (  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/b2b-trade-show-tweet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    or start your own   </a>  </u>  ). </strong>  Get the most out of your engagement efforts by focusing your time on established community hashtags. If you post all of your updates as &ldquo;HealthcareEvent2015,&rdquo; but everyone else is using &ldquo;2015HealthcareEvent,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll miss out on those opportunities to have your voice heard. Often times, expo organizers will list event hashtags on their websites prior to the event.</li><li> <strong>  Bring share-worthy swag. </strong>  Spend your swag budget on items that will encourage the recipient to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/brilliant-trade-show-exhibit-ideas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   share the experience with their personal networks  </a> </u> . That might be something so cool it deserves a photo or video, or something so silly that it helps the attendee get into the spirit of the event and snap tons of photos with your branding on them.</li><li> <strong>  Poll your customers digitally. </strong>  Rather than collect feedback via paper slips that turn into a raffle for free trials or discounts, create a short link to a professional form (or Google form) to poll your booth visitors on their thoughts. Don&rsquo;t stick with just reactions to your product or display. Ask wide-reaching industry questions that will provide you with information that can help your future marketing efforts and appeal to your customer&rsquo;s desire to share their opinion.</li><li> <strong>  Use geofencing technology to push to website landing pages. </strong>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.eventrebels.com/geofencing-enrich-meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Geofencing technology  </a> </u>  has a lot of potential for B2B trade shows.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  To be honest, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to market if you have a lot of money to spend. </strong> You can hire a marketing executive, engage one or more advertising and/or creative and/or marketing agencies. You can retain a public relations firm to analyze editorial calendars, pitch story ideas, plan media tours and facilitate introductions to reporters and editors.</p><p> You can also hire a digital marketing firm with experts in the ever-changing world of search engine optimization, search engine marketing, social media marketing, content marketing (webinars, whitepapers, podcasts, video). The list really could go on and on.</p><p> With a big enough budget, you can do all these things. Even more.</p><p> All this can seem downright daunting to small to midsize companies without big marketing budgets. Often, these companies&rsquo; executives and staff end up thinking that effective marketing is a luxury they simply can&rsquo;t afford. They appreciate the benefits of marketing, but have given up on realizing them because they think they&rsquo;re out of reach.</p><p> <strong>  Well, I have good news. No matter how small your company is, no matter how much you have to spend, if you have the time you can make marketing an important contributor to your company&rsquo;s growth and success. </strong></p><p> First off, let&rsquo;s define marketing. For the purposes of this presentation, marketing is everything your company does to make its products or services more visible, more relevant and more valuable to the people who need or want them.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll notice I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; or &ldquo;sponsorships&rdquo; or &ldquo;PR&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s because these things can be a part of your marketing strategy but they don&rsquo;t come anywhere close to describing all that marketing is. Most these things cost money. Sometimes a lot of money, so when business owners start thinking about marketing, they automatically see big dollar signs and move on.</p><p> Today, I want to focus on three enormously important but inexpensive things your company can do starting today to market your company&rsquo;s stuff better. Not all of the tactics I&rsquo;ll describe will be relevant to everyone, but I&rsquo;m hoping that one or two will really click for you and your business.</p><p> <strong>  1. Write Your Story and Tell It </strong></p><p> Recently, I was introduced to the work of Bernadette Jiwa, an Australian blogger, author and marketing guru who I believe has done a brilliant job of distilling the practice of marketing. In her book, &ldquo;The Difference&rdquo;, she provides practical, step-by-step guidance for companies interested in establishing a more meaningful connection with their audience.</p><p> The Difference is a quick but weighty read and I can&rsquo;t recommend it enough. One exercise in particular &ndash; The Difference Map &ndash; is a simple yet revealing tool to help companies reframe themselves and their products to the customers&rsquo; perspective. Insights from the Map can be used to help create your company&rsquo;s story.</p><p> So how does your &ldquo;company&rsquo;s story&rdquo; have anything to do with getting more customers and revenue? Honestly&hellip;everything. When you know your company&rsquo;s story:</p><li> Who You Are</li><li> Why You&rsquo;re There</li><li> How You Got There</li><li> Who You Care About</li><li> The Things You Do For the People You Care About <br/>  </li><p> Your story has the power to engage employees and customers. It can help provide a sense of purpose and common cause.</p><p> Every company has a story. Find yours and tell it &ndash; especially to your employees, the people who bring your company&rsquo;s story to life for your customers. People love to be part of something larger than themselves or their roles. Your company&rsquo;s story can be the talisman where your brand is defined, your culture is preserved and high expectations are reinforced. Stories are &ndash; and have always been &ndash; powerful stuff.</p><p> Bernadette Jiwa&rsquo;s book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bernadette-Jiwa/e/B009E2FZR8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;The Difference&rdquo;  </a> </u>  is available on Amazon for just $6.99, less for your electronic reader. You just need the time and the commitment to see your story telling through.</p><p> <strong>  2. Fix Your Website </strong></p><p> What&rsquo;s the first thing you do when you&rsquo;re thinking about buying a product or hiring a professional? You Google them, right?</p><p> Your site has to look good. Now that you have your company&rsquo;s story, the site should help tell it. It should work on a desktop computer, tablet and smart phone. It should use words sparingly and images and graphics generously. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be fancy. You don&rsquo;t need to write like Hemingway or Tolstoy. You just need to be there, look good, and offer content your customers care about.  <strong>  Remember always&hellip;It&rsquo;s not about what you have to say, it&rsquo;s about what your customers want to hear. </strong></p><p> You can build your own website for free or very cheaply on services like WordPress or SquareSpace. These platforms provide intuitive content management and active online user communities, so it&rsquo;s easy to get the help you need to make your site terrific. When you&rsquo;re ready, you can upgrade your site to self-hosted versions and add plug-ins to support content marketing, lead generation, e-commerce and more. </p><p> This is a classic example of the old Time vs. Money paradox. A professional designer/developer can do this for you, but you should be prepared to spend thousands of dollars for their time and expertise. It&rsquo;s money well spent if you have it. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll need to take the time to do it yourself or task a tech-savvy employee to tackle the project. </p><p> I built my first website and blog on WordPress for free with no classes or coaching and used it for months to help establish my brand and attract my first consulting client. More recently, I hired a small web development start-up to redesign my site for a little over $2,000 using content I developed to tell my company&rsquo;s story. I&rsquo;ll be spending a little more this year as I add functionality for inbound marketing but I&rsquo;ll be in a position to afford it. Your site can and should also adapt as your business grows. </p><p> <strong>  3. Own Your Customers&rsquo; Experience </strong></p><p> Remember what I said about marketing being everything your company does to make your company&rsquo;s products and services more visible, relevant and valuable? Your customers&rsquo; experiences with your company are a HUGE part of that, whether they&rsquo;re calling you on the phone, visiting your website, coming into the office or stopping by to shop.</p><p> I belong to a big, shiny, new health club. The old, dumpy one closed (alas!). The company clearly spent a lot of money. They&rsquo;re spending a lot more money to attract and convert hundreds of new members. Yet, when I walk in the door each morning, I&rsquo;m lucky if I get a hello, let alone some eye contact and smile. That&rsquo;s not okay!</p><p> This is frustratingly common! How many businesses have you patronized where big money is being spent on facilities, infrastructure, marketing and staff, yet there is no investment at all (in time or money) on training to enhance the customer&rsquo;s experience. Research has shown that word of mouth is the most persuasive form of marketing. And the power of word-of-mouth has been magnified many times over by social media and online resources such as Yelp and Angie&rsquo;s list.</p><p> Do some research. If your customers aren&rsquo;t saying great things about their experiences with your company, you need to find out why and come up with ways to fix it.</p><p> There you have it, three free-to-cheap strategies to make a big dent in your marketing challenges:</p><li> Crafting a story that you, your employees and your customers can believe in,</li><li> Telling that story on a website that looks like you mean business, and</li><li> Being deliberate about they ways your customers experience your company &ndash; EVERYWHERE they touch you. <br/>  </li><p> With these basics in place, a world of low-cost marketing strategies open up. Starting next week I&rsquo;ll be sharing some of those strategies with you. In the meantime, I hope you&rsquo;ll let me know if you have any questions for me or my other readers. I&rsquo;d love to know how your marketing is going and would love to help.</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "how-to-tackle-your-debt-the-debt-snowball-vs-the-debt-avalanche",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When you&rsquo;ve racked up debt across multiple loans, being debt-free seems like a distant dream. But it&rsquo;s possible! The first step is to create a repayment plan that will work for you.</p><p> There are many ways to  <u>  get out of debt </u> , but the two most popular methods are the debt snowball and the debt avalanche. Both plans involve aggressively paying down one balance while making the minimum payments on the rest. The difference lies in what order you tackle the debts.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s dig into the differences to see what plan would work best for you.</p><p> <strong>  The Debt Snowball </strong></p><p> With the debt snowball, you  <u>  pay off your debt </u>  from the smallest to the largest balance. Financial radio show host Dave Ramsey has advocated this method for years.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you have the following debts:</p><li> Credit Card 1: $500 at 3.9% ($25 minimum payment)</li><li> Credit Card 2: $1,000 at 8% ($50 minimum payment)</li><li> Credit Card 3: $3,000 at 21.99% ($100 minimum payment)</li><li> Credit Card 4: $12,000 at 18.9% ($200 minimum payment) <br/>  </li><p> Let&rsquo;s say you cut your expenses and freed up $300 each month in your budget. By allocating this money entirely towards the lowest balance, you pay off your first loan in less than two months!</p><p> Then, put the minimum payment from that debt once it&rsquo;s eliminated ($25) and the money you freed up in your budget ($300) together. Your debt snowball is now $25 larger.</p><p> You can now put $325 per month towards that second debt  (in addition to the $50 minimum payment you&rsquo;re already making) for a total of $375 until it too is eliminated in just over a few months. And so the debt snowball grows until all the debt is paid.</p><p> <strong>  The Benefits of the Debt Snowball </strong></p><p> With the debt snowball, the focus is on  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/15-ultra-inspiring-kick-ass-money-quotes-to-keep-your-finances-in-tact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   motivating good habits  </a> </u> . By concentrating on the smallest balances, you get a small win right at the beginning of the journey.</p><p> It&rsquo;s wonderful to pay off a credit card and know you no longer have that monthly payment. That quick succession of small wins helps you to stay the course and  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-pay-down-debt-as-a-couple/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   dump all your debt  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  The Shortcomings of Debt Snowball </strong></p><p> Since the debt snowball focuses on balances instead of interest rates, it&rsquo;s entirely possible you won&rsquo;t tackle the largest interest rate card right away. This means you will pay more in interest with the debt snowball than with the debt avalanche. It also means it might take a few more months to get out of debt.</p><p> If you can&rsquo;t stand the thought of paying extra interest, the debt avalanche might work better for you.</p><p> <strong>  The Debt Avalanche </strong></p><p> With the debt avalanche, you pay the debts down from highest interest rate to lowest interest rate. Compare this to the debt snowball method above.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what that list of debts looks like, in the order you&rsquo;ll pay them off, if you&rsquo;re using the debt avalanche method:</p><li> Credit Card 1: $3,000 at 21.99% ($100 payment)</li><li> Credit Card 2: $12,000 at 18.9% ($200 payment)</li><li> Credit Card 3: $1,000 at 8% ($50 payment)</li><li> Credit Card 4: $500 at 3.9% ($25 payment) <br/>  </li><p> If you apply the same extra $300 to your debts every month, you&rsquo;d send it to the $3,000 loan with the 21.99% interest rate first. Since the balance is larger, it takes eight months instead of two to pay off the first card completely.</p><p> But over time, you&rsquo;ll pay less towards your debt because you eliminate the most costly interest rates immediately. The math often makes much more sense with the debt avalanche, but  <u>  it does take more discipline </u>  because it takes longer to see big results.</p><p> <strong>  The Benefits of the Debt Avalanche </strong></p><p> Again, with the debt avalanche method you pay less in interest. If you have a large debt with a high interest rate, this strategy can save a substantial sum in interest.</p><p> Also, if you have two loans that are just about the same balance, you might as well tackle the higher interest rate first to  <u>  save some money </u> .</p><p> <strong>  The Shortcomings of the Debt Avalanche </strong></p><p> With the debt avalanche, it often takes a bit longer to pay off the first debt. In the example above, it takes six additional months to eliminate a payment. And the second credit card takes a total of 24 months including the six months of minimum payments before you get the extra amount rolled in from paying off card one.</p><p> If the long slog is discouraging, the debt snowball might help you  <u>  stay motivated to complete the journey </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Tackle Your Debt </strong></p><p> Consider your own personality and your own debt situation to determine the best method for tackling your debt. Even though the debt avalanche is less expensive, it&rsquo;s more important to take consistent action over time so you can reach debt freedom.</p><p> Remember, you can always use a bit of both methods.  If you are motivated after tackling the smallest balance, you can switch to paying the higher interest rate card. Then switch back to the lowest balance if you find yourself losing motivation.</p><p> Regardless of the debt repayment method you choose, there are other strategies for paying down the balance.</p><p> Consider making biweekly payments instead of monthly payments. You&rsquo;ll add in two extra payments this way. You can also look into a balance transfer. You might be eligible for a lower interest card if you&rsquo;ve been paying down your debt consistently. Just make sure you don&rsquo;t add any more to the new card!</p><p> Debt freedom is possible.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I've long said that the key to a productive and successful sales and service model is three-pronged. The professional that hits high levels of production and stays at high levels of production must:</p><li> <strong>  Be a student of the market they serve. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Be a student of the sales process, that is, the human and political stages in which clients and prospects find themselves throughout the relationship. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Create \"likeability\" with clients and prospects, and ultimately, that likeability must lead to \"trustability.\" </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Because of that three-pronged approach, I have created deeper, more purposeful relationships in my own practice and taught others how to do the same in theirs.</p><p> Look, I know you're busy. I've been where you are. Not only have I heard the excuses, I've used them myself. Life is a juggling act, but it's time to rid your self of the feeling that disaster will strike if one ball falls. Find your footing. Be purposeful in your choices. Be honest. When you think about your average day, how much time do you spend on your business? You read the paper to stay up on trends, watch the news for the latest numbers, but how much time do you devote to your professional goals? What plans do you make for cultivating and strengthening relationships? You must have a daily practice. Make this reflection part of your morning ritual. Every day, focus on how you can better meet the needs of your clients, encourage workplace production, and foster an environment that promotes happiness. In other words, think about opportunities to go face to face. <strong>  You can succeed in sales if you are liked. You will succeed in lifelong, multigenerational sales if you are trusted.  </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  INTRODUCTION </strong></p><p> If you work for a company, especially a technology company, you likely signed an employment agreement which assigns all of your inventions to the company. Many creative people devote much of their lives to thinking, solving problems, and working to make their companies better; however, it may come to pass that an employee begins to wonder what it would be like to be an entrepreneur based on their own ideas and inventions. Understanding the proper time to exit your current employer, or not, is critical if you intend to ideate and invent for your own personal gain or for a company you may start.</p><p> <strong>  IDEATION AND INVENTION NOT IN YOUR EMPLOYER&rsquo;S AREA OF BUSINESS </strong></p><p> Unless you have signed a very unusual agreement with your employer any ideas you develop on your own time, in your own place, and with your own resources that DO NOT involve the employer&rsquo;s area of business are almost certainly yours. However, if there are any questions about potential ownership you should consult an attorney who has specific knowledge of employment law. In these situations, which are not at all unusual, you can continue working for your current employer.</p><p> <strong>  PROBLEM DISCOVERY IN YOUR EMPLOYER&rsquo;S AREA OF BUSINESS </strong></p><p> Often the discovery of problems with existing technology or products occurs from a person&rsquo;s employment activities (current or past). As the company typically &ldquo;owns&rdquo; an employee&rsquo;s ideas, innovations, [1]  and inventions by virtue of an employment agreement, the person intending to intellectually pursue his or her own new innovations and products in the area of the current employer&rsquo;s business should immediately quit that company, lest the issues of idea ownership and conflict of interest arise. You can then continue following the guidelines below.</p><p> <strong>  INVENTION IN YOUR FORMER EMPLOYER&rsquo;S AREA OF BUSINESS </strong></p><p> A departed employee is well advised to allow some period of time to lapse between his/her date of resignation and any subsequent invention activity that may be documented (and discoverable) in writing or the verbal expressions to others. [2]</p><p> Many types of discoverable records may be purposefully or inadvertently created. For instance, even months prior to departure, the employee may be tempted to copy digital files, send e-mail information home, etc. These are all discoverable records after the fact and may create problems for the former employee if he/she continues to work in the areas of the former employer. Even notes compiled by the former employee after leaving the company may inadvertently include trade secrets and data of the former employer that would be revealing of the new entrepreneur&rsquo;s intentions.</p><p> To avoid the issues that are presented by a person&rsquo;s anticipated future departure, the best policy is to not copy or transmit any information to external devices before departure and refrain from immediately creating written records after departure.Essentially, take nothing when you leave. Of course, your future plans are your business and need not be revealed to any current employer.</p><p> In conducting further thinking and work, the would-be entrepreneur must painstakingly avoid any prior employer&rsquo;s intellectual property (IP) in process, trade secrets, product and marketing strategies, and business implementations. Failure to avoid any actual or perceived theft of the prior company&rsquo;s underlying technology and prospective IP places the entrepreneur at great risk for being sued.</p><p> As what constitutes theft is based on the prior employer&rsquo;s judgment and suspicions, it is dangerous territory for the former employee to venture anywhere near the former company&rsquo;s technology and nascent patent positions.</p><p> <strong>  FREEDOM TO INVENT AND INVESTORS </strong></p><p> From an inventor&rsquo;s or entrepreneur&rsquo;s perspective, the goal is to avoid any conflicts or gray areas with a former employer that could obstruct the entrepreneur&rsquo;s eventual search for, and securitization of, investment. Even better is for the former employee to leave on good terms with the former employer.</p><p> The issue of being free to invent can become an important issue for future investors; indeed, if there is even a hint of potential impropriety on the part of the inventor or entrepreneur, investors will quickly disappear. However, once the inventor or entrepreneur is &ldquo;free,&rdquo; so to speak, of the former employer, the entrepreneur has the freedom to pursue his/her own ideas and intellectual thoughts.</p><p> After a reasonable period of time has elapsed, an inventor can and should establish a record of independent research, investigation, and invention for his/her ideas and innovations. And, of course, patent applications should properly acknowledge the patents and products of others and claims should scrupulously avoid infringing on the claims of others.</p><p> <strong>  FINAL THOUGHTS </strong></p><p> It may seem paranoid to have to think so carefully about the issue of who owns an idea. Inventors and entrepreneurs, however, should have a keen awareness of the debilitation affects of legal conflicts with past employers in regards to intellectual property. They also need to realize the impact on future investors by improperly exiting from a prior employer . Properly handled in accordance with law and ethical propriety and with a little patience, inventors can establish a clean starting point for their new venture.</p><p> Footnotes</p><p> [1]  An employee&rsquo;s ideas and innovations not related to the employer&rsquo;s business are solely owned by the inventor provided they are not developed on company time or in company facilities or with company resources.</p><p> [2]  Consult a corporate attorney if there is even the slightest concern or potential for conflict with a former employer.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I was 26 when my career changed forever.</p><p> A new law passed that completely upended how our clients handled health care&mdash;and as the junior consultant, I was selected to become the &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in our Chicago office.</p><p> I pored over hundreds of pages&mdash;the law itself and detailed analyses by our crack team of attorneys. I traded insights with my counterparts in other offices. As my confidence grew, I was excited to start briefing actual clients. Since the issue was heating up in the marketplace, the practice leader decided to host an in-office client briefing and asked me to be the presenter.</p><p> It would be my first ever stint at the podium. Even now, I can still feel the alternating waves of thrill and nausea.</p><p> All was well until the acceptances started rolling in. Typically we&rsquo;d get maybe 30 at an office briefing, spiking up to 50 on something hot. We had over 120.</p><p> The senior consultants were openly panicked that a hot client event would be led by the greenest member of the team. (I later learned they&rsquo;d wanted me replaced but were overruled.) So a last-minute group practice session to test my client-readiness was hastily arranged.</p><p> The day before the 8 A.M. presentation, I took my slides and my notes into a small dark room to rehearse before the leadership team. Who proceeded to spend the next five hours critiquing, changing, arguing amongst themselves and (sometimes viciously) tearing apart my deck. When it was finally over, I was up until 2 A.M., revising, rehearsing and mostly praying I wouldn&rsquo;t suck.</p><p> I didn&rsquo;t.</p><p> 107 people showed up that day (yes, I counted) and we had a lively discussion about the meaning of the new law. Could I have been better? No doubt. But I was candid, prepared and most of all&mdash;me.</p><p> The sometimes mean-spirited grilling session (which was part of the culture of that firm) was in hindsight a pure gift because it gave me an early, valuable lesson: it wasn&rsquo;t about me, but about the clients. About how even landmark legislation isn&rsquo;t about the content, but what you do with it. About how you help your clients to be wiser than they were an hour ago.</p><p> The clients gave the session rave reviews. Word spread and the senior consultants were quick to take me to meetings. It wasn&rsquo;t long before I was speaking outside the firm (the birth of my speaking career) and snagging some national podium time. Locally, the visibility parlayed into becoming President of an 800-member industry association, all before the ripe old age of 30.</p><p> So why am I telling you this story?</p><p> Because it was the start of building my  authority platform .</p><p> Being an expert on a technical subject happened to be the price of my admission. It fueled my ascent onto a national industry stage and allowed me to broaden both my expertise and my reach. Today, I command premium pricing doing work that speaks to me.</p><p> My trip was an occasionally twisty journey, chock-full of lessons I want to make sure you don&rsquo;t have to learn the hard way.</p><p> Because building an authority platform is the single most powerful client attraction move you can make.</p><p> The right platform works on your behalf 24/7, constantly sending out the message that you are a force to be reckoned with.</p><p> But what is the best strategy&mdash;not to mention the highest-impact tactics&mdash;to build the right one-of-a-kind authority platform for you?</p><p> Enter Instant Authority: four weeks of focused on-line training where I&rsquo;ll walk you through the steps to create and amplify your unique authority platform.</p><p> The news? On March 25th, I&rsquo;m launching the inaugural course.</p><p> I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing more of that with you shortly. But for now, be thinking about your authority platform and how it fits with where you most want to take yourself. </p>",

    "content": "<p> A bakery on the outskirts of Manhattan, a health and beauty products manufacturer in Brazil and a telecommunications provider in Afghanistan may not, on the surface, appear to have much in common. But they share at least one important trait: <strong>  they&rsquo;re part of a growing group of companies that are building a new business model called the B Corporation that&rsquo;s based on the idea that business is uniquely equipped to help solve society&rsquo;s problems rather than cause them.   </strong></p><p> B Corporations &ndash; the &ldquo;B&rdquo; stands for Benefit -- are not not-for-profit organizations, nor are they variant forms of a corporate social responsibility program. <strong>  They are full-fledged, for-profit businesses that have committed to create and be accountable for specific social benefits. </strong> On the surface, this may not seem terribly revolutionary. But unlike other public companies, whose principal responsibility is usually defined in terms of financial results, &ldquo;executives at B-corps are also required to consider nonfinancial interests when they make decisions,&rdquo; explains Financial Journalist Felix Salmon. &ldquo;The company has to create a material positive impact on society and the environment.&rdquo;</p><p> That means that if a firm like Greyston Bakery, in Yonkers, NY, wants to invest to provide housing, child care and job training programs for its community, it can do so without fear of violating any of its fiduciary responsibilities as a corporation or, if it were a public company, of attracting lawsuits from investors who want financial growth no matter what. As it happens, while contributing to its community, Greyston also sold more than $11 million worth of baked goods in 2013 (the most recent year for which audited sales figures are available). Some of that dough comes from the sale of brownies that go into ice cream made by Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s -- a Greyston customer for nearly 25 years. Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s is a B Corp (and also, as it happens, a part of consumer products giant Unilever).</p><p> Warby Parker, the eyeglass brand founded in 2010 and named by Fast Company magazine as the most innovative company of 2015, is a B Corp. For every pair of glasses they sell, Warby Parker makes a donation to a not for profit partner that in turn makes eyecare (and other benefits) available around the world to people with impaired vision. Children and adults who have trouble seeing will also have trouble learning and finding work, to name just two challenges. Outdoor gear maker Patagonia, practically the archetype of the socially and environmentally responsible corporation, is a B Corp. Seventh Generation, which makes toxin-free household cleaning, paper, and personal care products, is a B Corp. And so is Etsy, the Brooklyn-based online marketplace that generated $196 million in revenues last year. Soon, along with handcrafted items from around the world, consumers will be able to buy Etsy stock: the company filed for an initial public offering on the NASDAQ earlier this month.</p><p> In fact, the B list includes every imaginable kind of businesss, from dairies to law firms and from energy companies to investment managers. Every one of them has a compelling concept for marrying profit and purpose. But the B Corp vision of business as a force for good goes well beyond feel-good marketing. Indeed, gaining the designation requires not only a sincere commitment but also a strenuous effort. A nonprofit organization called B Lab ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.bcorporation.net  </a> </u> ) certifies companies that measure up to the demanding standards of its B Impact Assessment tool. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for registrants to try a few times before achieving a passing score of 80 out of 200 &ndash; based on detailed evaluations of governance, relationship with workers, community impact and environmental performance.</p><p> Becoming a Certified B Corp typically also means making specific legal changes which, among other things, give directors and officers the latitude to consider the interests of all stakeholders and not just shareholders. Pass or fail, the assessment process helps companies identify ways to improve their practices (instructive <u>  <a href=\"http://bimpactassessment.net/case-studies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   case studies  </a> </u> -- including efforts that fall short -- are available on the B Lab website). To maintain their certification, B Corps must report publicly on their performance and recertify every two years. </p><p> The process should be tough, argues Jay Coen Gilbert, who co-founded the B Lab with partners Bart Houlahan and Andrew Kassoy. The &ldquo;Certified B Corp&rdquo; endorsement does for corporations what the organic label does for produce or the LEED certification does for buildings. &ldquo;When everybody claims to be a conscious company, it is hard to know who is for real,&rdquo; he recently told Conscious Company magazine. &ldquo;B Corp certification helps you identify those companies that are not just conscious in their words, but conscious in their deeds.&rdquo; </p><p> B Lab officially opened its doors in July of 2006. The following June it announced the first 19 companies to gain certification. Today, there are more than 1,200 certified B Corps in 38 countries and 121 industries. In the U.S., home to about 70% of them, 26 states and the District of Columbia have also passed legislation that permits companies to register as &ldquo;Benefit Corporations&rdquo; &ndash; similar to a B Corp but minus the certification. Legislation is expected in the near future in another 14 states.</p><p> If becoming a B Corp is good for society, it also appears to be good for business. In his book &ldquo;Profit &amp; Purpose, How social innovation is transforming business for good,&rdquo; Attorney and Social Entrepreneur Kyle Westaway summarizes a number of studies that show that companies that have integrated social benefits into their business models</p><li> tend to outperform market indices like the S&amp;P 500</li><li> weather financial downturns more successfully</li><li> build stronger brands</li><li> generate higher customer and employee loyalty. <br/>  </li><p> Indeed, it seems beyond question that &ldquo;a new type of company that uses the power of business to solve social and environmental problems,&rdquo; as B Lab puts it, is an idea whose time has come. Certifications have grown steadily, from 34 in 2008 to 372 in 2014. What&rsquo;s more, in addition to the certified B Corps themselves, more than 16,000 companies are using the B Impact Assessment free of charge as a management tool.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s hope this is just the beginning. The traditional approach of depending on government, NGOs and philanthropy to solve social problems just doesn&rsquo;t work, concludes Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter in his 2013 <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_porter_why_business_can_be_good_at_solving_social_problems?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TED  </a> </u> talk, because they can&rsquo;t achieve the necessary scale. Only business can. Addressing social problems with a business model &ndash; with what he calls &ldquo;a higher kind of capitalism&rdquo; -- is actually a huge business opportunity, he believes. The question is, how to get corporations to recognize it.</p><p> In the second part of this article, we&rsquo;ll examine some possible answers.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Oil inventories have been growing lately, as you know if you've been reading this blog: </strong> We now have 450 million barrels on hand, versus an available physical storage capacity (in the U.S.) of 521 million barrels. Most major (and many smaller) oil companies have made drastic cuts to CapEx expenditures for 2015, which means less exploration and new drilling. Which should slow the pile-up of crude stocks, right? <br/> <br/> Wrong. It's true that many less-productive rigs are being idled. As of a week ago, only 866 rigs were still active in the U.S., down almost 50% from October, when they&rsquo;d peaked at 1,609. But here's the nasty little secret most people outside of the oil industry don't know: Many small to midsize producers have no way to service their debt except to sell oil. Therefore, most are continuing to bring oil to market as fast as they can (but also as cheaply as they can, using only the most efficient rigs). In fact, the cheaper oil becomes, the more oil these producers have to bring to market to service their debt. Hence, production will only continue to skyrocket.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/US-oil-production-rig-count-2014-2015-Mar13.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> Some indication of how serious the situation is can perhaps be garnered from the  <u>  <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL1N0WF1VI20150313\" target=\"_blank\">   surprise announcement last Friday  </a> </u>  that the U.S. government will buy 5 million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Just a year ago, the Dept. of Energy caught oil markets off guard with a \"test sale\" of 5 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Thus, the Dept. of Energy has gone from selling oil to being a buyer of reserve oil, in one year.  <br/> <br/> It will have little effect, in any case. While 5 million barrels may sound like a lot of oil, it represents only one week's additional inventory surplus, or half a day of production. Unless the government decides to buy this much oil every week, we're looking at a continued pile-up of 4 to 7 million barrels of surplus oil per week, meaning we might be just 10 weeks away from hitting the absolute storage limit of 521 million barrels. As we approach that limit, oil prices will fall, perhaps precipitously, and some producers will default on their debts, a process that has  <u>  <a href=\"http://wolfstreet.com/2015/03/05/default-monday-oil-gas-companies-face-their-creditors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   already begun  </a> </u> . <br/>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/berkun\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Scott Berkun  </u> </a> The recent Buzzfeed post by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/curtissittenfeld\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Curtis Sittenfeld  </a> </u>  called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/curtissittenfeld/things-no-one-ever-tells-you-about-the-publishing-industry\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   24 Things No One Tells You about Publishing  </a> </u>  was fun to read. I&rsquo;ve written  <u>  <a href=\"https://scottberkun.com/books/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   6 popular books  </a> </u>  with two publishers and I agreed with much of what she said. But having been an author for a decade and hearing every question and myth, here&rsquo;s my own list of things I wish more  people knew about writing and publishing.</p><li> <strong>  Selling books is harder than writing them. </strong>  There are  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per_year\" target=\"_blank\">   300k books published in the U.S.  </a> </u>  every year. And  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-decline-of-the-american-book-lover/283222/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   30% of Americans read only 1 to 5 books in 2014  </a> </u> . Writing a book is purely up to you. But getting other people to buy and read your book is another matter.</li><li> <strong>  Everyone obsesses about titles and covers but   <u>   <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2012/the-truth-about-picking-book-titles/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    it&rsquo;s hard to prove their impact   </a>  </u> </strong>  beyond above a basic level of quality. It&rsquo;s easy to find popular books with lousy titles and covers, and unpopular books with great titles and covers. There are too many variables for magic answers. Publishers exert more control over titles and covers than you&rsquo;d expect: often authors have little say.</li><li> <strong>  Some books, like   <u>   <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743273567/scottberkunco-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    The Great Gatsby   </a>  </u>   or   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553213113/scottberkunco-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Moby Dick   </a>  </u>  , don&rsquo;t become popular until decades after publication. </strong> It&rsquo;s a strange world. Books have lives of their own, typically quiet ones. We judge success by sales, but many factors that have nothing to do with the book itself impact sales. Bestseller lists are not a meritocracy. Sometimes a book is on the bestseller list for a week and never heard of again. Other times a book has steady sales for years but never makes any lists or wins any awards.</li><li> <strong>  Your reasons for writing must transcend fame and wealth </strong>  as neither are likely from writing alone. Most books you read are written by writers who pay their rent through other means. If you want fame and wealth from writing be committed to the long term. This takes the pressure off each book, and you&rsquo;ll be open to learning instead of foolishly trying to hit a grand slam on your first try.</li><li> <strong>  Fame will likely ruin your writing or your life. </strong> Study the history of famous writers if you doubt me. Fast fame is a curse, or a trap, as everyone wants you to repeat exactly what you did before.</li><li> <strong>  The publishing industry is slow to realize   <u>   <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2013/self-publish-or-not/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    authors need them less than ever   </a>  </u>  . </strong>  Unlike 20 years ago, you can do much of what a publisher does yourself, perhaps not as well, but that depends on how entrepreneurial and self aware you are.  <u>  <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2011/confessions-of-a-self-published-author/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn about self-publishing  </a> </u>  simply to be informed about your business end to end. Some publishers do great work, but many are stuck in an antiquated notion of their value.</li><li> <strong>  Many authors are lazy. </strong>  They&rsquo;re arrogant too. They don&rsquo;t want to do PR, they don&rsquo;t want to do their homework and they are in denial of how many other  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/08/are-there-too-many-books/244001/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   authors there are  </a> </u> . They, like some publishers, believe in romantic notions of how publishing works.</li><li> <strong>  Some publishers/editors/agents are amazing. Some are bad and incompetent. </strong>  YMMV. Don&rsquo;t judge them all by the one you worked with. My agent,  <u>  David Fugate </u> , is awesome.</li><li> <strong>  A great editor at a mediocre publisher can be a better situation </strong>  than a mediocre editor at a great publisher. Editors represent you for dozens of decisions the publisher makes for your book that you can&rsquo;t participate in.</li><li> <strong>  Many editors don&rsquo;t &ldquo;edit&rdquo;. </strong>  They&rsquo;re more like strategists or strategic project managers. There are three roles editors play, often played by different people. Acquisitions editors sign authors. Development editors help you draft your book. Production editors are the ones who spend the most time with your words, and even they depend on  <u>  <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2009/what-copyediting-looks-and-feels-like/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   copyeditors  </a> </u>  and proofreaders. Many people will touch your book.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t believe everything depends on finding agents or publishers. </strong>  They both want you to already have a fan base, which is a paradox. There are many paradoxes to face in trying to break into any field that many people want to be in (e.g. being a movie star). To find an agent requires hard work and this is on purpose. There is a far greater supply of people writing books than demand from publishers.</li><li> <strong>  Always remember you can </strong>   <u>  <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2013/self-publish-or-not/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   upload a PDF of your book to Amazon and have it on sale on Kindle in minutes  </a> </u> . Don&rsquo;t get lost falsely depending on others. No one can stop you from writing a book and selling it except yourself. Promoting a book well is another matter (see #1), but publishers struggle with that too.</li><li> <strong>  No one will come to your book reading/signing unless you are already famous. </strong> The packed author readings on the news are only packed because the author is already very well known. It&rsquo;s another paradox related to #1. Read  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DMIWAIC/scottberkunco-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The First 1000 copies  </a> </u>  by  <u>  <a href=\"http://outthinkgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tim Grahl  </a> </u> , or  <u>  <a href=\"http://apethebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   APE  </a> </u>  by  <u>  <a href=\"http://guykawasaki.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Guy Kawaksai  </a> </u>  for a good start on how to market books. Book readings at bookstores are among the worst uses of time for a new author.</li><li> <strong>  Publishers only invest in big PR for famous authors. </strong> For new authors there&rsquo;s little reason to believe the investment will pay off. Would you spend 50% of your annual marketing budget on an unknown? Neither would a publisher. Publishers do love authors who invest their own time and money in marketing, and will help with and add to your investment.</li><li> <strong>  Most people think they want to write </strong> , but  <u>  <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2010/why-you-fail-at-writing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   really they just like to think about writing  </a> </u> . If you have a 6th grade education you know how to write. The question is are you willing to put in the hours?</li><li> <strong>  You can spot these people because they spend more time complaining </strong>  about how hard it is to write than doing it. Or they endlessly stroke their idea as if it can someday magically transform itself into 300 pages. Don&rsquo;t complain. No one is making you torture yourself but you.</li><li> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2014/the-distraction-free-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Distractions say more about your lack of commitment than anything else   </a>  </u> </strong> . Learn to concentrate. Concentration is a skill anyone can develop and if you are serious about writing you should see this as central to your ambitions. If you were starving to death and writing a book would get you food, you&rsquo;d write. We are all capable of writing if suitably motivated.</li><li> <strong>  Which means that anyone with sufficient commitment can write a book. </strong>  It might not be a good book, but most books by published authors aren&rsquo;t that good either. What makes for a good book is highly subjective anyway.</li><li> <strong>  A publisher is a venture capitalist. </strong>  They are giving you money before your work is done. Before you complain about the size of the investment they are willing to make (or not make) in your book, are you are willing to make the same financial investment? Few authors are. It&rsquo;s a business. They owe you nothing beyond what they agree to.</li><li> <strong>  Your friends, family and colleagues are you best assets </strong>  for finding an audience for your writing. Everyone has friends and family. Ask for their help. Make it easy for them to help you. Reward every new fan as if they were your only fan (because at first they will be).</li><li> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2013/how-to-get-better-feedback/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Learn to take feedback well   </a>  </u>  . </strong>  By this I mean you want to be a better writer on the next book than this one, yes? That only happens if you listen for ways to improve. Arrogant writers, and they are legion, rarely improve.</li><li> <strong>  Learn to take rejection well. </strong>  It will be everywhere. If you think rejections from agents and publishers are tough, wait till you get rejected by reviewers and readers (e.g.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0743273567/ref=acr_dpx_hist_1?ie=UTF8&amp;filterBy=addOneStar&amp;showViewpoints=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Great Gatsby has 235 1 star reviews  </a> </u> ). Look for a nugget of merit in every mean-spirited critique you hear as the mean people might have more honest insight into your work than the nicer people. Be grateful anyone read your book at all.</li><li> <strong>  Stop looking for secrets and tricks. </strong>  You&rsquo;re a sucker if you think there&rsquo;s a trick as every great writer in history never found one that let them skip the work. Tips only help if you are writing every day and can put tips to use.</li><li> <strong>  You build a following, or in publishing jargon, a platform, by publishing regularly. </strong>  There is no magic place where people will come to you just for showing up once. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you publish, but put something into the world regularly. Be willing to learn as you go and experiment. There are many ways to build an audience but they all require effort.</li><li> <strong>  Publish once a week on a blog. </strong> You want to build an audience before your book is finished, not after. Write briefly about topics that relate to your book. Share excerpts and ideas you&rsquo;re working on. Read other bloggers who write about subjects like yours and get to know them. Invite people you know to be interested to follow along. It will feel weird at first but work to get comfortable with being visible and making connections, as you&rsquo;ll need those skills when your book is out in the world.</li><li> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2013/dont-be-precious-with-your-ideas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Don&rsquo;t be precious   </a>  </u>  . </strong>  No one is going  <u>  <a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/2010/is-your-book-idea-good/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   to steal your ideas  </a> </u> . Ideas are easy, it&rsquo;s the work of delivering on an idea in 300 pages that&rsquo;s hard.</li><li> <strong>  Get feedback on your ideas and drafts early. </strong>  Find people who are honest with you &ndash; they are hard to find. Grand praise of your drafts does not make them better. Separate useful critiquing (&ldquo;this section didn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;, &ldquo;you should read Rushdie&rdquo;) from the moral support your friends give over beers (&ldquo;you can do it&rdquo;, &ldquo;keep going&rdquo;). Get the tough feedback early enough that you can still do something about it.</li><li> <strong>  Only your name is on the book. </strong> Your publisher will publish dozens of books every month. You will publish one book every few years, or maybe just once in your life. They will never care as much as you do about your book. You have the right to veto and argue, politely, with anyone who works on your book. Stand up for yourself, but earn that right by taking writing and publishing seriously. Do your homework. If you don&rsquo;t take shortcuts, no one will try to take shortcuts on you.</li>",

    "content": "<p> Justin Paterno, a manager of the investing website,  <u>  <a href=\"http://stocktwits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   StockTwits  </a> </u> , recently observed that &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zerobeta/the-mobile-investor-of-the-future-dd93d37f4787\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mobile is starting to eat the financial world  </a> </u> .&rdquo; While there seems to be little doubt that mobile is the platform of the future, all this &ldquo;eating&rdquo; seems to be taking place at two different tables.</p><p> Users who fancy white linen table cloths and fine bone china might prefer to dine at the &ldquo;house of Apple.&rdquo; For more budget-conscious diners, Android appears to be the venue of choice.</p><p> Google&rsquo;s Android and Apple&rsquo;s iOS dominate the global mobile operating system market, with a combined  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2888532/idc-android-ios-again-dominate-smartphone-os-market.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   96% market share  </a> </u> . Yet the price differential between iOS iPhones and Android-equiped smartphones, such as those manufactured by Samsung, has increased in recent years. Along the way, Apple&rsquo;s iPhone has solidified its position in the high end of the smartphone market.</p><p> Pew Research Center&rsquo;s study of demographic differences among smartphone users underscores Apple&rsquo;s high-end market dominance. Across income and education categories, there&rsquo;s only  one group  for which the percentage of iPhone users exceeds the percentage of Android users:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/06/05/smartphone-ownership-2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   college-educated individuals, and those whose household income exceeds $75,000  </a> </u> . According to the study,  half  of all cellphone users with a household income above $150,000 say they own an iPhone.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/apple.jpg\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> What does all this say about the type of smartphones used by most Silicon Valley software developers and venture capitalists (VCs)?  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   US News &amp; World Report  </a> </u>  cited a median salary of $93,000 for software developers, with the highest-paid 10 percent earning $144,000. Estimates on  <u>  <a href=\"http://quora.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quora.com  </a> </u>  place the average annual compensation for venture capital associates at about $200,000. So most of the folks who develop, or invest in, mobile Web services are probably iPhone users.</p><p> When one turns to the consumers who make payments on their smartphones, one is likely to encounter a lot more Android owners. iOS-supported Apple and Android-equipped Samsung have been running &ldquo;neck and neck&rdquo; in terms of smartphone market share. With iPhones dominating the high end of the smartphone market, it&rsquo;s not surprising to encounter a lot of Android users below the upper-income stratum of the population.</p><p> Android has emerged as the mobile operating system of the masses. For one example of this, consider  <u>  <a href=\"http://card.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Card.com  </a> </u> , a service that offers prepaid Mastercard and Visa debit cards. At a recent event, hosted by the New York Fintech Startups Meetup,  <u>  <a href=\"http://card.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Card.com  </a> </u> &rsquo;s CFO observed that  90 percent  of that company&rsquo;s mobile signups had been completed on Android devices. Rather than focusing on wealthier individuals,  <u>  <a href=\"http://card.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Card.com  </a> </u>  targets the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lorikozlowski/2013/12/23/card-com-a-startup-making-finance-more-fun-and-fair/\" target=\"_blank\">   90 percent of people out there  </a> </u> &rdquo; with more limited savings.</p><p> The use of bitcoin-payment mobile apps also appears to be a  mass-market , rather than a high-end, consumer phenomenon. Such is the case in the wild world of Las Vegas. The diners and gamblers who use bitcoin are more likely to be found in Sin City&rsquo;s Downtown gambling district &mdash; known for its more moderately-priced casinos and restaurants. In contrast, one would expect to find Silicon Valley VCs and developers hanging out at the Las Vegas Strip&rsquo;s high-end Bellagio and Wynn.</p><p> The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel and Golden Gate Hotel &amp; Casino in Downtown Las Vegas recently began accepting bitcoin. The D casino&rsquo;s manager has observed the most bitcoin spending at the casino&rsquo;s casual eatery. He believes it&rsquo;s the restaurant&rsquo;s &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/las-vegas-casino-ceo-bitcoin-new-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   low pricing that is making bitcoin purchases more common there than at the other restaurants  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> The Las Vegas example is anecdotal. However, it illustrates an interesting contrast between the behavior of iPhone-toting tech  developers  and  financiers , who are creating new mobile-payment apps, and the behavior of Android-connected  consumers , who are using their smartphones to shop and spend.</p>",

    "title": "Personalized Risk Management: Helping Clients Make Smarter Decisions about Their Money",
    "link": "personalized-risk-management-helping-clients-make-smarter-decisions-about-their-money",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In a 2014 survey conducted by CEG Worldwide and the Money Management Institute, affluent clients ranked the top five services they want from a financial advisor. Topping the list at #1 was to help them &ldquo;make smart decisions with their money.&rdquo; </p><p> By shifting financial conversations to help clients focus on purpose and goals, our industry can help clients make more meaningful &ndash; and smarter &ndash; decisions about their money. We believe that utilizing a highly personalized approach to the financial process is key to helping clients focus on outcomes. This personalized approach incorporates three elements: a personalized financial plan, supported by personalized investments and personalized risk management. This process, with an emphasis on personalized risk management, can help clients feel more &ldquo;invested&rdquo; in their financial future. </p><p> In this article, we&rsquo;ll examine why clients can be hard-wired to make irrational decisions about their own money and how advisors can help.</p><h3> <strong>  Bear Market or Grizzly Bear? Same Response &ndash; Run Away! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Ironically, clients would have the same emotional response to a bear market as they would have to an actual bear chasing them in the woods. In either scenario, adrenaline spikes, areas of the brain responsible for rational decision-making are reduced, and the body turns on systems that can help a person run away from danger and preserve their safety.</p><p> The ability to conserve energy from systems that aren&rsquo;t absolutely necessary in favor of contributing energy to systems that can help a person run away from danger made a lot of sense to our ancestors on the plains of the Sahara thousands of years ago. Unfortunately, those same systems can wreak havoc on our decision-making capabilities, and even our health, if they aren&rsquo;t kept in check. </p><h3> <strong>  Clients&rsquo; Brains on Stress: Emotional and Forgetful </strong></h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re all the benefactors, and victims, of the way our brains have evolved. </p><p> The prefrontal cortex and amygdala are two areas of the brain that affect our emotions and decision-making capabilities. The amygdala controls emotions and the prefrontal cortex is responsible for rational thought. Think of it this way: if you&rsquo;re taking the bar exam to become a lawyer, you&rsquo;ll rely on your prefrontal cortex to help drive your reasoning capabilities and to help you arrive at the most likely answers.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re camping and suddenly encounter a bear, the amygdala kicks in sending much-needed hormones to key areas of the body to help you fend off or run away from the predator. At the same time, the brain takes energy from other systems that aren&rsquo;t as necessary &mdash; namely rational thought, memory, and reasoning.</p><h3> <strong>  Does Stress Make You Stupid? </strong></h3><p> <br/> When we&rsquo;re stressed, memory becomes distorted and emotions spike. Electrical signals in the brain associated with the formation of factual memories weaken while areas in the brain associated with emotion strengthen.</p><p> According to behavioral consultant Christy Matta, M.A., &ldquo;Our findings suggest that the growing dominance of amygdalar activity over the hippocampus during and even after chronic stress may contribute to the enhanced emotional symptoms, alongside impaired cognitive function, seen in stress-related psychiatric disorders.&rdquo;</p><p> When a market takes a downward turn or the nightly news evokes a state of hysteria, clients may experience a loss of cognitive function and be tempted to make irrational decisions.</p><h3> <strong>  Using Personalized Risk Management to Help Reduce the Stress of Investing </strong></h3><p> <br/> Just as the markets go up and down, investors&rsquo; appetite for risk goes up and down. Changes in investor behavior are documented by money flows into equities during the late stages of a bull market and out of equities during the late stages of a bear market. In both cases, irrational behavior is driven by fear and greed. </p><p> A personalized risk management approach will adjust and adapt to the changing markets based upon the desired outcome or goal of the client. As investment advisors, it may be time to take a look at the current bull market and talk to clients about taking some risk off the table. Here are some suggestions for using personalized risk management to help ward off clients&rsquo; financial stress: </p><li> Use personal benchmarks to help clients stay focused on their needs, not just market results.</li><li> Focus on the outcomes clients wish to achieve and target investments to those outcomes.</li><li> When appropriate, incorporate downside hedging to protect clients&rsquo; downside risk exposure.</li>",

    "title": "3 Things I Love About e-Verify",
    "link": "3-things-i-love-about-e-verify",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> E-Verify is the internet based system that compares the information from an employee&rsquo;s I-9 to information in the Homeland Security and Social Security Administration databases to confirm the employee is eligible to work legally in the United States.</p><p> Many states require employers to use e-Verify to administer their I-9 compliance programs. There&rsquo;s lots of debate as to whether this should be required nationwide. I&rsquo;m not going to debate that in this post &hellip; I live in NC and it has been required here since October 2012. And, as someone who has survived a couple Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) Audits in their career, I&rsquo;m glad to have e-Verify to help make my I-9 administration more compliant.</p><p> Besides the obvious benefit of ensuring your company is not employing people who aren&rsquo;t authorized to work, here&rsquo;s what else I love about e-Verify:</p><li> <strong>  Limits errors. </strong> Employees and employers complete the I-9 form electronically on the US Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) website or a secondary vendor. The site guides you through each section, making sure everything is filled out completely and correctly to the government standards so there is little room for error. Nothing can be skipped or overlooked because the system will not allow that &hellip; Even after over a decade of completing I-9s, I still get tripped up by the different documents and what info has to be recorded for each document. I love that e-Verify simplifies this for me and reminds me of what needs to be done, when it needs to be done and where.</li><li> <strong>  Keeps records. </strong>  All the I-9s completed thru e-Verify are stored on the USCIS or vendor site for the required duration. If needed, you can access and print it or update it &hellip; Let&rsquo;s face it, storing I-9s is a pain in the butt because they have to be kept separate from other employee records.  I love that e-Verify keeps all this data on file for me so the only thing I have to keep copies of are the List A documents, which don&rsquo;t take up much space because people generally use List B and C documents to prove work eligibility. This saves paper and space which equals to resources I can allocate to other, more value adding areas.</li><li> <strong>  Removes guessing. </strong> The e-Verify site is connected directly to Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration &mdash; the two departments that authorize people to work. Having their approval or denial on the status of your employees&rsquo; work eligibility and the documents they present means the employer doesn&rsquo;t have to use their own judgment on whether the employee is eligible and their documents legitimate &hellip; I&rsquo;m a Human Resources professional. Sometimes I feel like a detective &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t actually want to be one. Examining and scrutinizing documents to be sure they are legitimate is not how I want to spend my time. With e-Verify, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that anymore and I can focus my attention on other things.</li><p> If e-Verify isn&rsquo;t required in your state, I urge you to look into signing up voluntarily to simplify administration and strengthen compliance with I-9 completion. Check out this  <a href=\"http://www.uscis.gov/e-verify/what-e-verify/e-verify-business-friendly\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   link to the USCIS  </u>    </a> website for more information &mdash; and hit me up on  <u>  LinkedIn </u>  for recommendations on which vendors are great and which to avoid partnering with.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Some of the  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/client-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   client advisory boards  </a> </u>  I have facilitated lately, along with an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/client-meetings-go-the-way-of-cassette-players-20418.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article in Financial Advisor  </a> </u>  by Dan Jamieson, have had me thinking about the changing nature of the client review meeting. Client preferences are changing and keeping your clients satisfied and loyal means <strong>  you need to be   <u>   <a href=\"/category/sell/client-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    making some changes   </a>  </u>   along with them </strong> .</p><p> Among the forces driving the evolution of client meetings are:</p><li> The busy lives of clients</li><li> Better access to information</li><li> Changing expectations</li><li> Increasing numbers of clients who retire and move</li><li> And, perhaps most significant, improving technology <br/>  </li><p> When I was a new advisor, financial plans and account statements were all words and numbers &ndash; no graphs. You got statements quarterly and you got a plan update we met. And there was a pretty good chance you had statements coming from three or four places: some from mutual fund families, some from insurance companies, and some from brokerage account custodians. When I met with clients for a review, it was up to me to put the whole picture together for them and let them know what had gone on in their portfolio over the past few months.</p><p> Now clients can get a consolidated view of their portfolio on demand that includes performance statistics, pie charts, and line graphs. On their smart phone. <strong>  They no longer need an advisor to tell them what they have or how it&rsquo;s done. </strong></p><p> The purpose of the meeting has evolved. Clients are less interested in being walked through an economic review. An effective meeting is used to highlight, to discuss, and to decide.</p><p> At one firm&rsquo;s advisory board meeting last year, the clients gave the firm a clear message that they wanted less of the meeting devoted to a review of the portfolio so that more of the time could be spent discussing financial planning issues and answering their planning questions. They deeply value the expertise of the advisor and wanted less presentation and more interaction and strategizing. That same group asked the firm for the reports a week before the meeting to give them an opportunity to review them and formulate questions.</p><p> At another meeting, one participant clarified the point. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t explain to us what happened in every category&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell us what things you see changing, how you think that will affect our portfolio, and what you intend to do if it happens.&rdquo; Many clients have expressed the desire to talk in more depth about the parts of the portfolio that had exceptional or surprising results rather than a comprehensive review. The consistent message appears to be &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me everything, tell me what&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p><p> The frequency and nature of meetings has been another popular topic at advisory board meetings. Some advisors I speak with pride themselves on having a &ldquo;high touch&rdquo; approach that may include in-person client meetings as frequently as quarterly. But the most popular answer we get to the question of how frequently clients would you like to meet their advisor in person is one or two per year.</p><p> Driving down that number is the ability to meet virtually. Whether it be technology that both the advisor and client can log into, like eMoney Advisor or MoneyGuide Pro, screen sharing technology like GoToMeeting, Webex, or Join.me, or simply a web cam and Skype, there is less and less necessity to get together in person. One firm did a demonstration of the eMoney Advisor Decision Center at a meeting last fall and asked its board members if they would like to use the technology for some of their review meetings. One client, president of a large group medical practice, said without hesitation &ldquo;Where do I sign up?&rdquo; The consensus of that board was that a single in person meeting per year would be fine with additional meetings conducted with alternative, remote options. One stipulation was that in person meetings were still necessary when establishing a client relationship.</p><p> So what should you do to respond to this changing environment? Start by asking your clients about their preferences.</p><p> Framing is important. Like most issues in financial advice, getting a meaningful outcome depends mostly on the  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/client-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   quality of the questions  </a> </u> . The most productive path would not be to simply ask your clients &ldquo;would you like to meet remotely?&rdquo; Put together a demonstration of the technology you are considering and lead your advisory board or a group of top clients through a sample meeting. Show them what&rsquo;s possible and ask them their evaluation of it. What would you say were the pros and cons of meeting this way? How does it compare to coming into the office to meet with us? Would you want some of your meetings to be conducted this way?</p><p> Many firms have benefited from engaging their advisory boards in a systematic evaluation of their review meeting process. Step through the standard review meeting agenda and materials. Ask what they find most valuable in those meetings. Ask how they can be improved. What needs to be added? What needs to be dropped? What is the optimal number of meetings per year and how many should be in person, by telephone, or virtual?</p><p> Have you used remote technology to conduct a client review meeting? What has been your experience? How has it changed the way you work with clients or run your practice?</p>",

    "content": "<p> via  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shoppingsmycardio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Shopping's My Cardio  </a> </u>  | Photo Credits: SMCAsk anyone who&rsquo;s been to Hawaii, and they have opinions. Everyone has a favorite island, a favorite beach, a favorite fish taco &ndash; and with good reason. There&rsquo;s just no end of options and opportunities to make Hawaii your own &ndash; that&rsquo;s the magic of it. But whether you&rsquo;re a resort rat sticking close to the bar at the pool (ahem) or prefer to rent a condo and explore on your own, you&rsquo;ll need a list to get you started.For me, the favorite island vote goes to Maui, hands down. It&rsquo;s more mellow than Oahu, but with more food and shopping options than Kauai. And the people are simply amazing &ndash; a living exercise in zen if ever there was one. On Maui, you don&rsquo;t see locals walking around with their heads buried in their phones. In fact, call a local&rsquo;s cell and you&rsquo;re almost guaranteed not to get an answer. It all takes some getting used to &ndash; this focus on looking ahead instead of down, of interacting instead of ignoring. But once you sink in, it makes your vacation into something you can&rsquo;t find anywhere else.Not long ago, the hubs and I embarked on&hellip;oh, this must be our fourth trip to Maui now. And though some of the novelty has worn off, it&rsquo;s been replaced with a comfortable familiarity, like visiting an old friend. Though new discoveries have become old haunts, there&rsquo;s always something new to uncover on Maui. And I&rsquo;m nothing if not an exhaustive researcher. So I ate, shopped and lounged my way through the island to find the cream of the crop. For you, my friends. It&rsquo;s a dirty job. Whether you have Maui on your agenda or just on your bucket list, get ready for some serious wanderlust.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SMC-eat-in-maui.jpg\" width=\"730\"/>To Eat. I&rsquo;ll admit, I&rsquo;m a foodie first &ndash; especially when I travel. Maui offers up so, so many delicious things to nosh on, and you&rsquo;re already wearing stretchy pants.<li> For casual fare, my favorites are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.starnoodle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Star Noodle  </a> </u>  (owned by a Top Chef contender),  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.leodas.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leoda&rsquo;s Kitchen &amp; Pie Shop  </a> </u>  (two words: banana cream), and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.honumaui.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Honu  </a> </u>  (a little pricey, but beachfront and with a great laidback vibe you&rsquo;ll welcome after being at a fancy resort).</li><li> The best sushi on the island? Any local will tell you it&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"/category/wow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sansei  </a> </u> , hands-down. And truthfully, I look forward to my dinner there every time I visit. It&rsquo;s pretty casual, and the prices are remarkably reasonable (especially if you&rsquo;re a night owl, since everything&rsquo;s half off after 10 pm Thurs-Sat). The fish is fresher than you&rsquo;ve ever had, and everything is outstanding. I typically stick with the sushi, but their miso-glazed butterfish is some of the best around.</li><li> For high-end dining, the Fairmont Kea Lani&rsquo;s newly-remodeled  <u>  <a href=\"http://korestaurant.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ko  </a> </u>  is still an absolute delight. The menu is inspired by all of the many cultures on the island, instead of just being generic Asian fusion like so many other high-end spots on Maui. Service, food and ambiance were impeccable. But I found a new love in the Hyatt&rsquo;s brand new  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hyatt.com/content/dam/hotel/propertysites/assets/regency/oggrm/documents/en_us/dining/japengo/Japengo-DinnerMenu.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Japengo  </a> </u> , an Asian fusion menu so good, it has singlehandedly ruined me for &ldquo;mainland&rdquo; fusion fare. I over-ordered like a good little reviewer, so I can confidently tell you that just about everything on the menu is ridiculously good, including their sushi. (But I can tell you that if you don&rsquo;t try the Japengo Fried Rice or the Duck Meatballs, we just can&rsquo;t be friends.)</li><li> Speaking of the Hyatt, even if you do nothing else I suggest, please have brunch at their  <u>  <a href=\"http://maui.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels-maui/entertainment/dining_detail.jsp?itemDesc=fboutlet&amp;itemId=1003066\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Swan Court  </a> </u> . No matter how many times I go, every time I walk down that staircase and catch my first glimpse of their open-air dining room set on a private little pond with &ndash; yes &ndash; swans swimming around while you eat (along with flamingoes and all manner of other feathered friends), I fall in love all over again. The buffet&rsquo;s great, but truly, it&rsquo;s the vibe you&rsquo;re after. Take a book, prepare to let them refill your coffee cup all morning long and just relax into the picture-perfect setting. It&rsquo;s the quintessential Hawaii experience.</li><img alt=\"\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-SMC-where-to-stay-in-maui.jpg\" width=\"730\"/>To Stay. For me, Maui is all about the resorts. Plant me in a beach chair, bring me a pina colada, and I&rsquo;ll see you in a week. So, the more lovely the pool and the more attentive the service, the happier I&rsquo;ll be. My top three resorts:<li> <u>  <a href=\"http://maui.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels-maui/;jsessionid=0DEB33EE1B811579F6719DCDF1669F5B.atg01-prd-atg1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hyatt Maui  </a> </u>  (Ka&rsquo;anapali): In case my restaurant recs didn&rsquo;t give it away, the Hyatt Maui is easily one of my favorite spots on the island. The rooms could maybe do with a little update, but the ambiance at the resort is just completely unrivaled by anything else &ndash; not so fancy that you&rsquo;ll feel out of place, but luxurious enough to feel like you&rsquo;ve treated yourself. They also have this incredible menagerie of exotic birds everywhere (penguins too!), a soaring open-air courtyard, oceanfront hammocks, swim-up bar&hellip;I just love it. If you can, book a package that includes daily breakfast at the Swan Court.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fairmont.com/kea-lani-maui/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fairmont Kea Lani  </a> </u>  (Wailea). The Fairmont is everything you want in a luxury resort. Every room is a suite, and a gorgeous one at that (for an upgrade, feel free to rent a villa, where they&rsquo;ll even send a chef to cook you dinner). The pools are divine, particularly the adult-only pool, and the view was spectacular. Service is amazing throughout the resort, and they&rsquo;ll bring you fresh pineapple while you sunbathe.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/KapaluaMaui/Default.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ritz-Carlton Kapalua Bay  </a> </u> . Kapalua is about 15 minutes north of Lahaina, so it feels like a real escape, but you&rsquo;re still close to town. The Ritz property there was built up on a cliff, so it&rsquo;s a downhill stroll to head to the beach, but if you&rsquo;re only in it for the views (as I am), you won&rsquo;t mind a bit. Service at the Ritz blew my mind &ndash; every last person we dealt was above and beyond. The rooms nailed that &ldquo;upscale island&rdquo; vibe, which is really tricky to do, and the spa&hellip;well, if I&rsquo;d known how amazing it was, I&rsquo;d have spent the entire day there. Bonus: You can get surprisingly good rates at the resort if you do a bit of research.</li><img alt=\"\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3-SMC-where-to-shop-in-maui.jpg\" width=\"730\"/>To Buy. Oh, if I must find something not to love about Maui, it&rsquo;s the shopping. You can only go into so many ABC stores and see the same collection of plastic clip-on plumerias and shell necklaces before you give up and head back to the pool (as you should). But there are a few gems.<li> I love the kitsch factor at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sirwilfreds.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sir Wilfred&rsquo;s  </a> </u> , and their coffee is better than anyone&rsquo;s, whether you&rsquo;re looking for Kona or something less island-y. (Buy some  <u>  Maui Upcountry guava butter </u>  while you&rsquo;re there. It&rsquo;ll change your life.)</li><li> I also loved  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.villagegalleriesmaui.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Village Galleries  </a> </u>  in Lahaina, an art gallery and a gift shop featuring some really beautiful pieces from actual Maui artisans (unlike the cheap, Made in China fare you&rsquo;ll find at most tourist traps).</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mauihands.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Maui Hands  </a> </u> , inside the Hyatt, has some gems as well &ndash; I fell hard for the art by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lindawhittemore.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Linda Whittemore  </a> </u>  and jewelry by  <u>  Pratima Design </u> .</li><li> If traditional Hawaiian quilts are your thing, the only place you want to go to check them out is  <u>  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112031713705832174949/about?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   Quilts n&rsquo; Fabric Land  </a> </u>  in Lahaina. No website, and the owner is a little bristly at first, but convince her you&rsquo;re a connoisseur and she&rsquo;ll soften right up. They have a beautiful selection of quilts, or you can custom order your favorite. They also stock all manner of smaller quilted souvenirs, perfect for toting home to Mom.</li><li> If (and only if!) you&rsquo;re already headed that way, the gift shop at the  <u>  Bailey House Museum </u>  in Wailuku is a gem of a place, but it&rsquo;s so out of the way of anything else, I&rsquo;d hesitate to recommend it. Once we were there, though, we ended up finding nearly all of our souvenirs for friends, and a few things for ourselves.</li><img alt=\"\" height=\"143\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-SMC-whale.jpg\" width=\"730\"/>To Do. Honestly, I&rsquo;m a complete laze-ball when I&rsquo;m Maui-bound. But there are a few things most definitely worth doing:<li> The whale-watching tour was maybe my all-time favorite Maui experience. I did much too much research on this, and landed on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sailingmaui.com/Hula_Girl/whale-watch.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hula Girl  </a> </u> . They have a kitchen onboard, and the food was actually quite good. Some cruises include an open bar in the price, but Hula Girl did not, which I actually preferred &ndash; 40 drunk people on a boat is not my idea of a good time. Hula Girl felt more upscale, and the crowd was more my speed. That said, all of the tours I considered all ended up within 500 feet of each other once we were out to sea, watching the exact same whales (we saw whales!) at the exact same time. So, don&rsquo;t stress too much.</li><li> If you&rsquo;re at all interested in astronomy, the view of the night sky in Maui is tough to beat. Head to the Hyatt after dark and check out their rooftop  <u>  <a href=\"http://maui.hyatt.com/en/hotel/activities/hotel-activities/tourofthestars.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tour of the Stars  </a> </u>  &ndash; the views from their NASA-grade collection of telescopes are just incredible, and you&rsquo;ll definitely learn a thing or three from their crazy smart Director of Astronomy (who knew that was a job?).</li><li> Go for a drive. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter where&hellip;you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a bad view in Maui. I tend to hit Highway 30 and head north until my jaw starts dropping from the incredible coastal views at every turnout. People will tell you to try the Road to Hana, and I have no doubt it&rsquo;s gorgeous&hellip;but I stick closer to home (which also makes it that much easier to get back to the pool in time for lunch).</li>And that, in a nutshell, is everything I know about Maui &ndash; unless you need to know <u> <a href=\"http://www.shoppingsmycardio.com/2013/01/15/the-how-to-pack-for-a-tropical-vacation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  how to pack for that tropical escape </a></u>, which I happen to have down to a science.",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There&rsquo;s a great <u>  scene </u> in the movie Avalon where the young protagonist Michael (played by Elijah Wood) is in a classroom being taught the grammatical difference between the words &ldquo;can&rdquo; and &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</p><p> Teacher: &ldquo;&rsquo;Can&rsquo; is whether you&rsquo;re capable of doing something. &lsquo;May&rsquo; is asking for permission.&rdquo; <br/> Michael: raises his hand <br/> Teacher: &ldquo;Yes Michael?&rdquo; <br/> Michael: &ldquo;Can I go to the bathroom?&rdquo; <br/> Teacher: &ldquo;Michael, do you want to repeat that question?&rdquo; <br/> Michael: (under his breath) &ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;m going to be made an example of.&rdquo; <br/> Teacher: &ldquo;Michael!&rdquo; <br/> Michael: &ldquo;I said, can I go to the bathroom?&rdquo; <br/> Teacher: &ldquo;You CAN but you MAY not.&rdquo; <br/> Michael: &ldquo;Well, can I or can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; <br/> Teacher: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to this lesson, have you Michael Kay?&rdquo; <br/> Michael: &ldquo;Well&hellip;yes I have.&rdquo; <br/> Teacher: &ldquo;So how would you REPHRASE the question?&rdquo; <br/> Michael: &ldquo;Can I PLEASE go to the bathroom?&rdquo; <br/> Teacher: &ldquo;Michael Kay, why don&rsquo;t you just spend some time in the hallway until you&rsquo;ve learned the difference between &lsquo;Can&rsquo; and &lsquo;May.&rsquo;</p><p> Isn&rsquo;t that how we all feel some time? We&rsquo;re asking for permission to do something we consider completely ordinary, something in the best interests of all concerned. But because we didn&rsquo;t ask in the right way or because the powers that be don&rsquo;t understand the feet on the ground simplicity and beneficence of our request, we&rsquo;re asked to spend some time in the hallway contemplating our navels so to speak.</p><p> Much of our corporate creative innovative experience is echoed in this scene. Sometimes, we know how to innovate, we&rsquo;re capable of innovating, we&rsquo;re excited about innovating, we desperately want to innovate. But there are paradigms in place. Paradigms about how things are done, paradigms about &lsquo;correct&rsquo; behavior, paradigms about creativity, paradigms about what&rsquo;s valuable, paradigms about what&rsquo;s worthwhile. Essentially, paradigms about whether you &lsquo;may&rsquo; innovate.</p><p> Many people in leadership are so embedded in these paradigms that being allowed to innovate becomes first a challenge of whether you asked correctly or whether you can immediately prove the short term ROI or whether the internal political advantages are satisfied.</p><p> It really breaks down like this:</p><li> You can not and you may not. In many companies, this is very often the case. The company just doesn&rsquo;t have the creative skills to innovate because they&rsquo;ve hired traditional people with traditional skills doing traditional tasks in traditional ways. And, they don&rsquo;t recognize the need to innovate. They really just believe that &lsquo;work more, work harder, work faster, work smarter&rsquo; will grow the company. They often give verbal validation to innovation but their real understanding of the discipline of innovation is limited or non-existent. In this case, innovation typically only occurs by happenstance.</li><li> You can not but you may. In this scenario the company does recognize the value of innovation but they&rsquo;ve failed to incorporate creativity and innovation into their culture. Leadership evangelizes the benefits of innovation but hasn&rsquo;t hired for that skillset or hasn&rsquo;t promoted its true value or hasn&rsquo;t opened a path for it to succeed. Additionally it&rsquo;s often true that the people in the company don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;get&rdquo; innovation or, equally crippling, they&rsquo;re not passionate about it (innovation requires passion!). Leadership has given them permission, even a mandate, but either they don&rsquo;t know how or they don&rsquo;t want to.</li><li> You can but you may not. This is the most common situation. Most people with any intellectual temerity naturally have the desire to innovate. They really do. And many people have the skill, the drive, the passion. But &lsquo;corporate&rsquo;, &lsquo;the business&rsquo;, doesn&rsquo;t understand or comprehend the value proposition inherent in innovation. Unbeknownst to them, they may be following a practice of &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://technologycreated.com/2012/11/21/how-not-to-innovate/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not innovating  </a> </u> .&rdquo; In this case, you are often told to &ldquo;spend some time in the hallway until you&rsquo;ve learned the difference between &lsquo;Can&rsquo; and &lsquo;May.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li><li> You can and you may. Hooray! You know innovation. You&rsquo;re creative and you understand the risks involved. And the rewards. And you&rsquo;re passionate about it! You&rsquo;re ready to approach new solutions with non-traditional methods, and&hellip; hooray! The powers that be are eager for you to jump in with both feet. And they mean it, they back you up, they encourage risk-taking and they demonstrate commitment to innovation. They reward excellent failures because they believe in you and your ability to learn from failures and apply lessons to new and exciting projects that generate successes. <br/>  </li><p> Actually, there&rsquo;s one more possibility.</p><p> You can and you must. Leadership not only supports innovation, they expect it, in fact, they demand it. This is the best scenario because there&rsquo;s a recognition of the value of innovation. Not only do you have permission, you have a mandate. You have time, you have a budget, and the conversation comes naturally. Yes, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s routinely so. It&rsquo;s expected. In this case, it&rsquo;s also a must that leadership understands innovation and is committed to it.</p><p> The challenge with developing an innovation culture is getting your team to &lsquo;can&rsquo; and your leadership to &lsquo;may.&rsquo; If you hire for &lsquo;can&rsquo; and inspire for &lsquo;may&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re well on the way to making innovation part of the everyday culture of your organization.</p>",

Are we seeing a Nokia change? </strong>Will banks miss the tipping point and die from the reformation of the internet, or will we respond and change in time?We all know the Kodak and Nokia stories of moving from Hero to Zero (for those that don&rsquo;t, the stories are repeated in depth at the end of this blog with Kodak first and then Nokia).So here are a few things we know:<li> <strong>  We have seen other industries decimated by digital &ndash; books, music, photography &ndash; and know that the same is happening to banking </strong></li><li> <strong>  We know that the greatest asset to a bank is data but banks do not leverage their data assets: according to Forrester, only 3% of data is tagged and less than 0.5% analysed </strong></li><li> <strong>  We know that banks are structured inefficiently in product silos that lack customer focus </strong></li><li> <strong>  We know that we have legacy systems that are inefficient and need refreshment </strong></li><li> <strong>  We know that cryptocurrencies are redefining the digitisation of money and currency </strong></li><li> <strong>  We know that 1,000&rsquo;s of companies are launching new innovative models of managing money and value </strong></li><li> <strong>  We know that billions of dollars is being ploughed into these new companies to force change in the banking system </strong></li><strong> We know we have to change.</strong>OK, so we know a lot and it is clear that this could be a Kodak or Nokia moment.  Kodak invented the digital camera but thought film was still the future.  How wrong were they?  Nokia owned the mobile market but let Apple turn it into a cheap computer and steal their business.  Why didn&rsquo;t Nokia do something sooner?  And banks are possibly going through the same.  Or are they?I qualify the change in banking, as most people talk about banking as a protected industry unlike any other.  The regulatory, compliance, audit and governance requirements, combined with capital reserves that are massively onerous, mean that few can get into the banking game.This has certainly proven true over the past 25 years.  During the past quarter century, everyone forecast that banks were dead and would be disintermediated.  Hasn&rsquo;t happened.  It&rsquo;s why there are only a few big banks in most countries, and little competition.However, bearing in mind the list of challenges we face above, is that a good reason to sit back and be complacent today?  And what about all of these new fintech start-ups, will they change the business?Most bankers are talk to today say yes.  Or at least most bankers who understand the fintech change in our world, of which there are some.  These bankers believe that cryptocurrencies are designed to wipe out the banks middle office processing structures; that P2P wipes out their credit product offers and more; and that the front-end relationship is being taken over by Apple Pay.  These bankers believe Apple Pay will wipe out Visa and MasterCard over the next decade; that Bitcoin will replace SWIFT; and that they have to enable peer-to-peer connectivity for value exchange rather than act as the control freaks the banks have been for the past quarter century.The trouble is that most of the bankers are not sitting in a decision making capacity.  They are executors and implementers of digital strategies, and struggle to get their voices heard in the upper echelons of management.The decision making executive team is more usually comprised of diligent banking people who have spent years dealing with regulations and compliance.  They are the ones who believe that is the barrier to entry, and that they only need to change due to regulatory or competitive forces.  They see digital as channel to market, and crypocurrencies as a game.  They have little interest in listening to the digital crowd who, more often than not, are seen as geeks and nerds in the banking cellars.More on this tomorrow, but the question is: who is right? <strong> Are the digital bankers screaming and shouting that we are going through a banking Kodak moment; or are their senior management right in saying we only need to change at the speed of the fastest competitor?</strong>I know who my vote goes with, but then I&rsquo;m sitting in the cellar of a bank right now as I write this &hellip;<strong> How Kodak Failed from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2012/01/18/how-kodak-failed/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u>  January 2012, written by Chunka Mui, coauthor of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Killer-Apps-Companies-Out-Innovate/dp/0989242013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The New Killer Apps: How Large Companies Can Out-Innovate Start-Ups  </a> </u></strong>There are few corporate blunders as staggering as Kodak&rsquo;s missed opportunities in digital photography, a technology that it invented. This strategic failure was the direct cause of Kodak&rsquo;s decades-long decline as digital photography destroyed its film-based business model.A new book by Vince Barabba, a former Kodak executive, offers insight on the choices that set Kodak on the path to bankruptcy.  Barabba&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;The Decision Loom: A Design for Interactive Decision-Making in Organizations,&rdquo; also offers sage advice for how other organizations grappling with disruptive technologies might avoid their own Kodak moments.Steve Sasson, the Kodak engineer who invented the first digital camera in 1975, characterized the initial corporate response to his invention this way: But it was filmless photography, so management&rsquo;s reaction was, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s cute&mdash;but don&rsquo;t tell anyone about it.&rsquo;Kodak management&rsquo;s inability to see digital photography as a disruptive technology, even as its researchers extended the boundaries of the technology, would continue for decades. As late as 2007, a Kodak marketing video felt the need to trumpet that &ldquo;Kodak is back &ldquo; and that Kodak &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t going to play grab ass anymore&rdquo; with digital.To understand how Kodak could stay in denial for so long, let me go back to a story that Vince Barabba recounts from 1981, when he was Kodak&rsquo;s head of market intelligence. Around the time that Sony SNE +1.13% introduced the first electronic camera, one of Kodak&rsquo;s largest retailer photo finishers asked him whether they should be concerned about digital photography. With the support of Kodak&rsquo;s CEO, Barabba conducted a very extensive research effort that looked at the core technologies and likely adoption curves around silver halide film versus digital photography.The results of the study produced both &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and &ldquo;good&rdquo; news. The &ldquo;bad&rdquo; news was that digital photography had the potential capability to replace Kodak&rsquo;s established film based business. The &ldquo;good&rdquo; news was that it would take some time for that to occur and that Kodak had roughly ten years to prepare for the transition.The study&rsquo;s projections were based on numerous factors, including: the cost of digital photography equipment; the quality of images and prints; and the interoperability of various components, such as cameras, displays, and printers. All pointed to the conclusion that adoption of digital photography would be minimal and non-threatening for a time. History proved the study&rsquo;s conclusions to be remarkably accurate, both in the short and long term.The problem is that, during its 10-year window of opportunity, Kodak did little to prepare for the later disruption. In fact, Kodak made exactly the mistake that George Eastman, its founder, avoided twice before, when he gave up a profitable dry-plate business to move to film and when he invested in color film even though it was demonstrably inferior to black and white film (which Kodak dominated).Barabba left Kodak in 1985 but remained close to its senior management. Thus he got a close look at the fact that, rather than prepare for the time when digital photography would replace film, as Eastman had with prior disruptive technologies, Kodak choose to use digital to improve the quality of film.This strategy continued even though, in 1986, Kodak&rsquo;s research labs developed the first mega-pixel camera, one of the milestones that Barabba&rsquo;s study had forecasted as a tipping point in terms of the viability of standalone digital photography.The choice to use digital as a prop for the film business culminated in the 1996 introduction of the Advantix Preview film and camera system, which Kodak spent more than $500M to develop and launch. One of the key features of the Advantix system was that it allowed users to preview their shots and indicate how many prints they wanted. The Advantix Preview could do that because it was a digital camera. Yet it still used film and emphasized print because Kodak was in the photo film, chemical and paper business. Advantix flopped. Why buy a digital camera and still pay for film and prints? Kodak wrote off almost the entire cost of development.As Paul Carroll and I describe in &ldquo;Billion-Dollar Lessons: What You Can Learn From The Most Inexcusable Business Failures of the Last 25 Years,&rdquo; Kodak also suffered several other significant, self-inflicted wounds in those pivotal years:In 1988, Kodak bought Sterling Drug for $5.1B, deciding that it was really a chemical business, with a part of that business being a photography company. Kodak soon learned that chemically treated photo paper isn&rsquo;t really all that similar to hormonal agents and cardiovascular drugs, and it sold Sterling in pieces, for about half of the original purchase price.In 1989, the Kodak board of directors had a chance to take make a course change when Colby Chandler, the CEO, retired. The choices came down to Phil Samper and Kay R. Whitmore. Whitmore represented the traditional film business, where he had moved up the rank for three decades. Samper had a deep appreciation for digital technology. The board chose Whitmore. As the New York Times reported at the time: Mr. Whitmore said he would make sure Kodak stayed closer to its core businesses in film and photographic chemicals.Samper resigned and would demonstrate his grasp of the digital world in later roles as president of Sun Microsystems and then CEO of Cray Research. Whitmore lasted a little more than three years, before the board fired him in 1993.For more than another decade, a series of new Kodak CEOs would bemoan his predecessor&rsquo;s failure to transform the organization to digital, declare his own intention to do so, and proceed to fail at the transition, as well. George Fisher, who was lured from his position as CEO of Motorola to succeed Whitmore in 1993, captured the core issue when he told the New York Times that Kodak &ldquo;regarded digital photography as the enemy, an evil juggernaut that would kill the chemical-based film and paper business that fueled Kodak&rsquo;s sales and profits for decades&rdquo;.Fisher oversaw the flop of Advantix and was gone by 1999. As the 2007 Kodak video acknowledges, the story did not change for another decade. Kodak now has a market value of $140m and teeters on bankruptcy. Its prospects seem reduced to suing  and others for infringing on patents that it was never able to turn into winning products.Addressing strategic decision-making quandaries such as those faced by Kodak is one of the prime questions addressed in Vince Barabba&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://amzn.to/sFudff\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Decision Loom </a></u>.&rdquo; Kodak management not only presided over the creation technological breakthroughs but was also presented with an accurate market assessment about the risks and opportunities of such capabilities. Yet Kodak failed in making the right strategic choices.This isn&rsquo;t an academic question for Vince Barabba but rather the culmination of his life&rsquo;s work. He has spent much of his career delivering market intelligence to senior management. In addition to his experiences at Kodak, his career includes being director of the U.S. Census Bureau (twice), head of market research at Xerox, head of strategy at General Motors (during some of its best recent years), and inclusion in the market research hall of fame.&ldquo;<u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Decision-Loom-Interactive-Decision-Making-Organizations/dp/1908009446\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Decision Loom </a></u>&rdquo; explores how to ensure that management uses market intelligence properly. The book encapsulates Barabba&rsquo;s prescription of how senior management might turn all the data, information and knowledge that market researchers deliver to them into the wisdom to make the right decisions. It is a prescription well worth considering.Barabba argues that four interrelated capabilities are necessary to enable effective enterprise-wide decision-making&mdash;none of which were particularly well-represented during pivotal decisions at Kodak:<strong> 1.  Having an enterprise mindset that is open to change.</strong> Unless those at the top are sufficiently open and willing to consider all options, the decision-making process soon gets distorted. Unlike its founder, George Eastman, who twice adopted disruptive photographic technology, Kodak&rsquo;s management in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s were unwilling to consider digital as a replacement for film. This limited them to a fundamentally flawed path.<strong> 2. Thinking and acting holistically. </strong>Separating out and then optimizing different functions usually reduces the effectiveness of the whole. In Kodak&rsquo;s case, management did a reasonable job of understanding how the parts of the enterprise (including its photo finishing partners) interacted within the framework of the existing technology. There was, however, little appreciation for the effort being conducted in the Kodak Research Labs with digital technology.<strong> 3. Being able to adapt the business design to changing conditions. </strong>Barabba offers three different business designs along a mechanistic to organismic continuum&mdash;make-and-sell, sense-and-respond and anticipate-and-lead. The right design depends on the predictability of the market. Kodak&rsquo;s unwillingness to change its large and highly efficient ability to make-and-sell film in the face of developing digital technologies lost it the chance to adopt an anticipate-and-lead design that could have secured the it a leading position in digital image processing.<strong> 4. Making decisions interactively using a variety of methods.</strong>This refers to the ability to incorporate a range of sophisticated decision support tools when tackling complex business problems. Kodak had a very effect decision support process in place but failed to use that information effectively.While &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Decision-Loom-Interactive-Decision-Making-Organizations/dp/1908009446\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> The Decision Loom</a>&rdquo; goes a long way to explaining Kodak&rsquo;s slow reaction to digital photography, its real value is as a guidepost for today&rsquo;s managers dealing with ever-more disruptive changes. Given that there are few industries not grappling with disruptive change, it is a valuable book for any senior (or aspiring) manager to read.&mdash;&mdash;Chunka Mui is the coauthor of <u> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/New-Killer-Apps-Companies-Out-Innovate/dp/0989242013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The New Killer Apps: How Large Companies Can Out-Innovate Start-Ups </a></u>.

The Finnish company had the widest choice, the best designs, and the most respected brand around the world, so it was pretty hard to pick a bad phone from its catalog. Try doing the same thing today, however, and you&rsquo;ll find every link on the Nokia homepage <u> <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6513979/nokia-com-moves-to-microsoft-mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  pointing to Microsoft&rsquo;s Mobile Devices division </a></u> &mdash; the new incarnation of the Nokia most of us knew and loved. It&rsquo;s a vastly different mobile world we&rsquo;re living in now, but what&rsquo;s most striking about it is that Nokia saw it all coming.The <u> <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6154975/iphone-6-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  best phone in the world today </a></u> is dressed from head to toe in aluminum and has an outstanding camera that protrudes from its body. So did the <u> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/14/nokia-n8-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nokia N8 </a></u> in 2010. The iPhone that&rsquo;s collecting all the plaudits and sales now is basically the fulfilment of a vision Nokia had half a decade ago: combine the best camera with the best build materials and let others try to match you. The only thing Nokia didn&rsquo;t do right with that phone was its software. The N8 design was ready to go in early 2010, when it would have been among the first with 720p video recording, but repeated delays of the new Symbian version pushed its release to September. The hardware was getting kneecapped by the software, which a Nokia employee told me at the time was being developed in separate silos that wouldn&rsquo;t be integrated into a single operating system until the final weeks before launch.\"It's big!\" He says with a smile. \"But it's also beautiful and very thin this time.\"No, those aren&rsquo;t the words of Apple&rsquo;s Phil Schiller describing the iPhone 6 Plus; they are the proclamations of Anssi Vanjoki while presenting the Nokia E7 at <u> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/14/live-from-nokia-world-2010/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nokia World 2010 </a></u>. The E7&rsquo;s 4-inch screen was considered large for its time, but Nokia knew where our preferences were heading. Watch the rest of its presentation from that September 2010 gathering and you&rsquo;ll also hear of personalized location-based services not unlike Google Now. \"And it is a space that we intend to own,\" said Executive VP Niklas Savander at the time. As wildly optimistic as that may sound in hindsight, it was a justifiable ambition for a company that was the leader in mobile mapping and navigation services, even if its software left something to be desired.<strong> NOKIA&rsquo;S BIGGEST FAILURE WAS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO EMBRACE DRASTIC CHANGE</strong>Nokia&rsquo;s biggest failure was an unwillingness to embrace drastic change. The company sowed the seeds for its self-destruction when it made \"the familiarity of the new\" the tagline for its big Symbian upgrade those many years ago. It feared alienating current users by changing too much, so it ended up with a compromised mess of an operating system that wasn&rsquo;t fit for the future. Even as it was making one mistake, however, Nokia was keenly aware of the threat of another.Jumping to Android was widely advocated as a quick shortcut to making Nokia&rsquo;s software competitive, but Anssi Vanjoki dismissed that idea as <u> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/21/ce-oh-no-he-didnt-anssi-vanjoki-says-using-android-is-like-pe/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a short-term solution </a></u> that was no better than \"peeing in your pants for warmth in the winter.\" I was among those who thought him wrong, but the recent financial struggles of HTC, Motorola, and Sony have shown him to be more prophetic than paranoid. Nobody outside of Google, Samsung, and Microsoft (by virtue of patent royalty payments) is making real money off the sales of Android phones.<strong> THE NOKIA N9 WAS A REVELATION, BUT MEEGO WAS NEVER GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE</strong>Eventually, Nokia&rsquo;s hand was forced into making a switch and it chose Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Phone as <u> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/08/nokia-ceo-stephen-elop-rallies-troops-in-brutally-honest-burnin/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the platform to build its future on </a></u>. That construction project is still going on, though it no longer carries the Nokia name. Before Windows Phone, we got a glimpse of what might have been with the introduction of the Nokia N9. It ran the open-source MeeGo OS that Nokia was developing as a successor to Symbian, and it infused a breath of fresh air into both hardware and software design for phones.The N9&rsquo;s unibody was so desirable to look at and delightful to the touch that it spawned a family of Windows Phone progeny that continues today with the <u> <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6103443/lumia-730-selfie-phone-launch-ifa-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Lumia 730 </a></u>. The multitasking overview and switcher of the N9 has also been widely emulated in devices of all creeds and operating systems, and so has its double-tap-to-wake functionality. That phone was, and remains, a revelation. Still, MeeGo development wasn&rsquo;t proceeding as quickly as new Nokia boss Stephen Elop had wished, and there was no app ecosystem to speak of, so the N9 and its kind were banished in favor of the more pragmatic Microsoft-led approach.Nokia's 2007 vision of the future was remarkably similar to Apple's.The list of things Nokia saw coming but failed to adapt to is regrettably long. Another instance where Anssi Vanjoki seemed to exaggerate was when he predicted that <u> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/21/ce-oh-no-he-didnt-nokias-anssi-vanjoki-thinks-cameraphones-a/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  DSLRs would be replaced by cameraphones </a></u>. I mocked his outlandish claim then, but to look at the new iPhones, the Panasonic CM1, and Nokia&rsquo;s own Lumia 1020, there are now certainly enough excellent options to make at least a few people drop the bulky dedicated camera. Nokia is, of course, not unique in its anticipation of future trends, but it has been better at it than its epic fall from dominance would suggest. Like Palm with webOS, Intel with Mobile Internet Devices, and even Xerox with the graphical user interface, Nokia has repeatedly demonstrated that being first to a good idea is no guarantee of commercial success.<strong> BEING FIRST IS NO GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS</strong>Before the iPhone had apps and Android got Maps, Nokia phones had both. Today there isn&rsquo;t a flagship smartphone without either a metal or faux metal finish. If only Nokia&rsquo;s software were as good as its foresight and hardware, my visits to its homepage would still be producing the same frisson of excitement that they once did. Instead, I&rsquo;m left staring vacantly at the four squares of the Nokia apocalypse that join up to form the Microsoft logo.",

How's the water?\" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, \"What the hell is water?\" <br/> <br/> David Foster Wallace's interpretation of this story is: the most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are the hardest to see and talk about. <br/> <br/> While I don't disagree with that, my interpretation is: we have forgotten about the water because it's what we \"live\" or \"live in\" every day.

It's ridiculous. It should be what every company lives and breathes every day. There should be no concerns over executive buy-in or battles to build a business case and prove return on investment.

Here's to hoping that that's not too far off for your company. <br/> <br/> When you&rsquo;re trying to make an important decision, and you&rsquo;re sort of divided on the issue, ask yourself: If the customer were here, what would she say? -Dharmesh Shah</p>",

    "content": "<p> Newsletters will always be fashionable in our books. They&rsquo;re simply one of the best ways to get the right content in front of the right people. If you&rsquo;re interested in finding ways to improve your newsletters, check out this post.</p><p> Here are 11 quick reminders to make sure your newsletters are as engaging as possible:</p><p> <strong>  1. Write great headlines </strong></p><p> Today, everyone&rsquo;s attention is being pulled in different directions. A strong headline is probably the best way to grab a reader&rsquo;s attention. Try writing out 25 different headlines before you make a final decision.</p><p> <strong>  2. Focus your content </strong></p><p> A newsletter filled with scattered content themes may feel sloppy. We think staying focused on one overarching topic per newsletter is often the best way to do it.</p><p> <strong>  3. Think carefully about your images </strong></p><p> Stock photos may be okay, given that they can add some flavour to a newsletter. But a bold image &ndash; one that inspires, challenges or intrigues &ndash; can take a newsletter to the next level.</p><p> <strong>  4. Write timely content </strong></p><p> The most popular newsletters have articles that tackle a current event. Although current content often means tighter deadlines, we think it&rsquo;s worth it.</p><p> <strong>  5. Build a strong list </strong></p><p> Your email (or mailing) list doesn&rsquo;t have to be big. Just get the right info in front of the right people.</p><p> <strong>  6. Don&rsquo;t stop researching </strong></p><p> More data at hand means that when clients ask for more information, you can keep the conversation going and continue to add value.</p><p> <strong>  7. Test your content </strong></p><p> Send out different versions of your newsletter. For example, use different headlines, calls to action and images, and see which ones get more responses. Of course, your results will be more meaningful if you have a larger list but it can&rsquo;t hurt to experiment!</p><p> <strong>  8. Share it </strong></p><p> Social media is one of the best ways to get your newsletters in front of new eyes. Get on LinkedIn and Twitter to share the content that you worked hard to produce.</p><p> <strong>  9. Create a clear unsubscribe link </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re sending your newsletter via email, make sure you have a clear unsubscribe link. Now that CASL has come to Canada, big ($1 million+) fines are in store for people and companies who are found guilty of spamming. So make sure it&rsquo;s incredibly easy for readers to get off your list.</p><p> <strong>  10. Think about less content </strong></p><p> Your newsletter, like all content initiatives, must be sustainable. If it&rsquo;s taking up too much time, send less copy rather than skipping an edition.</p><p> <strong>  11. Seek feedback </strong></p><p> Ask what your readers thought about your newsletter in every edition you send out. The feedback you receive is a key resource for crafting future content.</p>",

    "title": "Does a Diversification Strategy Fit with a Planner's Fiduciary Duty?",
    "link": "does-a-diversification-strategy-fit-with-a-planners-fiduciary-duty",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I admit that I have always been a little uncomfortable with some aspects of MPT, and have long held the view that broad portfolio diversification is often a safe path to average performance. A superb piece of research on \"The Case For Long Termism\" has made me ask the question \"diversification is a safe path for who?\"</p><p> In exploring the issue of long-term thinking and clarity of investment strategy, the author (Ambachtsheer) delivered an excellent analogy for financial planners. It also raises the question in my mind as to whether concentration of investment, or high conviction investing, is the natural path for those with genuine long-term views and strategic clarity.</p><p> There is no doubt that long-term thinking and investment in the future reaps its rewards. The analogy woven through Ambachtsheer's research is that of the shift from subsistence societies where virtually all decisions are short-term focused: subsistence societies exist in survival mode, and the concept of putting aside resources or food stocks for another day is, perhaps, a luxury. The move to do so however is what triggered the birth of \"investing\". Deferring consumption today in order to accumulate future resources that require less personal effort or risk is the essence of wealth accumulation as we know it.</p><p> However, humans, being the fickle creatures they tend to be, will often make short-term decisions for immediate personal gain which are at odds with the long-term objective. Over time, businesses evolved and then created governance structures to minimise the ability for a single errant human to compromise the long-term strategy.</p><p> Adding in the issue of information asymmetry in investment markets together with the desire to negate short-termism saw the rise of intermediaries - which brings me to the question of whether a diversification strategy fits the client's objectives or the planner's.</p><p> I know, I know... heresy. Nobel Prize winners have been lauded for their work in this area, and I have no academic right to question them. But here's the thing - I know a lot of wealthy people, and pretty much all of them made their wealth by concentrating on a very few things. For many, it was concentrated on a single thing, such as a business idea or one single investment strategy. I don't know anyone who got seriously rich from saving fortnightly in managed funds. Certainly there is a place for that, and many sound arguments for their use, particularly in the early accumulation phase for individual investors.</p><p> But these empirical observations of what actually works in creating wealth, together with the performance evidence of long-term concentrated (high conviction) investors such as Warren Buffett and John Maynard Keynes do leave me questioning diversification as a strategy for long- term wealth creation. That, in turn, has me wondering about the role of a fiduciary. As Ambachtsheer put it: \"Increasingly, fiduciary behaviour and decisions will be judged not by a cookie-cutter off-the-shelf \"prudent person\" standard (but) by a much broader \"reasonable expectations\" standard.\"</p><p> The increasing focus on best practice governance standards and mandate management by investment houses is a distinct shift towards higher fiduciary standards for the industry as a whole, with implicit recognition of the need to manage for a wider group of stakeholders than any individual client. Is it unreasonable to expect that this approach, and mood to manage for the long-term good of all stakeholders, will eventually permeate down to individual planner level? Does the planner have a fiduciary responsibility to those other stakeholders in the client's life, such as other family members who are not fee-paying clients themselves?</p>",

    "content": "<p> The more mature a company is, the harder it becomes to differentiate sufficiently in the marketplace. Complacency can set in, it can be tough to change course in time or to recognize when competitors are actually chipping away at the foundations until its too late. </p><p> Sometimes, the &ldquo;easiest&rdquo; response is to drop prices. By the time this happens, your company is well on the way to becoming a commodity &ndash; unrecognizable from competitors, no higher perceived value and an uphill battle to regain the status of &ldquo;preference&rdquo;. Once a commodity, products and services can compete on price alone. A lower priced competitor can be all that it takes to lose the sale. Every sale.</p><p> &ldquo;Successful brands start to fade when they lose clear points of differentiation. Absent differentiation, the core of any brand and its associated business &mdash; a loyal customer base &mdash; cannot be created or sustained.&rdquo;</p><p> Enter the &ldquo;Branded Differentiator.&rdquo; A differentiator is a unique feature and/or benefit of a product, or aspects of a brand, that set it apart from competing products or brands. A Branded Differentiator is something that your company owns, names and manages as a key difference in the marketplace. A differentiator must be something that your customers care enough about that they will select you. It must be manageable by your internal structure, it must be worth investing in and it must truly be a differentiating factor from competitors. Even better if it&rsquo;s truly unique.</p><p> A differentiator can be an  <strong>  Ingredient </strong> ,  like Intel inside a Dell computer or Gore-Tex in a North Face coat, a  <strong>  Program/Process </strong> , a  <strong>  Feature </strong>  or a  <strong>  Service </strong> .</p><p> How many differentiators should your company have? It depends on how many audiences profiles you have. My recommendation is that 2-4 strong branded differentiators are all that you need or that your customers can remember.</p><p> Differentiators can include your  <strong>  Heritage </strong> , whether you are  <strong>  First </strong>  at something, whether you have a  <strong>  Unique Story </strong>  that you can tell, a  <strong>  Guarantee </strong>  that you offer or any of the 50 differentiators listed in this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2013/12/50-ways-to-differentiate-your-brand.html#.VQcw5BDF86l\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   great article  </a> </u> .</p><p> Differentiation should take place as early as possible in the life of a business and constantly re-evaluated for relevance and uniqueness.

    "content": "<p> Reverse Mortgages Warning: Hidden Pitfalls and Consumer Complaints</p><p> Heavy advertising by those selling reverse mortgages could convince anyone that this product will get you to nirvana. The sellers tout them, promising to let you &ldquo;live the life of your dreams&rdquo; or &ldquo;have a better retirement&rdquo;.  Really?</p><p> The Federal government has responded to numerous complaints by borrowers about reverse mortgages (home equity conversion mortgages or HECMs) and issued a summary report.  It&rsquo;s available through the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  </a> </u>  but if you don&rsquo;t have time to read it, we summarize for you it here at  <u>  <a href=\"http://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com.  </a> </u></p><p> The reverse mortgage complaints submitted to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   CFPB  </a> </u>  demonstrate the wide range of problems some consumers have with these loans. The largest volume of complaints, according to the report, center on difficulty in trying to change the terms of the loans. When borrowers want to refinance the loan or add borrowers, they can&rsquo;t.  Some borrowers do not understand that the loan proceeds as well as accrued interest on the loan over time substantially decrease the amount of available equity. What this tells us at  <u>  <a href=\"http://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com  </a> </u>  is that despite mandatory &ldquo;counseling&rdquo; before getting the mortgage, the borrower is not getting the message. Whether that is a defect in the counseling itself or the consumer being swayed by the &ldquo;live the life of your dreams&rdquo; advertising we do not know.  What we do know is that borrowers get upset when they find out they can&rsquo;t refinance these loans.</p><p> Other consumers complain that lenders refuse to lower their loans&rsquo; interest rates and they feel that as interest rates have declined, that they&rsquo;re being overcharged.  Trying to change the terms of the loan at all is very problematic. When adult children want to be added as borrowers they can&rsquo;t be added. Borrowers do not understand that adult children can only retain the home for an aging parent by paying off the entire loan balance or by paying 95% of the value of the home. Is this a failure to understand the mandatory counseling their parents were given? Or is it that this critical detail is lost in the effort to get an older homeowner to take the loan, &ldquo;live the life of their dreams&rdquo;  and have a wonderful time with the loan proceeds?</p><p> As we see it, the worst outcome of a reverse mortgage occurs when title is transferred to one spouse in order to get the HECM, perhaps because he or she is  of an age that makes it possible to borrow more equity than the other spouse could do.  The loan is taken in the name of that one spouse only. The borrowing spouse later dies.  The non-borrowing spouse then will lose the home. Distraught widows and widowers face foreclosure in this scenario. Of course they can&rsquo;t pay off the loan or they wouldn&rsquo;t have needed the HECM in the first place.  Some consumers report that their loan originator falsely assured them they would be able to add the other spouse to the loan at a later date.</p><p> The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is changing this horrible problem.  It issued a mortgagee letter in August 2014 that provides that non-borrowing spouses meeting certain conditions, may remain in the home after the death of the borrower spouse but only for loans originated after the date of this letter.  Most HECMs originated after August 4, 2014 will be made in both spouses&rsquo; names. For the rest of the many borrowers whose loans are older than that, a widowed person will likely lose the home after the borrowing spouse dies.  So much for living the life of their dreams.</p><p> If you are in a position to advise clients about the pros and cons of a reverse mortgage, be sure that you know these details before directing anyone to such a loan.  Yes, in some cases, a HECM can be a lifesaver.  But as we see it, that&rsquo;s only a good idea when there are no other options available to pay the basic cost of living in the home and surviving there to the end of life. It&rsquo;s not prudent for any consumer to have a lavish lifestyle on borrowed money, only to run out of equity when they need money most: when disabled and in need of care. Consumers need to be cautioned not to take out equity and recklessly spend it as if there were no consequences to depleting what is for many, their only significant asset.</p><p> Help us keep elders informed.  Please share this with a friend, a client or member of your own family.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> My first FBI supervisor was a tall, affable guy named Bill who tended to assign the sticky cases to the newest agent on the squad&mdash;me. Bill handed me a dog-eared file that had obviously been kicked around for a few years. The case was so old that one of the witnesses had died! </h3><p> <br/> I started to complain but Bill held up his hand and said, &ldquo;What I expect from you is an adventurous response.&rdquo;</p><p> I had joined the FBI because I was seeking something unique and exciting, and the more I thought about Bill&rsquo;s admonition, I realized that adventure can not only be found in  our experiences, it can also be found in the way we think.</p><p> An adventurous response is looking for the possibility in every situation, even when it doesn&rsquo;t look all that great at first glance. Bill&rsquo;s suggestion brought me to a closer understanding of the role of  <u>  positive thinking </u>  in developing  <u>  mental toughness </u> . I was a new agent, but Bill understood that by focusing my attention on the positive aspects of my case, I would mature into the kind of person who looked at both life and work as an adventure.</p><p> When leaders have an adventurous response to life&rsquo;s vicissitudes, they can conquer the world.</p><p> Here are 9 ways:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Start Early and Win the Morning </strong></h3><p> <br/> If it takes caffeine to get you started in the morning, go for a full cup. If you procrastinate in starting your day, what does that foretell about the way you&rsquo;ll approach the rest of it? Eat a good breakfast, pray, read the Bible, workout&mdash;feed your mind, body, and soul first thing every morning. </p><h3> <strong>  2. Surround Yourself with Successful People </strong></h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/5-ways-to-pick-friends-wisely/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pick your friends with care  </a> </u> &mdash;they create the environment in which you will either thrive or wilt. Give everyone the opportunity to be a friend, but share your dreams and goals only with those who value them as much as you do.</p><p> If you surround yourself with positive people who build you up and believe in you, you can conquer the world. No matter how many you have in your network, if you want to be truly successful you will need three types of people:</p><li> Those who are older and more successful to learn from</li><li> Those who are your contemporaries for encouragement</li><li> Those who are below you in experience to keep you energized <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  3. Believe and Act As If Everything Is a Gift </strong></h3><p> Instead of appearing like Pollyanna, think about it like this: Assuming everything is a gift is a great way of looking at the problems that will undoubtedly pop up in life and business.  <u>  Choose an adventurous response by remaining positive </u>  so you are not intimidated by obstacles.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Write in a Journal </strong></h3><p> <br/> Goals, dreams, and ideas that are not written down are not real.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/5-reasons-why-you-should-commit-your-goals-to-writing.html?utm_source=Michael+Hyatt+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=4435b6e355-rssdaily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d1fa5823d7-4435b6e355-250251633\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Journals  </a> </u>  can:</p><li> Force you to clarify what you want</li><li> Motivate you to take action</li><li> Filter the best opportunities</li><li> Help overcome resistance</li><li> Enable you to celebrate your progress <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  5. Engage in Mindfulness, Prayer, Meditation, or Yoga On a Daily Basis </strong></h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iopenerinstitute.com/what-are-the-financial-benefits.aspx?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research  </a> </u>  has shown that the benefits of mindfulness are not just for individual health, but also for corporate bottom lines. Stress-reduction doesn&rsquo;t just make us happier and healthier, it&rsquo;s a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/corporate-wellness_b_2903222.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   proven competitive advantage  </a> </u>  for any business that wants one.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Ask Questions, Lots of Them, Always </strong></h3><p> <br/> Raising new questions, exploring possibilities, and regarding old problems from a new angle activates our imagination and stimulates our thinking. Continually ask yourself these questions:</p><li> What is my purpose on earth?</li><li> Where is my heart telling me to go?</li><li> What should I stop doing?</li><li> What should I start doing?</li><li> What is my petri dish? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  7. Try, Try, and Then Try Again </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you want to try something new, you will fail at first; if you don&rsquo;t fail, then it wasn&rsquo;t really anything new at all.  <u>  Failure is a wonderfully clarifying process </u>  because if you fail and give up, then you&rsquo;re heart wasn&rsquo;t in it. Move on so you can get somewhere better.</p><p> If, however, you fail and do not accept defeat, keep at it until you find the secret to unlocking the potential, in both yourself and your obstacle.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Start At the End, and Then Don&rsquo;t Stop There </strong></h3><p> <br/> Decide what you want to do, who you want to be, and where you want to end up. You cannot conquer the world setting average goals for yourself.  Aim at nothing and you will hit it every time  ( <u>  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/eeZYs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click to tweet  </a> </u> ). </p><p> Never start small where goals are concerned.  Most people don&rsquo;t set goals too high and miss; they set goals too low and hit  ( <u>  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/0d2C7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click to tweet  </a> </u> ). Your decisions will be better when your ultimate goal is ultimate success. </p><h3> <strong>  9. Don&rsquo;t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow </strong></h3><p> <br/> Setting and achieving a goal isn&rsquo;t the finish line for people who are successful. Achieving one goal is simply a launching pad for the next huge goal. </p><p> When you become successful in one field, you will find that you have the skill set to be remarkably successful in other fields. Do not settle for running one race. Expect and plan to win a number of them.</p><p> Mental toughness is choosing how you respond to life&rsquo;s circumstances rather than leaving things to chance. Once you do, you can conquer the world.</p><p> Any tips to offer on how people can conquer their world?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> How do you measure good customer service and why is it important to sales people?</p><p> It's really quite simple. Good customer service means that you feel comfortable with a brand and it increases brand loyalty which then helps sales people with new business development.</p><p>  As you know, I am a consultative sales specialist and my company offers a consultative sales training program but many of our clients work with us, enrolling their customer service teams in our program. Why? Because the art of listening and meeting a need that we teach in our program is as important when talking to existing clients as it is when selling to prospects.</p><p> <strong>  What is good customer service? </strong></p><p> Is it important that customer service people are attentive, courteous and compassionate? Yes, of course it is but what matters most is that at every single step of the interaction they keep in mind that they need to resolve an issue. If the issue is not resolved at the end of the interaction, the service was not good, no matter how friendly the exchange. In order to resolve an issue, one needs to listen and identify it.</p><p> <strong>  Focus on resolving the issue </strong></p><p> Recently, I had a frustrating experience with my wireless provider (what else is new?). One of my devices wasn't working and I needed it for business travel. While the person on the other end of the phone was nice and friendly, he missed the reason why I was frustrated and was trying to resolve an issue that didn't exist. I won't bore you with the details, but in a nutshell there was a lack of understanding and listening.</p><p> <strong>  Just being friendly can be annoying </strong></p><p> They wanted to fix the device and not the problem.  I was literally on the phone with customer service and tech support for four hours over two days. First they had me delete and re-install the software, re-start my laptop multiple times. Then they had me go to the local corporate store to replace the SIM card. When that didn't work either, they decided to send a whole new device, that also didn't work.</p><p> <strong>  Address the issue </strong></p><p> No matter what was suggested to me during the hour long conversations with various people including management, nobody really understood my problem. Everybody was trying to fix the device and not the problem.</p><p> <strong>  Sometimes in sales AND in customer service you need to be creative </strong></p><p> Finally after hours of conversations, pleading and almost threatening, a really compassionate supervisor got on the phone and started to think out of the box. He listened to what I had to say and we both came up with an alternate solution that fixed my issue, at least in the short term which was me being able to access the internet while traveling.</p><p> <strong>  Scripts should be recommended guidelines </strong></p><p> Everyone was trying to help me at each step of the process, but only to the extent as guidelines allowed them to. They put me through a process that robbed me of many hours, while it seemed that the script didn't leave any room for thinking and/or decision making.</p><p> <strong>  What does customer service mean? </strong></p><p> The words \"Customer Service\" means that you service a customer to find a solution to a problem, issue or concern. It doesn't mean that you read from scripts and apply procedures to comply with company policy.</p><p> <strong>  And, how does this hurt sales? </strong></p><p> In this new way of engaging through social media, news travel a lot faster and the word gets out, so a bad customer experience can hurt new sales.  That's just the way it works. In working to keep your customers happy with your service or product, there&rsquo;s not much difference between a customer service employee and sales person representing your product or service. Sales people are often the first introduction to a company, but if customer service representatives don't satisfy a need, which was clearly the case in my situation, it's hard for sales people to stand by a sale with integrity.</p><p> <strong>  Your script should guide you, not control you </strong></p><p> What is more important is that sales and customer service people need to be trained in a way that they use a script as a guideline and not as the only option. </p>",

    "link": "want-to-cut-complexity-kill-your-darlings",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There are plenty of generic strategic choices to drive a business forward. Risk-averse CEOs find comfort in the &lsquo;doing more of the same&rsquo; strategic mode. Yet, when things get tough, they quickly knee-jerk into &lsquo;doing more of the same, with less.&rsquo; Some leaders strive for scale by &lsquo;doing more with less,&rsquo; usually meaning fewer employees. Optimists favor &lsquo;doing more with more,&rsquo; placing bets that higher sales and profits will pay for the added investments in headcount or technologies; we&rsquo;ve all been there at one time or another.</p><p> The strategy I&rsquo;ve grown to love and count on over a 45-year career is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dolessbetter.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   do less, better  </a> </u> . A long time ago, this ethic saved a near-bankrupt company that I had a part in restructuring. To rise from the ashes, our young management team made several tough sacrifices to transform a multi-product, multi-brand operation from generalist to specialist. Specialists beat generalists &ndash; always have, always will.</p><h3> <strong>  Specialists beat generalists &ndash; always have, always will </strong></h3><p> <br/> This turnaround occurred at Jacobs Suchard&rsquo;s North American operation, eventually sold to Kraft/Mondelez after many years of profitable growth as a coffee specialist. Like many giants, Kraft has thrived by doing more with less, thanks to several acquisitions and the ensuing power of clout. Don&rsquo;t for a minute think that Kraft&rsquo;s top tier profit returns will be deflated by the recent split into two companies. The new Mondelez boasts sales of $35 billion, and the business that remains Kraft generates $18 billion. $18 billion is still a hell of a lot of cheese slices, bowls of peanuts, and cups of coffee. </p><p> For companies without clout, competitive advantage can be realized by keeping things simple, by cutting out the complexity cancer that is crippling so many enterprises. The lesson learned from the Jacobs Suchard turnaround was that strategic sacrifice in the right places is the secret to nimbleness, resiliency, and coherence. Strategic sacrifice begins at 30,000 feet with corporate strategy. The principle then travels down through the various functions, and ends at sea level with an individual&rsquo;s daily &ldquo;to do list.&rdquo; This journey isn&rsquo;t an easy one. People are so entrenched in the do more paradigm that they struggle to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lisaspangenberg.com/writing/murder-your-darlings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   kill their darlings  </a> </u> , dump all of those exciting initiatives, and sacred cows, and resist adding more features to a product.</p><h3> <strong>  Have the Courage to Kill Your Darlings </strong></h3><p> <br/> According to Bob Olodort, the product designer of the recently launched Ditto notification wearable device, Samsung is snagged in the complexity web. Recently, on  <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/16/for-29-this-wearable-has-no-display-no-lights-no-gimmicks-but-it-could-be-indispensible/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   VentureBeat.com  </a> </u> , Olodort chastised his former client for not sticking to the principles of product simplicity and elegance. Seemingly, continually adding features throughout the development chain is the Samsung culture. Each engineer has a pet feature they&rsquo;d like included in Samsung phones. Ditto (pardon the pun) the carriers who buy the phones. Olodort says that by time you buy Samsung, you&rsquo;ve got a phone &ldquo;crammed with complexity and redundant features.&rdquo;</p><p> The strategic choice to cut back product features, and curb the insatiable desire to do more and more, must come from the top. To do that, Samsung&rsquo;s leaders must sacrifice the egos of their engineers. Sure, there will be a fallout. There was fallout when Marissa Mayer killed Yahoo&rsquo;s popular  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2013/02/25/back-to-the-stone-age-new-yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-bans-working-from-home/\" target=\"_blank\">   work-from-home policy  </a> </u> . The essence of sacrifice in her mind was giving up something of value for another consideration; when people are together they are more collaborative and innovative.</p>",

And, we're not talking fancy drinks here, just coffee and milk (and just one a day)!  If, instead, you redirected the $109 a month toward savings, assuming a 6% rate of return, the accumulation potential is major.</p><p> <strong>  Investment Time           Value Just Over </strong></p><p> 15 years                              $31k</p><p> 20 years                              $50k</p><p> 25 years                              $75k</p><p> 30 years                              $109k</p><p> Some of you may be thinking, \"'I don't have coffee, I don't work. I don't work, I don't make money. I don't make money, I don't save money.'\"  We get it.  We love those little warm cups with our misspelled names just as much as you.  We aren't trying to stage an intervention here.  Our point is that it's important to look at the annual cost of small indulgences so you can mindfully decide whether your dollars are really going toward what's important to you or not.  So, if not coffee, consider other ways to cut back - perhaps something that won't cause such nasty withdrawals.</p><p> Not a Subscriber?   <u>  <a href=\"https://app.e2ma.net/app2/audience/signup/1770810/1714656/?v=a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SUBSCRIBE HERE  </a> </u>  for our weekly email.  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Some Tips For Dealing With &lsquo;Trolls&rsquo; </strong></p><p> Unfortunately, the internet has more than its fair share of &lsquo;haters&rsquo;. And plenty of other people simply seem to have far too much time on their hands. This means that whatever your business, it's likely that at you will at some point receive negative comments on your social media pages; and nowadays, the way you handle so-called &lsquo;trolls&rsquo; can have very a real impact on your company's image and online presence.</p><p> <strong>  A useful recent article on Social Media Examiner shared some thoughts on how businesses should deal with this kind of behaviour. Here&rsquo;s my pick of the best tips&hellip; </strong></p><p> <strong>  Use humour (carefully) </strong></p><p> Nothing disarms a troll better than humour. Rather than ignoring a negative tweet or comment, acknowledge the criticism it contains and try to turn it into a witty and humorous response. When done tactfully, it can defuse any anger the person might have felt, and it paints your business in a great light, too.</p><p> <strong>  Combat fiction with fact </strong></p><p> Rumours spread quickly online, so it's best to put them to bed as soon as possible. For example, when the internet became obsessed with #bendgate after claims that Apple's new iPhone6 was doing a &lsquo;Yuri Geller' in people's pockets, Apple addressed the problem head-on. Apple admitted there had been a problem, but also put things in proper perspective by pointing out that they had actually only received nine complaints about phones being bent. This fact showed that the problem was far smaller than the numerous comedy memes made out.</p><p> <strong>  Don't try to fight fire with fire </strong></p><p> In some cases, brands decide it's a good idea to get their own back by engaging a bit of 'corporate trolling' in an attempt to be down with the kids. Take Tesco Mobile, who ran their #nojoke initiative of responding to negative comments with 'hilarious' (read 'obnoxious') derogatory replies.</p><p> Whilst humour can be a good thing, trying to troll your followers is an extremely risky strategy - particularly if your business is just starting off and people aren't familiar with your values or tone of voice. Instead, play it safe and portray your company as one that's likeable and approachable. Basically, take mum&rsquo;s advice: if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all!</p><p> What other advice do you have for dealing with social media trolls?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Maybe I&rsquo;m na&iuml;ve, but I don&rsquo;t believe that employees consciously show up the first day on a new job and say <strong>  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I am engaged or not, I just need to collect a paycheck.&rdquo; </strong> Okay, so there are some people who ultimately end up feeling that way and have chosen to emotionally quit while still physically sitting in their chair at work but that&rsquo;s not usually how the journey begins.</p><p> We start off by wanting not just to date, but also to get married to our company&rsquo;s mission, vision and purpose.  We all desire to feel highly connected with what we do. Engagement is what motivates people not only to feel dedicated to their job and their life, but also to feel rewarded by what they do and how they do it. It pushes people to look at things differently and go above and beyond, not because they have to, but because they want to.</p><p> Engagement is buying in, going all in, and remaining within and contributing to the passion and mission of our company. It&rsquo;s what separates the striving companies from the thriving ones, the happy folks from the unhappy ones, the smiles from the frowns, and the success stories from the shattered dreams.  The end of the journey should be to find an environment where you can thrive, not just survive day-to-day.</p><p> <strong>  Engaged employees have 3 main characteristics in how they show up and behave at work. They are: </strong></p><li> Collaborative</li><li> Creative</li><li> Loyal <br/>  </li><p> They look forward to working with others for the good of the organization and are filled with ideas about how to make it even better.  They are aligned with what their company stands for and are fully committed to making them successful.</p><p> As with any long road trip, things can happen along the way to derail the journey.  You might run out of gas, come upon a detour or unknowingly hit a pothole that leaves you with a flat tire.  These are all analogies for falling into disengagement on the job, no matter the reason why.</p><p> <strong>  How can someone tell if their employee (or themselves) have indeed hit that proverbial pothole in the road? Here are my 7 warning signs to look out for on your &lsquo;dashboard&rsquo; of engagement. </strong></p><li> An &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rsquo; attitude</li><li> More frequent episodes of lateness, leaving early or calling in sick</li><li> Productivity declines along with quality</li><li> Frequent mood swings</li><li> Isolating themselves from others</li><li> Lack of creativity</li><li> Lethargic, low energy <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  One doesn&rsquo;t need to have all 7 of these warning signs to show up to signify disengagement.  </strong> As with any kind of dashboard warning sign on a car, even one light can signify a problem that needs to be checked out.  The key is to do proactive maintenance to ensure that the journey ahead will be a smooth one.  Baring that, then quickly recognizing the potential problems and taking steps to fix what&rsquo;s not working is the best way to get back on the road to engagement.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s high tech cars all have dashboard systems that are designed to quickly diagnose a problem and let the driver know something is amiss before it becomes too big a problem to handle. It&rsquo;s too bad we don&rsquo;t have those same sensors in the workplace so it&rsquo;s up to our managers to know the warning signs to look out for before it&rsquo;s too late and the journey ends badly for all involved.</p><p> If you are wondering what&rsquo;s going on with you or someone that works for you and want to do some diagnostics before the problem gets too out of hand, just shoot me an <a href=\"mailto:ruth@rsquaredresources.com\">  email </a> and I will be happy to send you my Invisibility Index&trade; tool to help you identify if disengagement has set in.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+AndrewLisa/posts\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Andrew Lisa  </u> </a></p><p> Customer relationship management (CRM) software can streamline customer-related data, information and processes. This can free up time and resources for the business to focus on improving their products and services. With CRM, businesses can make the sales cycle more predictable and the generation of leads more consistent. CRM can also help nurture those leads and improve the overall customer experience, leading to repeat business.</p><p> <strong>  Using CRM to Get the Most Out of Your Website </strong></p><p> The article \" <u>  <a href=\"http://www.practicesuite.com/practicemanagement/marketing-your-practice-medical-crm-software-simplifies-the-process\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketing Your Practice: Medical CRM Software Simplifies the Process  </a> </u> \" examines how medical professionals use CRM software in the pursuit of leads. Instead of a website acting simply as a home for physician lists and contact information, hospitals and health systems can use CRM to generate and nurture leads. CRM gathers and analyzes customer contact information, and can even suggest changes to a website depending on demographics. If a hospital is targeting people in a specific geographic region, for example, CRM software may spur a change in SEO wording.</p><p> <strong>  Email Lists and Databases </strong></p><p> CRM software can be instrumental in creating and managing customer email lists and databases. With CRM, some email processes can be automated, whether it's an auto mechanic sending automatic reminders to repeat customers to get their oil changed, or a hardware store sending thank you messages at the holidays. When CRM builds and maintains databases and automates email functions, the actual human beings at the business have far more time and resources to serve their customers.</p><p> <strong>  Scheduling and Calendar Interaction </strong></p><p> Email and customer databases are not the only area where CRM can provide automation to create extra time and resources for businesses to use in the pursuit of more important things. CRM software can link with calendar applications and Google tools such as Docs. This takes the grunt work out of scheduling, not only freeing up time, but minimizing &ndash; or altogether eliminating &ndash; scheduling mistakes. This also enables different branches, different departments and different offices to access and share schedules.</p><p> From the automation of scheduling and emailing to the improvement of website functionality, CRM software can help your business free up time and resources, all while improving customer service. CRM can manage targeted campaigns and contact segmentation to boost not just the quantity, but the quality of leads. With CRM, businesses can use shared email lists, shared schedules and shared databases to make communication a strong suit for businesses in any industry.</p><p> NOTE: Many of the CRM functions are applicable to remaining in touch with recruiters and companies of interest making the job hunt far more efficient, too.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/108897242618977470844/posts?rel=author\" target=\"_blank\">   Andrew Lisa  </a> </u>  is a freelance business writer.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Every now and then, I feel a little trapped. </strong></p><p> Not by people, not by places, and not by things.</p><p> When I catch myself with this feeling, I start to question it. &ldquo;What changed to make me feel this way?&rdquo;</p><p> Nothing in the outside world looks different.  <br/> No massive event. <br/> No huge transition I can&rsquo;t handle.</p><p> But I feel a little stuck. <br/> A little unhappy. <br/> And a little confused. </p><p> I look around and recognize that I have everything I need. And despite feeling grateful, I think &ldquo;What gives? Why do I feel this way?\"</p><p> After a few cycles of doing this and a healthy dose of obsessive self-analysis, I noticed that in moments where I feel mysteriously off for no good reason, I&rsquo;ve unplugged.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve disconnected from myself and started going on autopilot.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve prioritized doing all the things that &ldquo;need to get done&rdquo; and skimped on the things that connect me to myself.</p><p> Suddenly, my must-haves (healthy foods, adequate sleep, movement &amp; meditation) have become nice-to-haves. And, not so surprisingly, nice-to-haves become don&rsquo;t-haves pretty freakin&rsquo; fast.</p><p> I can come up with a dozen or so ways to add that back in, become more accountable to myself, and feel like the real me again. If you&rsquo;ve been following the Blog for a while, you know that I&rsquo;ve already written about that:</p><li> <p>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/how-to-stop-avoiding-yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    How to Stop Avoiding Yourself   </a>  </u> </p></li><li> <p>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/3-steps-to-regain-happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    3 Steps to Regain Your Happiness   </a>  </u> </p></li><li> <p>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/how-to-deal-when-things-dont-go-according-to-plan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    How to Deal When Things Don't Go According to Plan   </a>  </u> </p></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/how-to-stop-settling-for-less-than-you-deserve\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   How To Stop Settling For Less Than You Deserve  </u> </a></li><p> <br/> ​Despite all that, I've never written about the first and most important step to reconnecting with yourself. Let's use my inner crazy as an example, shall we? As a coach, I&rsquo;m great at coming up with creative strategies. As a normal human being, there are times I get stuck in judgment or can&rsquo;t get out of my own head.</p><p> I start to wonder, &ldquo;what if I can&rsquo;t connect to myself again? Will I always feel like this?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What if this spirals into what those pedantic spiritual gurus call &lsquo;being asleep?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;d like to consider this thought pattern adorably neurotic, but in reality, it&rsquo;s just annoyingly neurotic. I overthink it until I imagine that I&rsquo;m so far gone that I&rsquo;ll need a massive shift involving a shaman, a cave made of crystals, and a week without wifi.</p><p> I think that I need some sort of overhaul or cleanse to fix me.</p><p> And that exact thinking is why I&rsquo;m off in the first place. Because I forget that I&rsquo;m not broken. I can access my intuition, higher self, and inner awesome whenever I want.</p><p> <strong>  How? </strong></p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t require candles, crystals, or a third thing that begins with a &ldquo;c&rdquo; that I can&rsquo;t think of.</p><p> All it takes is willingness.</p><p> You&rsquo;re probably rolling your eyes right now. I don&rsquo;t blame you. It seems too simple, too stupid, and too &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; to create real change. Humor me on this one and:</p><p> Imagine if you had the willingness to see your situation differently.</p><p> Imagine if you were willing to reconnect simply as is.</p><p> What would that feel like in your body? </p><p> There, you did it.</p><p> Sometimes all you need is the willingness to reconnect.</p><p> <strong>  SO HERE&rsquo;S MY CHALLENGE TO YOU: </strong></p><p> Before you sign up for some uber-expensive meditation retreat. Simply state the following <strong>  &ldquo;I am willing to see this differently. I am willing to connect to myself.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Then, stand back and watch the miracles flow in.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m busy blowing through emails last week  <u>  and I stumble upon an article titled:  &ldquo;Can a financial advisor improve your sex life? </u> &rdquo; and I stopped cold&hellip;I&rsquo;m totally clicking on this!  [I even joked with a colleague of mine that I couldn&rsquo;t believe I saw this.]</p><p> Disruptive marketing techniques always intrigue me and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/rodneyballance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rodney Ballance  </a> </u>  did just that &ndash; he disrupted my usual day with a title that literally reached out and grabbed my attention.  As I clicked the link I just kept thinking, &ldquo;I hope this delivers!&rdquo; And it did!</p><p> We don&rsquo;t have to get into the actual content of Rodney&rsquo;s article because  <u>  you really should go out and read it </u>  &ndash; he makes a valid argument to his point.  What I&rsquo;m truly interested in and want to make sure we don&rsquo;t make light of is using different marketing tactics to grab attention.  We have mere seconds to be in the face of someone &ndash; are you sure you&rsquo;re content is resonating?</p><p> Some ways you can do this are easier than you think.  Let&rsquo;s start with Stopping The Lovefest!  One of the things I study is behavioral metrics of people.  Basically, I look at normal human behavior and then qualify and quantify how you do what you do in face-to-face engagement vs. online.  For example, if you open Facebook, your eye immediately darts to the upper right hand side to see if you have any notifications.  Much like Starbucks has taught you how to order a coffee in their language, Facebook has taught you the importance of notifications.  The higher the number, the more &ldquo;thrill&rdquo; you feel.  Kind of lame, right?  But it&rsquo;s how we process information &ndash; and that&rsquo;s important to understand.  This is where the lovefest has killed our curiosity!  Aren&rsquo;t you sick of &ldquo;Likes&rdquo; at this point?  Don&rsquo;t you like it when someone disagrees with you?  We like to engage and we can&rsquo;t engage with a Like&hellip;so stopping the lovefest is a way to be a disruptive marketer.</p><p> Instead of agreeing or writing all this lovey-dovey crap, take a stand on something and spill your guts on why.  People love it!  It&rsquo;s refreshing to experience a point of view instead of an &lsquo;atta boy!&rsquo;  You&rsquo;ll likely get more engagement and depending how you go about it, more respect.  Be mindful, I&rsquo;m not saying you should be a jerk.  I&rsquo;m saying you should pick a topic and explain your why.  It&rsquo;s ok to disagree &ndash; just be diplomatic!</p><p> Another way you can be disruptive is to Expose Your Vulnerability! Guess what?  We don&rsquo;t know everything.  So find something you don&rsquo;t know a lot about and start asking your connections for information about how something works, where something is located, how something tastes, etc.  Let your followers and friends be the center of attention.  They will enjoy telling you what they know and you will engage them in a way that makes them feel good.  Win &ndash; win!</p><p> You could even Compare Notes with your fans.  You have a Fitbit and so do your friends and family, then start a thread talking about ways you are using your Fitbit and invite them to the conversation.  This is sort of a lovefest chat, but you&rsquo;re not controlling the conversation &ndash; they are, and that&rsquo;s what you want!  It could be anything:  books, cars, workout gear, etc.  Avoid personal things that relate to religion and politics.  You want this to be a fun conversation, not an emotionally draining one.</p><p> So again &ndash; my hat is off to Rodney Ballance for jumping out of my emailbox last week.  He inspired me to write this article and I hope his article inspires you to do something different too&hellip;and be sure to tell us what you&rsquo;re going to try!</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Many brands are creating engaging, well-planned and useful  <u>  content </u>  as part of their  <u>  content marketing </u>  strategy. But in this post, I&rsquo;m talking about the other guy. The one that practices the wrong content marketing. Without naming names, I&rsquo;ll provide some examples of what not to do, and why not to do it.</p><p> <strong>  The beggar </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;ll find many posts asking for likes, begging for re-tweets, and shamelessly pleading for shares.</p><p> Would you do that in person? No. Then don&rsquo;t do so on a social media channel either; it&rsquo;s precisely the wrong content marketing scheme.</p><p> If instead you created a piece of content, something funny for example, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to beg for likes and shares.</p><p> <strong>  The vote </strong></p><p> Next, brands that ask the audience to vote on an A or B choice via &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;share.&rdquo; Like if you think A, share if you think B.</p><p> What does this offer to your audience? Not a thing. It&rsquo;s just a waste of your time and effort, another wrong content marketing tactic.</p><p> But, an exception is if you spark an emotional reaction or interest for your audience. For example when  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/twix-unveils-rivalry-campaign-pitting-left-bar-against-right-bar-141922\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twix launched a campaign  </a> </u>  pitting the left Twix against the right, they hit the mark. They extended that campaign into their social channels and made it interesting.</p><p> <strong>  The holiday hustle </strong></p><p> Holidays are a frequent excuse for brands to work content into an idea that&rsquo;s already on everyone&rsquo;s mind, but some feel no obligation to be relevant.</p><p> Simply observing a holiday and tossing in a pun doesn&rsquo;t actually make you relevant.</p><p> While a tax preparation company has every reason to comment on the day taxes are due, there&rsquo;s no reason for a toothpaste brand to do so.</p><p> I&rsquo;d compare this to the guy in your office who &ldquo;only does things on days that end in y.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not funny, it provides no value, and it screams of desperation &ndash; and likely makes your co-workers want to scream too.</p><p> <strong>  The calendar culprit </strong></p><p> A staple on the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/corporatebollocks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Condescending Corporate Brand  </a> </u>  page is days of the week posts. They feature some of the laziest and most transparent content marketing on the web.</p><p> Unfortunately, unless you&rsquo;re selling calendars, there&rsquo;s no reason to tell anyone what day it is. Your audience already knows.</p><p> Wishing them a &ldquo;Happy Friday&rdquo; is just talking for the sake of talking. Bemoaning the return of Monday provides zero value.</p><p> A significant amount of it is lazy, just going through the motions to fill the content calendar. The worst of it is insulting, demeaning, and belittles the sensibilities of the very audience you want to reach.</p><p> <strong>  How to get it right </strong></p><p> Find inspiration in the examples on the  <u>  Facebook Studio awards </u> , celebrating the best of brand activity on Facebook and awarding the brands doing it right.</p><p> Your audience will like or share your content if it&rsquo;s worthy, not because you beg them to, they voted for A over B, or it&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day which happens to fall on a Tuesday.</p><p> Provide something of value and make it interesting, avoid the wrong content marketing strategy. That&rsquo;s a sure path to being liked.</p>",

Ideally, you should be building an MVP that is used, iterated on after feedback is received and then pushed out again in front of your audience. This process should repeat until your product has reached product market fit and you are on your way to easy street.</p><p> <strong>  If you have been building in stealth mode, don&rsquo;t bank on a huge launch after months of secrecy. </strong> <br/> Because you haven&rsquo;t been getting feedback and learning from your users, chances are your big launch (no matter how big) will be useless. Without feedback, you don&rsquo;t know if your message resonates with your market or if your app is solving their problem adequately&hellip; feedback is important to your startup. Without feedback you will end up with high churn and will soon be buying your users. And no one likes to pay for play.</p><p> <strong>  Immerse yourself in the industry. </strong> <br/> Adora Cheung actually learned how to clean people&rsquo;s houses and then went and applied that knowledge to do the literal dirty work. She also used her newfound first-hand skillset to improve her offerings and marketing message.</p><p> <strong>  Simplify your message. </strong> <br/> If you know what your customer wants, you can perfectly craft a simple message that they understand. With about 5 seconds to make an impression, if your headline is akin to decoding the labyrinth, your bounce rate will make you cry.</p><p> <strong>  Ask your users their thoughts. </strong> <br/> Once your product is out into the market, don&rsquo;t make your users chase you down. Ask THEM what they think. Hit up the message boards that they frequent and truly listen to what the general consensus is about certain features.</p><p> <strong>  Create a great experience. </strong> <br/> Remember that first time you went to Disney World and Mickey came up to you and shook your hand and your 5-year-old self nearly peed your pants? Well, Walt Disney is a bajillionaire because he knew that it was his job to make customers pee their pants in excitement. Take it upon yourself to do the same every time (well maybe you don&rsquo;t want your customers peeing their pants but happy dances are great too). Wowing them makes referrals second nature, lowers churn, and helps you get Twitter famous.</p><p> Adora Cheung made each of these points sound simple but the fact is growth is one of the hardest things your startup will face. While it is easy to bury your head in the sand and build your product, you won&rsquo;t find many entrepreneurs who will tell you that worked for them. Of course, we have lots of articles on how to score growth wins (like this one  <u>  here </u>  and  <u>  here </u> ) and we encourage you to read them all but just as Adora Cheung suggests, doing is how you&rsquo;ll ultimately win.</p><p> Learn more about Adora Cheung and how she went from zero to a lot of users with her startup Homejoy  <u>  here </u> .</p>",

    "title": "5 Ways You Are Vulnerable to Identity Theft",
    "link": "5-ways-you-are-vulnerable-to-identity-theft",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Woodrow Levin </u></p><p> According to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft is one of the most prevalent non-violent crimes and one that is likely to leave economic, legal, and emotional sequels for years to come.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/spotlight/identity_theft/facts.html\" target=\"_blank\">   In 2013, the CSN (Consumer Sentinel Network) received a little over two million complaints, with many being directly related to identity theft  </a> </u> . Identity theft goes beyond getting your credit card stolen. The CSN reports that many of the issues identified included benefits fraud, utilities fraud, banking fraud, and even employment-related fraud. Every year, about seven percent of the total U.S. population will be victimized by this crime. In most instances, the type of fraud experienced relates to the use of existing financial accounts for unauthorized transactions.</p><p> Every day those involved in identity theft become far more sophisticated in the way they get hold of personal data. A month does not go by without us hearing in the news about data-breach issues affecting millions of customers from chain stores to online websites. There is very little that can be done when identity theft happens in bulk, and data is stolen from businesses that had a heightened responsibility to safeguard our information. While generally speaking you cannot avoid this type of compromise, there are things you are doing on a daily basis that put your identity at risk. Knowing what types of behaviors are risky is your best defense when it comes to guarding your identity. Let&rsquo;s take a look at five common vulnerabilities that are putting your personal information at risk.</p><p> <strong>  Your Online Storage Habits Are Too Liberal </strong> <br/> There thousands of interfaces, tools, and apps that promise to help you make life easier, but before you click &ldquo;accept,&rdquo; take a look at the security features of each tool. Many of these tools allow you to store your personal information in environments that are unencrypted and unsecured. A freebie could cost you more than you ever imagined if you are freely disclosing information that could provide someone with criminal intent access to your financial information. If it is not from a trusted source or you are being asked for ongoing access to personal information available in your devices, then move on and live without it. If you have personal and private documents that need storage, then the best approach is to have an  <u>  online digital safe deposit box </u>  with mechanisms in place to protect your cloud-stored data.</p><p> <strong>  Your Mobile Devices Don&rsquo;t Have a Password </strong> <br/> This is a very common habit and one that is putting many people in danger. When a criminal has access to your unsecured phone, it is not only your identity and your privacy at risk. Through an open portal, you are giving the criminal unprecedented access to your social and business network. Without a password, your email, your social media, and even some banking accounts become a free-for-all. We know having a password is a nuisance, and we all want to live in a perfect world where we never misplace our phone or have it stolen, but the reality is very different. The number of mobile devices that go missing is in the millions, and your device could potentially become the next phone for &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/brother-orange-matt-stopera-iphone/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   Brother Orange  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  You Have Had the Same Password Since 1999 </strong> <br/> Not only have you kept your four-character password for your Hotmail account, but you have also decided that the same password is good enough for every single gated website. Failure to regularly update your passwords compromises the access to your most important accounts. Even if someone is just able to access your email, chances are your email contains enough personal information to put you in a vulnerable position and compromise your identity.</p><p> <strong>  Libraries and Internet Cafes Are Part of Your Daily Routine </strong> <br/> Utilizing public computers to access private and financially sensitive information is a no-no. Gone are the days when personal devices were price prohibitive, forcing individuals to use public computers available through libraries or Internet cafes. Internet-capable devices can be purchased for under one hundred dollars. Avoiding Internet cafes is of particular importance when you are traveling overseas. Many are set up to capture keystrokes, thus taking over your passwords. If for some reason out of your control you are forced to use a public computer, then make sure you erase all history prior to leaving. While not foolproof, it will at least ensure the next user does not have accidental access to your personal passwords.</p><p> <strong>  You Are Careless About the Management and Disposal of Your Snail Mail </strong> <br/> We are always surprised at the high number of individuals that discard mail containing personal information without first shredding it. Discarding mail with personal information puts you at significant risk of identity theft. Your identity is especially at risk if your garbage is disposed in a common dumpster, such as the ones used in apartment complexes. Unscrupulous individuals often dumpster dive in hopes of finding bits and pieces of personal information that will allow them to take over your identity. Don&rsquo;t make it easy. Shredding only takes a few minutes and could save you a great deal of heartache and headaches.</p><p> Anyone who has suffered identity theft will tell you that it is no fun. Get into the habit of taking care of the information that matters the most: your own. If you are already using Safe by Estate Assist why not consider adding  <u>  Estate Guard identity theft protection </u> . For just pennies a day our team will take care of the most important tasks associated to identity theft monitoring and identity restoration. Additionally, should the compromise be the result of wallet theft, we&rsquo;ll help you expedite the recovery of all your documents from IDs to credit and debit cards. Just one more way we&rsquo;re helping you have the peace of mind you deserve.</p><p>  </p>",

At her age she is not even thinking about retirement and goes to work every day her health permits. She used to tell people &ldquo;I want to be useful, not just ornamental.&rdquo;  Now she says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to be beautiful, I may as well be useful.&rdquo; What a woman!</p><h3> My mom has had a huge influence on my life and the person I have become.</h3><p> <br/> I thank God for her every day and let her know I&rsquo;m thinking about her with a daily phone call to let her know. She told someone the other day that she was worried about and hoped I was okay because she hadn&rsquo;t heard from me in the past couple of days. Bless her heart!</p><p> My mother is one of the most generous, caring, compassionate, accepting, loving people I ever met. I feel blessed to be her son and she encourages me to be a blessing to others. Her wise words have taught me many lessons along the way. It is my privilege to be able to share a few of those lessons with you.</p><li> <strong>  Be grateful. </strong> &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been better but I could be worse.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Be hospitable. </strong> &ndash; &ldquo;All of our company brings us pleasure.

Marketing Eric works on the foundation that <strong>  anyone can be a great marketer and that any organisation can create an effective marketing strategy to grow sales and amplify brand values. </strong> Many organisations suffer from a  <u>  lack of knowledge sharing </u>  and this shortcoming is often prevalent within digital marketing operations. Marketing Eric supports a transparent approach regarding  <u>  marketing activity in the workplace </u> .</p><p> <strong>  The landing page </strong></p><p> Landing pages are among the greatest misconceptions of the marketing industry. Put simply, their function is to assist in the conversion of prospect to lead and lead to client. Landing pages achieve this with the offer of a proposition to  <u>  nurture the lead through the sale&rsquo;s cycle </u>  and convert to business.</p><p> <strong>  The landing page offer </strong></p><p> The landing page proposition should focus on a single offer with a clear outcome. Offers should vary dependent on what you are looking to achieve from the page. Top of the funnel offers such as webinars, open-registration events and resources focus on attracting a prospect to your page and offering something in exchange for their contact information. Middle of the funnel offers are often lead nurture propositions to warm the lead and encourage their journey through the sale&rsquo;s cycle, an invitation to a networking event would be an example of this type of offer. Bottom of the funnel offers attempt to convert the lead into business. These offers will be attractive to a nurtured lead who has interacted with your company in the past. A demonstration or invite to an exclusive event would be an example of a bottom of the funnel offer.</p><p> <strong>  The landing page design </strong></p><p> Landing page design is most effective with a clear 'call to action' (CTA). The call to action of a landing page will generally be an offer, as outlined in the 'landing page offer' section above. Emphasis on the offer and what the user must do to receive said offer should form the focal point of the page. Some brands choose to apply graphics to their landing page design, images are not detrimental to conversion success unless they detract from the proposition. A form to capture the required information is essential. Forms vary in detail, from a simple email holding page to a detailed &lsquo;contact us&rsquo; style enquiry. Some  <u>  marketing automation platforms offer &lsquo;smart form&rsquo; functionality </u>  for marketing intelligence. These forms will use the visitor&rsquo;s cookie information to pre-populate any fields that have been completed on previous visits to the site. A clear CTA button to forward the user&rsquo;s information and navigate their progress through the cycle is also required; these buttons are often of a distinctive design or shade. The key to landing page success is a strong proposition, clear CTA button and accessible form.</p><p> <strong>  Landing page completion </strong></p><p> It is best practice to follow the landing page CTA or &lsquo;submit&rsquo; button with a thank you page. This page functions as a click-through and provides additional opportunity to further encourage your lead through the sale&rsquo;s funnel. Use this page to advertise social media channels and promote sharing of content. If your landing page has additional steps, inform your lead at this stage to encourage their compliance.</p><p> <strong>  Workflow to nurture landing page submissions </strong></p><p> If your marketing tool allows, it is advisable to enter all landing page submissions into an automated workflow. Send an email automatically to promote engagement between lead and brand. This is particularly important if the form completed was regarding the services of your organization. Use this process to nurture your submissions for free resources; provide a downloadable PDF via email, promote social sharing and suggest similar resources. These tools are invaluable at nurturing your leads with minimal resource from the marketing team.</p><p> <strong>  Marketing landing pages are used for an array of marketing offers from prospect to client. </strong> For each proposition, think of an effective operation to promote each offer with maximum clarity. Ultimately, how does the landing page encourage conversions?</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of my favorite leadership stories involves General Dwight D. Eisenhower during World War II. Eisenhower tried to schedule his days as the Supreme Commander so that he could spend the mornings in meetings and around his headquarters dealing with the challenges of the largest military undertaking in the history of the world. But he would then free up his schedule in the afternoons so that he could visit as many of the units that were under his command as was possible. <strong>  The brilliance of his leadership can be perceived from the following anecdote. </strong></p><p> Eisenhower was a man of his times, and as such he was a smoker, as were many of the soldiers in his command (cigarettes were issued to troops on a regular basis in those days.) A practice that Eisenhower undertook at the time was to not bring any cigarettes with him as he would go about and talk to the troops. This created a challenge for him that he would solve by bumming cigarettes off of the soldiers. This did two things for the soldiers; 1) the soldiers realized that General Eisenhower was human and they were more than happy to be the man that gave the Commanding General a cigarette, and 2) they would then later share this story with other soldiers and friends and families in letters, building the reputation of the General as a leader that was liked and respected by the troops.</p><p> <strong>  General Eisenhower received something far more valuable than the cigarettes, and that was feedback from the troops. </strong> While they were talking with Eisenhower the soldiers would willingly share their perspective of the war. Were they getting the proper equipment and clothing? Was the morale of the soldiers high and were they ready for the upcoming travails they were going to face? What Eisenhower was doing was keeping his finger on the pulse of his organization and learning from those on the ground what was working and what was not working &ndash; a great example of  <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.croftandcompany.com/need-leaders-flow/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LeadershipFlow  </a> </strong>  in action from a great leader.</p><p> As you read this, what are your thoughts on General Eisenhower&rsquo;s leadership and this anecdote?

    "title": "Guidelines for Building Trust in the Workplace",
    "link": "guidelines-for-building-trust-in-the-workplace",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Communication is one of the toughest subjects to deal with in the workplace. </strong> There are many ways in which we can sabotage the conversation, even if we don&rsquo;t intend to. Most of us are not taught how to do it effectively, and we end up with uncomfortable, incoherent and ineffective dialogues that harm relationships and destroy business.</p><p> The one critical skill that is rarely taught, and not many people know how to do effectively, is the art of listening. Listening builds trust and loyalty.</p><p> <strong>  Leaders who listen are held in higher esteem than those who don&rsquo;t. </strong> Employees or team members feel seen and heard, and are more likely to trust and respect the individual who listens to them, thus increasing loyalty, productivity, and collaboration.</p><p> To be listened to means another person is totally with you, leaning in, and interested in what you have to say. They are eager to empathize and make you feel understood. When you are with a good listener you feel safer, and more secure, and you open up to trust them more.</p><p> <strong>  Listening is not something we&rsquo;re naturally good at. </strong> My kids would try to get my attention when I was busy. &ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; they would say, several times, until they cottoned onto the fact that if they said &ldquo;Jacqueline,&rdquo; I would respond immediately. I heard them. In everyday listening, we space out. We hear the words but we&rsquo;re not responding to them clearly.</p><p> The truth is, those who have developed the art of listening are far more adept at navigating the increasingly diverse and multi-generational workplace. As a good listener, you are generally considered more thoughtful and compassionate. Good listeners are the people who make you feel you matter. They may disagree with you, but they have given you the time to express yourself, and given some thought to what you said.</p><p> Too many times people feel under-appreciated because their boss never takes the time to check in and see how they are feeling, or if they need something. People want to feel cared for, and when they are listened to with intent, it increases their well being during challenging times.</p><p> <strong>  There are several levels to listening. </strong></p><li> I&rsquo;m listening to you, but the focus is on what you said, and what I&rsquo;m going to say next. There is also a tendency to jump to conclusions before all the information is present and that can end in judgment or an opinion that wasn&rsquo;t asked for.</li><li> I&rsquo;m listening to you, and want to be sure I hear everything you are saying so I can clarify and give you the right response that is informed and give you what you need.</li><li> I&rsquo;m listening to you, and I&rsquo;m also listening to what you&rsquo;re not saying so I can give you deeper insight into the situation.</li><p> <br/> <strong>  Listening is not just what you&rsquo;re hearing, and how you&rsquo;re engaging in the conversation, but how you are present to the listener. </strong></p><p> Physical listening is leaning in, making eye contact, using hand gestures, and when appropriate, using touch to show you care.</p><p> <strong>  As a leader you are being watched. </strong> Every move, every gesture makes an impression on others. If they feel like you&rsquo;re distracted, cold or abrupt, you will lose their trust. If you are dismissive, rude or patronizing, they will take their loyalty elsewhere.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the small details that make or break a situation. Don&rsquo;t interrupt, finish sentences, or blurt out ideas before the speaker has finished speaking. With every interruption comes the opportunity to disengage, to switch off and disconnect from the main event. People respect people who listen because they know how hard it is to listen carefully, and considerately. Stay focused on what someone is saying and quiet the part of your brain that wants to speed things up, clarify or is bored by the conversation. We have all been there, and it&rsquo;s hard to keep our mouths shut!</p><p> <strong>  Listening is about staying in the moment. </strong> It is about remaining present to the speaker, and to allowing the space for real communication to occur. Listening is not future-oriented, even if your thoughts are.</p><p> <strong>  Some statistics you may want to ponder: </strong></p><li> 85% of what we know we have learned by listening. That&rsquo;s why audio books are so popular.</li><li> Humans generally only remember 25-50% of what we hear. Which means we miss an awful lot of information.</li><li> In a typical business day we spend 45% of our time listening, 30% talking, 16% reading, and 9% writing. Learn how to listen better.</li><li> Less than 2% of all professionals have had formal education or learning to understand and improve listening skills and techniques. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Guidelines to Build Trust </strong></p><li> Increase your awareness of others to open meaningful dialogue.</li><li> Create a listening space where there are no distractions that get in the way of listening with intent.</li><li> Eliminate interruptions. Be fully present to the individual you are speaking to.</li><li> Establish rapport by increasing you empathy for the individual.</li><li> Set aside assumptions and analysis. Stay out of judgment or blame until you hear all the facts.</li><li> Monitor your body language. Are you relaxed and open.</li><li> Listen for what&rsquo;s not said. Ask clarifying questions and repeat back to the listener so he or she understands what was said.</li><li> Ask for feedback. You may think you&rsquo;re doing a good job of listening, but you won&rsquo;t know unless you ask. <br/>  </li><p> Learn how to listen, and you will lead more effectively by showing you are committed to the growth of the individual you are speaking with.</p>",

    "title": "Clients Need Solutions, Not Features and Benefits",
    "link": "clients-need-solutions-not-features-and-benefits",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Pushing products and services doesn't work well. Talking about features and benefits won't get you far with today's customers, because they have such easy access to information about the features and benefits of the products and services they're interested in. But customers still have goals that they are trying to accomplish and they still need solutions to help them achieve these and overcome obstacles. You can't sell them a solution until you know what their business issues are, the problems they have in achieving their goals and other obstacles that they face.  <br/> <br/> An effective sales professional thoroughly researches potential clients before ever making contact, and also makes it a point to learn about the problems that the potential client seeks to solve. While a simple problem-solution paradigm makes sense, and is part of what goes into effective selling today, it is no longer the entire process.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Solutions Aren't Everything  </strong> <br/> <br/> Offering a solution isn't what's going to make the sale for you. We live in the information era, and anyone can easily research their problem and find solutions for it, no matter how unusual or specialized. In fact, your customers are  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/07/the-end-of-solution-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   often way ahead of the sales professionals  </a> </u>  trying to help them with solutions, because they've taken the time to understand their problem and evaluate potential solutions to it.  <br/> <br/> Sure, the ideal is to engage customers before they fully understand the scope of their needs, but even when you are able to do that, you still have to do something more: demonstrate to the potential customer the value of the solution you offer.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Value is the Differentiator; Sales Skills Must Address This  </strong> <br/> <br/> Once a customer knows that they have a need, he probably also has a good idea of what solutions are available and what they offer. After all, there really is an app for just about everything, and there are products arriving on the market every day promising to meet needs we may not have known we had.  <br/> <br/> The value that your product offers is what differentiates it as a solution from your competitors' solutions. Value may be represented in many different ways. Your solution may be more cost-effective. It may be the most convenient. It may free the customer up to focus on things that are more important. And it's up to you to show your customer how your solution provides value on top of simply solving the problem.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Learning What Represents Value to the Customer  </strong> <br/> <br/> Of course, to provide value, you have to learn what it means to your customer. The pre-call planning and research you do lays the groundwork for you, but you also have to learn to ask the right questions and really listen to the answers so you'll know how they define value in their particular situation. The effective value proposition focuses closely on what the customer really wants and values, whether that is to improve an existing solution, solve a specific problem, work more efficiently, or attract more business. Your customer's question, whether spoken or unspoken, is \"Why should I buy this product or service?\" Your answer is your compelling value proposition.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Plan, Discover, Reinforce Value  </strong> <br/> <br/> For each customer, you should complete a value analysis on your products or services. Before you place that sales call or go to that meeting with a potential customer, you must ask yourself what, based on your research, is of value to the customer. And you should make a plan to emphasize how your products and services address that value need. When you can quantify the value for your customer, you don't waste time, and you develop a strategy to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/course/handling-stalls-and-objections\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   minimize the importance of objections  </a> </u> . For example, if price may be an objection, your value proposition must demonstrate long term benefits in terms of the customer making more money or saving more money.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Conclusion  </strong> <br/> <br/> Sales skills today cannot ignore the customer's perception of value. Customers  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/blog/dont-tell-me-whats-in-it-for-you\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   aren't interested in what's in it for you  </a> </u> , but need to know what's in it for them. Ultimately, if the customer does not perceive the value of your products or services, then to him, the value doesn't exist and your product or service is not an ideal solution. Offering solutions and touting features and benefits is necessary, but it isn't everything. Creating a compelling value proposition for each customer is one of the most essential sales skills today.  <br/>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Insurance should never be sold in a vacuum. It should always be evaluated in terms of the broader, holistic picture of a client&rsquo;s financial plan. </strong> <br/> <br/> In the typical and traditional sense of selling insurance, an agent will often look at what someone qualifies for versus what they need. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Case Study: </strong> <br/> <br/> A married couple ages 49 and 52. The husband earns $350,000 a year, and the wife $200,000 a year. <br/> <br/> Determining what this couple qualifies for from a life insurance perspective is usually based off of income replacement: If the husband works the next 15 years making $350,000, his economic value would be $5.25 million. If the wife works another 10 years, her economic value would be $2 million. <br/> <br/> $5.25 million and $2 million are the human life value calculations. <br/> <br/> What these figures don't take into consideration are the actual needs of the clients. In this case, we have a family in a unique situation:</p><li> They have a special needs child who requires 24-hour care - a high cost.</li><li> They have $10 million in assets, which they are careful not to deplete in the interest of their child.</li><li> Their spending is low and manageable. <br/>  </li><p> If something were to happen to one spouse, spending is not the issue because their assets are adequate to offset the income loss. It is more important to make sure enough care will be provided for the child. . <br/> <br/> Our review concluded that the couple really only need about $1.3 million of coverage on each of them - a big difference from $5.25 million. This is why understanding the difference is so important and addressing insurance from the perspective of the client&rsquo;s planning is key. <br/> <br/> What is unique about the way that we work, and why we find ourselves to be different than traditional insurance agents, is we work with advisors to understand the financial backstory and the financial plan of their clients. From there, we make appropriate recommendations that make sense for their clients&rsquo; needs and budget. <br/> <br/> <strong>  How does your insurance process ensure that the recommendations for coverage match the financial plan of your clients? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> An executive who works alongside team members is rewarded with better performance but chumming up to employees is a fine balancing act. Too much comfort may breed complacency, an unwillingness to take on challenges, suppress independent thought and opposing ideas. You want your team to support and respect your decisions but you don&rsquo;t want anyone to become the head of your fan club. Here are ten ways to lead your team by example:</p><p> <strong>  1)  Walk alongside your team, not out in front  </strong></p><p> We often hear the term &ldquo;lead from out front.&rdquo; The most successful leaders walk alongside team members providing encouragement, support, and a good role model to follow.</p><p> <strong>  2)  Motivate your team around a common set of values  </strong></p><p> Leaders are human and mess up from time to time. Ensure the team&rsquo;s goals are value driven so that during any blunder, the group will be propelled forward by shared values.</p><p> <strong>  3)  Sweat it out with the team  </strong></p><p> When a big project involves extra hours, work alongside your team and be the first to offer gratitude. Surprise your team by passing out water bottles and healthy snacks.</p><p> <strong>  4)  Be humble </strong></p><p> Avoid gloating if you have just closed the sale of the year. Instead, share your process for closing the sale.  Brainstorm with your team on how you could have been more effective at overcoming an obstacle you faced during negotiations.</p><p> <strong>  5)  Do not be afraid to ask for advice or take direction  </strong></p><p> The next time you make a presentation at a conference, collaborate with your team to identify &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; to share and what they consider the most important talking points. Show them your vulnerability and be the student by valuing their contributions; this builds trust and credibility.</p><p> <strong>  6)  Empathy, empathy, and more empathy </strong></p><p> Your top advisor is falling behind for the second month in a row.  Can the motivation speech.  Empathize and engage in a meaningful discussion about how the economy is creating challenges for other advisors and work together to find helpful solutions.</p><p> <strong>  7)  Empower others to be part of the solution </strong></p><p> Encourage advisors to develop creative solutions to help other team members who are facing day-to-day challenges.</p><p> <strong>  8)  Make thinking transparent </strong></p><p> Post your sales goals mind map in a central location. If everyone understands the thinking behind the process, it is easier to reach goals.</p><p> <strong>  9)  Get your hands dirty </strong></p><p> Go out into the community and try a new sales strategy.  Be the first to report failures and ask for suggestions on how to improve the new sales approach.</p><p> <strong>  Taken together, these steps can engender loyalty and respect in a leader. </strong> Walking alongside and collaborating with your team members about what is needed provokes a &lsquo;we&rsquo; attitude.  Show you trust them, share areas for improvement, applaud successes, and display your confidence in them. <strong>  These components foster a sense of commitment, making it harder for individuals to abandon their managers and sales goals. </strong></p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Early in the second year of owning my own company, I traveled out of state to attend an awards event for the sole purpose of networking. Glammed up in an amazing white satin gown, I put on my game face, and bravely entered Atlanta&rsquo;s swanky Fox Theatre.</p><p> Alone.</p><p> <strong>  Bob Goff </strong> , author of the amazing book  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Love-Does-Discover-Secretly-Incredible/dp/1400203759/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427036156&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Love+Does\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Love Does  </u> </a> , was giving the keynote speech. I&rsquo;d read his book twice straight through, and I wanted to meet Bob so badly that I was willing to travel and attend this gala in order to do so.</p><p> Most of all, I wanted to tell him about a passion project of mine &mdash; preserving the stories of aging humanitarian heroes from the 1940s-1970s through film.</p><p> The evening went okay, as formal events go. Without a +1, I was seated at a table all the way in the back, with several young interns who giggled and chatted together. It&rsquo;s challenging to break into a crowd when you have no previous contacts and no wingman.</p><p> After his keynote speech, Bob Goff began mingling and I made a beeline toward the queue of people who were equally eager to make his acquaintance.</p><p> When my turn came, he shook my hand and cheerfully asked me about myself. Knowing I had only a few moments, I opened by mentioning a mutual friend, then launched directly into my pitch.</p><p> He listened politely, and then asked: &ldquo;So what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that. </strong> <br/> And obviously I didn&rsquo;t cover my confusion very well.</p><p> He clarified his question again: <strong>  &ldquo;Sounds like a great project. What exactly do you want from me?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> And that&rsquo;s where my pitch imploded on itself. I had no idea what exact single action or response I wanted from Bob Goff. I&rsquo;d thoroughly rehearsed my passion, my project, my purpose &mdash; but I&rsquo;d never fully articulated my proposal.</p><p> I stumbled through a few sentences on how I have the crew and the stories and the experience but not the budget. But it was obvious I&rsquo;d lost his interest. I thanked him for his time, shook hands, and slunk away.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=An+effective+pitch+needs+plan%2Bpractice%2C+so+you+can+execute+it+when+you%E2%80%99re+starstruck.&amp;via=sarahKasaftei&amp;related=sarahKasaftei&amp;url=http://sarahkasaftei.net/know-your-pitch/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   An effective pitch needs plan+practice, so you can execute it when you&rsquo;re starstruck.  </a> </u></p><p> Just thinking about that night makes me cringe a bit inside. The moment I got to meet Bob Goff and totally screwed up. It was far from the confident, collected impression I&rsquo;d wanted to make.</p><p> <strong>  An effective pitch needs to be planned (and practiced!) all the way through </strong> , so you can execute it on the spot, whether or not you&rsquo;re out of your element, whether or not you&rsquo;re starstruck.</p><p> Looking back, I should have said something like:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you asked, Bob! Because of your own humanitarian work, I know this is a passion you share in a big way, and I&rsquo;d like to talk with you more about it. Would you meet me for an early breakfast tomorrow before you leave town, so I can explain our vision?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> The next morning, after sharing more details about the mission, purpose and business plan of my project, I&rsquo;d have said something like:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I have followed your work in Uganda and I know there are people in your network who share this passion too. I want you to partner with us to inspire a new generation of young people to live for the betterment of others. And I&rsquo;d like you to connect me with people in your network who have a passion to give back by funding this project, so they can also be partners in educating young people about real life heroes who served under extraordinary circumstances to make the world a better place. </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Would you consider being an ambassador for our project?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> And then I should have sat back, shut up, and waited for him to answer.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=When+you+finish+your+pitch%2C+sit+back%2C+shut+up%2C+%26amp%3B+wait+for+an+answer.+%23pitchbetter&amp;via=sarahKasaftei&amp;related=sarahKasaftei&amp;url=http://sarahkasaftei.net/know-your-pitch/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   When you finish your pitch, sit back, shut up, &amp; wait for an answer. #pitchbetter  </a> </u></p><p> But I didn&rsquo;t. Instead, my story imploded on itself. Because I wasn&rsquo;t fully prepared. And even more so, because I was afraid.</p><p> I feared the risk of going all out and making my big ask. I was terrified he might say no, and so I let the opportunity crash at my feet.</p><p> When you have a chance to meet someone who could make an impact on your project and you can take the time to plan ahead, do your research.</p><p> <strong>  Research what their expertise can bring, so you tap into their passion as well.  </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Next+time+you+pitch%2C+make+sure+to+know+your+PASSION%2B+PROJECT%2B+PURPOSE%2B+PROPOSAL.+%23pitchbetter&amp;via=sarahKasaftei&amp;related=sarahKasaftei&amp;url=http://sarahkasaftei.net/know-your-pitch/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Next time you pitch, make sure to know your PASSION+ PROJECT+ PURPOSE+ PROPOSAL. #pitchbetter  </a> </u></p><p> Until you get that next amazing chance, take some time to review your pitch and make sure all four P&rsquo;s are ready to go.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobwillia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bob Williams  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Knowing each member&rsquo;s role in a talent&rsquo;s team greatly increases the chance your offer will be accepted. </strong></p><p> When deciding which celebrity to hire for a marketing campaign, it is important to remember that you are not just solely dealing with the celebrity. Talent comes with a team of various people that ensure the best deals, treatment, and representation. Celebrities rarely travel alone and will likely bring a member of their team such as an agent, publicist or manager during campaign related activities. These people handle various business and personal needs, and are often referred to as a celebrity&rsquo;s &ldquo;entourage.&rdquo;</p><p> Before a celebrity arrives to campaign related events, it is important to know the role of each member on a celebrity team &ndash;</p><p> <strong>  Agent:  </strong> Commonly referred to as a talent or booking agent, this person finds jobs and handles the career for the celebrity that has employed them. It&rsquo;s likely that marketers will deal with agents when attempting to recruit talent for campaigns or endorsements. Agents help their clients get auditions, communicate with casting directors, work on contracts so their client gets the best deal and arrangements, etc. Various types of public figures have agents such as actors, authors, directors, musicians, models, professional athletes, and even screenwriters.</p><p> <strong>  Publicist: </strong>  A publicist&rsquo;s job is to handle their client&rsquo;s relationship with the media, and help generate and manage publicity. Publicist&rsquo;s tasks include arranging interviews and public appearances, handling press releases, organizing social media accounts, and advising on how to handle bad publicity. Unlike agents and managers, publicists often work for a flat fee instead of a percentage of the talent&rsquo;s income.</p><p> <strong>  Attorney:  </strong> Most of the work of an entertainment attorney involves drafting contracts, negotiation, and mediation. These attorneys cover various areas including media, and legal fields such as corporate, finance, intellectual property, and privacy. Entertainment attorneys work with agents to finalize contracts for various projects, including compensation and participation. Some attorney&rsquo;s job descriptions have become comparable to those of a star&rsquo;s agent, manager or publicist; they are not limited to paperwork, but assist in building their client&rsquo;s career.</p><p> <strong>  Manager:  </strong> Celebrity managers wear a variety of hats in their job, and have the ability to act as agents, publicists, contract negotiators, etc. Their responsibilities and duties can vary widely on a day to day basis. Managers help celebrities create daily schedules, create long-term career goals, give financial advice, and help to hire other members of a celebrity&rsquo;s team. They are often the closest team member to a celebrity, which is why many enlist their parents or other family members to serve in this role.</p><p> <strong>  Stylists:  </strong> Stylists, or a celebrity&rsquo;s &ldquo;glam squad,&rdquo; is a crucial part of their entourage. During filming and other campaign activities, celebrities can require their personal hair stylists, makeup artists, and wardrobe team to attend various events. Celebrity stylists can often times be costly, and have their own individual representation teams.</p><p> <strong>  Label and/or publisher (if dealing with music): </strong>  A label or publisher is the person or company that handles the issuing of music, images, books, or other works for sale and use in the entertainment industry. If marketers are looking to use a song in their campaign instead of a celebrity, they would go through the label or publisher that has the rights to said song.</p>",

It was commissioned and part-funded by Ember Television, but we kept our distance from the research process. There has been very little independent research on marketing for advisory firms, and we were as keen as anyone to know the state of play.</p><p> Asked which form of marketing they considered the most effective, more than half of those surveyed went for content. <strong>  Events and seminars were rated the next most effective, ahead of printed materials and press releases. </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/effective-marketing-financial-planners.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> <strong>  I must say I was surprised to see   <u>   <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/video-content-and-social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    social media   </a>  </u>   at the bottom of the list. </strong> Financial planners have never been prolific users of Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, and now it seems that many of those who have used social media are scaling back.</p><p> For firms looking to grow - to attract and retain more clients - that is surely a mistake. <strong>  Social media is precisely where their clients and prospective clients are.

You can have the best content, but if not enough people in your target demographic see your insightful videos, your beautiful infographics or your word-perfect blog, you&rsquo;ve wasted precious time and resources.</p><p> <strong>  Social media is how you direct your content to the people who you want to see and engage with it. </strong>  It&rsquo;s also how you share other people&rsquo;s content - and that too is crucial to building a loyal audience.</p><p> Yes, it&rsquo;s time-consuming, and (not least for compliance reasons) it certainly isn&rsquo;t something you can leave to just anyone to manage on their own. As with blogging, my advice is that if you and your senior colleagues don&rsquo;t have time for social media, you should outsource it to someone with specialist knowledge and expertise.</p><p> So just as any well-balanced portfolio includes equities and bonds, <strong>  an effective marketing strategy needs both content and social media.  </strong></p><p> Read more about the research  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/blog/building-trust-with-clients-is-top-priority-for-financial-advisers-in-2015-study-shows/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in this blog  </a> </u> .

    "content": "<p> The Federal Reserve released the results of the &ldquo;DFAST&rdquo; stress tests two weeks ago, but one risk management firm, <strong>  Kamakura Corporation, thinks the market does a far better job predicting financial calamity than the stress tests. </strong> Kamakura, which is a consultant to the FDIC and U.S. Treasury that provides quantitative analysis of interest rate and credit risk, argues, &ldquo;The marketplace considers all scenarios, not just three as in the Fed&rsquo;s CCAR [Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review] stress tests.&rdquo;</p><p> Kamakura analyzed trading activity taking place on the Monday following the release of the stress test results and concluded that an analysis of market-based factors contributes a far deeper understanding of bank credit spreads than the results of the stress tests when assessing an institution&rsquo;s ability to honor its commitment to making timely interest and principal payments. Why? In Kamakura&rsquo;s words, <strong>  &ldquo;The marketplace invests cold hard cash to price various financial institutions&rsquo; promises to pay.&rdquo; </strong> Kamakura analyzed 27 of the 31 financial institutions required to submit stress test results, and attributed only a small percentage increase in variation of credit spread predictive power compared to a purely statistics-based model. A one percentage point increase in Basel III Tier 1 capital ratio, for example, explained around 5 basis points of credit spread variation, whereas their statistical model, crafted using public data exclusively, explained about 82% of credit spread variation.</p><p> <strong>  This matters for portfolio management because institutions that meet the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s stress test requirements </strong> , or &ldquo;pass,&rdquo; are somewhat validated via this very process for having superior credit quality, partly due to increased regulatory oversight. But the market disagrees. Kamakura, in another article, notes that 25 financial institutions, including Berkshire Hathaway and CME Group, have lower credit spreads than the best &ldquo;Too Big to Fail&rdquo; banks. Moreover, when Kamakura ranked bonds based on reward-to-risk ratio (an analogous approach to the concept of the Sharpe Ratio), some of the most heavily-regulated banks (including Citigroup and Bank of America) had bonds ranked near the bottom of the list (others offer compelling reward-to-risk ratios, but did not trade in sufficient quantities or at all on the day Kamakura did its analysis).</p><p> At SNW, we apply an approach similar to Kamakura&rsquo;s by leveraging quantitative metrics that rely on equity trading data and factors specific to the bond market, like leverage and interest coverage, for determining relative value. Using this approach, portfolio holdings like Aflac and NASDAQ consistently rank higher than financial alternatives that are subject to substantial regulatory oversight. We factor in the DFAST stress test results, but apply a sizable haircut to their incremental ability to predict variations in credit spreads over and above the marketplace.</p><p> Sources: Kamakura Corporation, Federal Reserve, SNWAM Research</p>",

    "title": "What Does Integrated Marketing Really Mean?",
    "link": "what-does-integrated-marketing-really-mean",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoCommPR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Danielle Cyr  </a> </u></p><p> You&rsquo;ve likely heard the term integrated marketing. But, what does it really mean? More importantly, what does integrated marketing mean for your company? Or, your cause? In this post, we&rsquo;ll break down the basics of integrated marketing and help determine if this approach is the right communications strategy to help you generate optimal ROI.</p><p> <strong>  Integrated marketing is&hellip;multi-channel </strong> <br/> Integrated is about more than blending traditional and social. It&rsquo;s about creating a custom blend of internal and external communications, community relations and investor relations, and the list goes on. The goal of an integrated marketing strategy is to lay the foundation for a proactive marketing communications program that ensures all tactics are working together to achieve a common set of goals and objectives.</p><p> Effective integrated marketing programs are built on a common set of message points and keep all target audiences top-of-mind. This synergistic approach ensures companies and causes aren&rsquo;t competing with themselves for audiences&rsquo; attention and that audiences gain a comprehensive understanding of an organization&rsquo;s depth and breadth.</p><p> So which marketing communications channels comprise a company or cause&rsquo;s integrated marketing toolkit? Tradeshow marketing, social media marketing, public relations (including media relations and community relations), direct mail, search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM), advertising and inbound marketing, to name a few. Again, each company or cause should have a &lsquo;custom blend&rsquo; that is best suited to achieving their objectives.</p><p> <strong>  Integrated marketing is&hellip;cohesive </strong> <br/> Needing to communicate with different target audiences through different channels can often make maintaining consistency a challenge. As we discussed under the umbrella of multi-channel, integrated marketing programs help companies to effectively communicate about all of their programs and services to all of their audiences without competing with themselves for market share and/or attention. By developing a multi-channel program that bridges various channels, mediums and audiences, companies and causes are able to optimize their marketing resources while maximizing ROI.</p><p> As a result of this integrated approach, companies and causes alike have more, highly- targeted content to work with and are able to be more effective in driving the right traffic to their content. Examples of this include, but are not limited to:</p><li> Blog posts that recap tradeshow speaking engagements;</li><li> &lsquo;Live&rsquo; tweeting from conferences and company/cause-hosted events;</li><li> Using website case studies as hard-copy sell sheets; and,</li><li> Recapping takeaways from conferences and professional development seminars via blogs. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Integrated marketing is&hellip;multi-department </strong> <br/> The emergence of inbound marketing (also known as content marketing) solidifies the importance of having sales and marketing on the same page, working to achieve common business goals. The benefit of a multi-department program is that knowledge is shared across the company, ensuring everything from marketing collateral to sales presentations are on-brand and tailored to the end user&rsquo;s needs.</p><p> <strong>  What are the benefits of integrated marketing? </strong> <br/> In many instances, an integrated approach makes it easier to prove marketing ROI. This is the result of a strategic approach that focuses on measurable outcomes, be it increased revenue, donations, etc. Further, aligning sales and marketing teams in support of common goals and objectives reduces redundancies and ensures consistency of messaging between departments and job functions.</p><p> <strong>  How does one take their traditional and/or social marketing and transition to an integrated approach? </strong> <br/> Rest assured, we aren&rsquo;t advocating for throwing the baby out with the bath water. We&rsquo;re simply suggesting that recalibrating can help to achieve better results.</p><p> Before implementing an integrated marketing strategy, it&rsquo;s advisable to audit your current marketing activities to determine what has historically worked well and what strategies and tactics have under-performed. Going through a marketing audit will help ensure your integrated marketing strategy focuses on the audiences and channels that have the greatest potential to positively impact the bottom line. Once you&rsquo;ve audited your current marketing activities, you&rsquo;re ready to step back, align your marketing plan with your overall business/nonprofit plan and begin creating synergy between your online and offline, marketing and sales activities.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://beyondphilosophy.com/author/colin-shaw/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Colin Shaw  </a> </u></p><p> Everyone makes mistakes. You charged for the wrong plan on a Customer&rsquo;s mobile bill or sent an &lsquo;Extra Small&rsquo; instead of a Medium on the Jacket a Customer ordered online. More serious mistakes could be that as a Doctor, you misdiagnosed a life threatening condition that results in serious consequences for your patient and his or her loved ones. We all make mistakes. What should you do when this happens?</p><p> When you make a mistake, it&rsquo;s best to admit it and apologize immediately.</p><p> The 6 Steps to a Good Apology</p><p> So how do you recover from a mistake with your customers? The answer is best summarized in an article I read by Kerry O&rsquo;Malley, called, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketectsinc.com/the-right-way-to-admit-you-made-a-mistake-in-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Right Way to Admit You Made a Mistake in Business.  </a> </u> &rdquo; She gives us all a great list that includes:</p><li> <strong>  Act quickly.  </strong> Sooner is always better than later.</li><li> <strong>  Apologize in person. </strong>  It means more when you are physically present.</li><li> <strong>  Explain what happened. </strong> Give them the facts of the situation and avoid blame.</li><li> <strong>  Show how you are going to avoid the problem in the future. </strong>  Mistakes are nothing if not opportunities in disguise.</li><li> <strong>  Apologize. </strong> Use the actual words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Make restitution.  </strong> If possible and appropriate, so what you can do to make it right. Be careful here, however, because sometime you can unwittingly do too much to compensate, which can <a href=\"http://www.beyondphilosophy.com/blog/when-does-customer-service-experience-recovery-become-overkill\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   undermine future loyalty  </u> </a> . <br/>  </li><p> The only other addition I might add to the list is for you to express how you feel about the mistake. Acknowledging your emotions is key to communicating with your customer. By being honest about how you feel about the mistake, you create a personal relationship that contributes to the Customer&rsquo;s feelings of being important and &ldquo;cared for.&rdquo; The only time I would caution against this tactic is if you don&rsquo;t feel like you are to blame and are have bitter feelings about the situation. As I have <a href=\"http://www.beyondphilosophy.com/blog/apologizing-way-promotes-customer-loyalty\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   written before  </u> </a> , these feelings will make the apology seem insincere and will lead to nothing good.</p><p> The strategy above works great for most businesses to business and business to customer relationships. It&rsquo;s honest; it&rsquo;s proactive, and it&rsquo;s the best you can do in the situation. Most of all, it offers an opportunity for your customer to decide what to do and strengthens the relationship between you&hellip;most of the time anyway.</p><p> <strong>  Why it&rsquo;s Important to Apologize Even When it&rsquo;s Difficult </strong></p><p> The act of apologizing is difficult for some people because it makes them feel vulnerable. Feeling open can be scary and can drive some people to hide from the situation, avoiding the customer or client to avoid the feelings of vulnerability. While avoidance might or might not result in bad consequences for a business relationship (although I am certain that it will only be bad), it can have terrible repercussions on a medical career.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/814876_4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Medscape.com </a>  had an excellent article on why some patients don&rsquo;t sue their doctors, even when they have a good case. To summarize the article, patients who sue are the ones where the doctor avoids them, denying them both an explanation and assurance that the problem will get fixed for the future. As you read before, these are both important parts of an apology in the above list. According to the article, many patients pursue litigation when denied these answers. Their goal, in many cases, is to get these answers, not to punish the physician. In many cases, an honest conversation between the physician and the patient or their family results in them not filing a lawsuit against the doctor to blame.</p><p> What is true no matter what the mistake and what the consequences, is that all of us realize that people all make mistakes. No one likes the consequences of their mistakes. No one relishes the thought of calling the client they have let down or the customer that is rightfully frustrated and explain that they are the one that is responsible. I can&rsquo;t even imagine how a surgeon or doctor must feel when they realize their mistake resulted in a patient&rsquo;s death.</p><p> <strong>  Being proactive, however, with honesty is the best policy, no matter how distasteful it is. </strong> Most people can forgive a person for making a mistake. Few people, however, can forgive a person from blaming others, denying responsibility or covering up their errors. These actions create an emotional response that will not drive value for anyone concerned and will destroy trust in the Customer relationship.</p><p> <strong>  Elton John said, &ldquo;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word.&rdquo; </strong> In many ways, he is right. Difficult or not, it&rsquo;s the right word when you made a mistake, followed by the other words that apply to the list for a good apology. <strong>  Honesty is the best policy, and the only policy that gives you a chance for Customer retention. </strong></p>",

    "link": "using-twitter-to-get-c-level-appointments-a-case-study-socialselling",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog is about how a sales guy is using LinkedIn and Twitter to get C-Level Appointments.  People often say to me &ldquo;Social Media is for teenagers, give me an example of where people are using Social Media to create, real, tangible, business.&rdquo;  Here is that example.</p><p> Paul  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snapdragon_paul\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @snapdragon_paul  </a> </u>  contacted me over @Twitter, he lives close to me, so we agreed to have a coffee.  I was interested in his story on how he had saved &pound;70,000 on recruitment fees by using Cloud and Social Media. We got talking, and Paul talked through his sales career (story was very similar to mine) and then talked about how he was using Social in his current sales role.</p><p> What hooked me, was when he told me he had made 10 C-Level appointments in a week!  This blog will now share with you his secret.</p><p> <strong>  Sales &ndash; Starting at the Bottom! </strong></p><p> When Paul and I got our &ldquo;big breaks&rdquo; in sales we started from the bottom. Both of us had been given a Telephone Directories and told to &ldquo;call that&rdquo;.  There was no @LinkedIn, we didn&rsquo;t know what a Value Proposition was, we knew nothing about how to conduct ourselves on the telephone.</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s down to personality, but actually we were both pretty good at it. My view was, well I&rsquo;m probably never going to meet these people, so if I make a fool of myself, who cares?</p><p> <strong>  Cold Calling &ndash; Things have Changed </strong></p><p> Paul then expanded on how over the last 20 years making cold calls had got more difficult.  More voice mail, more gatekeepers employed to keep us sales people away from &ldquo;Decision Makers&rdquo;.  There are many Social Selling articles written that you don&rsquo;t need to make Cold calls anymore, I&rsquo;m not so sure about it, but it has got harder and harder.</p><p> <strong>  How Do you Book C-Level Meetings using Social Media? </strong></p><p> Paul started doing all the things I write about here from a Social Selling point of view.  He set yourself up with a buyer centric profile on LinkedIn and Twitter and started curating and posting articles that he thought would be interesting to his audience.  The day before we met, he had got a C-Level meeting purely from an Infographic on LinkedIn.  He showed me the dialogue on LinkedIn.  As simple as that, decent content on LinkedIn and Bam!  A Meeting.  Anyway back to how he gets 10 appointments a week.</p><p> As all good sales professionals do, he researches his target accounts (no different than we have done for the last 30 years) but this time he does this in the Social world of LinkedIn.  (Paul and I both recommend you pay the subscription and get access to the Sales Navigator.)  He researches the organisation, business issues, news items and Executives and then looks for the people from the target Account on Twitter.  Paul, follows all his target accounts and the C-Level people he has researched on Twitter.</p><p> His usual, approach to a C-Level contact is &ldquo;Noticed you were talking about XYZ have you considered this?&rdquo;  This, being some content that the contact will be interested in to drive the conversation forward.</p><p> He got a meeting with a C-Level Executive in the UK&rsquo;s Post Office.  There is a roll out of technology that this Executive has responsibility for.  Paul took a photo of this particular technology in his local Post Office and Tweeted to this individual &ldquo;Great to see this technology being rolled out&rdquo;, the Executive replied and they got into a dialogue.  Paul telling the Executive he had a presentation that might be of interest.  The executive then followed Paul back so they could have a Direct Message (DM) conversation.  Paul shared the presentation.</p><p> <strong>  Using Twitter Rooms &ndash; &ldquo;Tag&rdquo; Selling </strong></p><p> With some good research and a degree of luck, Paul usually gets a follow back and then enters into a (DM) Direct Message conversation.</p><p> As with many sales organisations, Paul is a sales &ldquo;generalist&rdquo; so once he is in a DM conversation he brings in a colleague with specialist domain experience.  He does this using Twitter rooms.  He always asks permission to bring in the colleague.  At the point the specialist is engaged, he closes for next action, which in his case is a meeting / appointment.  He calls this tactic &ldquo;shared Twitter Rooms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tag Selling&rdquo;.</p><p> Paul says he gets a far better response in Twitter room and says he never asks for the sale directly, by then there should be trust built between the two parties.</p><p> <strong>  Results so far &ndash; 10 C-Level Meetings per week. </strong></p><p> Now I agree that maybe your product or service isn&rsquo;t the same as Paul&rsquo;s but you have to admit that using Social this way is pretty impressive.</p><p> <strong>  There&rsquo;s One More Thing </strong></p><p> I asked Paul how he researched the contacts on Twitter and he said that standard Twitter functionality, where it suggests three additional people to connect to, Twitter often picks &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; contacts.</p><p> He described this as &ldquo;rolling out dough&rdquo;.  The three people that Twitter suggested were often of a similar quality.</p><p> NB: While recently talking about this article to @desalescoach he said a common objection from sales people, was you need thousands of followers to make this work.  At the time of writing  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snapdragon_paul\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @snapdragon_paul  </a> </u>  has 542.</p>",

    "content": "<p> So Facebook announced clarification of plans to rollout Facebook Pay, an easy way to pay friends through Facebook using your debit card.They had considered credit cards, but want to avoid fraud and risk and felt the debit card is the way to go.  Initially US-based, the service will gradually be released worldwide.  Here are the key points from Facebook&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/03/send-money-to-friends-in-messenger/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   own release  </a> </u> :Today we&rsquo;re adding a new feature in Messenger that gives people a more convenient and secure way to send or receive money between friends. This feature will be rolling out over the coming months in the US.It&rsquo;s easy and free. <img alt=\"\" height=\"481\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6a01053620481c970b01b7c7664767970b-700wi.png\" width=\"700\"/> <strong>  To send money: </strong></p><li> Start a message with a friend</li><li> Tap the $ icon and enter the amount you want to send</li><li> Tap Pay in the top right and add your debit card to send money</li><strong> To receive money:</strong><li> Open the conversation from your friend</li><li> Tap Add Card in the message and add your debit card to accept money for the first time</li>The money you send is transferred right away. It may take one to three business days to make the money available to you depending on your bank, just as it does with other deposits.<strong> Secure Network</strong>A dependable and trusted payments processor for game players and advertisers since 2007, Facebook processes more than one million transactions daily on the site and also handles all the payments processed on Messenger.Incorporating security best practices into our payments business has always been a top priority. We use secure systems that encrypt the connection between you and Facebook as well as your card information when you ask us to store it for you. We use layers of software and hardware protection that meet the highest industry standards. These payment systems are kept in a secured environment that is separate from other parts of the Facebook network and that receive additional monitoring and control. A team of anti-fraud specialists monitor for suspicious purchase activity to help keep accounts safe.The first time you send or receive money in Messenger, you&rsquo;ll need to <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1484510438478143\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  add a Visa or MasterCard debit card </a></u> issued by a US bank to your account. Once you add a debit card, you can <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1008730562474141\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  create a PIN </a></u> to provide additional security the next time you send money. On iOS devices you can also enable Touch ID. As always, you can <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/148233965247823\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  add another layer of authentication </a></u> to your account at any time.The new payments feature is rolling out in the coming months in the US across Android, iOS, and desktop.I did silently chuckle that this announcement came out on Tuesday following Monday&rsquo;s announcement of Facebook&rsquo;s rules related to <u> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/16/facebook-policy-nudity-hate-speech-standards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  nudity </a></u>.  After all, a social network doesn&rsquo;t want to be plagued with people using their debit cards to buy and sell sexual favours, do they? (you&rsquo;ve got <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/03/crime-as-a-service-pay-as-you-blow-with-bitcoin.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  bitcoin </a></u> for that)Anyways, is Facebook Pay any good?  Techcrunch gives a <u> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/facebook-pay/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  good analysis </a></u> of the technicalities of the service, and note that it&rsquo;s been built in spite of convenient alternatives like Stripe, Square and PayPal, Facebook&rsquo;s partner of choice for payments since 2008.  In response to the question of the split, PayPal said:We have had a great relationship with Facebook since 2008 and currently work closely together to deliver easy payments on a global scale for its games and ads businesses.  PayPal has always taken a partnership approach to payments and we will continue to work with Facebook and many other companies on new payments experiences that make it easier for people to send and receive money on both the PayPal and Braintree platforms.<strong> I bet.</strong>What intrigues me with Apple Pay and Facebook Pay is a different theme however, as we now have two big heavyweights in the world of technology weighing in on payments.  Their aim: make it easy, cheap and convenient to pay whilst engaged in entertainments, sharing and fun.Removing the friction of payments.   Isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;ve been saying banks should do?Regardless, the good news is that Apple and Facebook have deigned to allow banks to still play in the game of money online.  The bad news is that banks are now wrapped in a stranglehold by these major players, and Google and Amazon are still to play (not forgetting Yandex, Alibaba and co).The evidence of what this means is that banks are going to be squeezed on margin.  We&rsquo;ve already seen this with Apple forcing <a href=\"http://bankinnovation.net/2014/09/apple-said-to-negotiate-deep-payments-discounts-from-big-banks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  lower fees </u></a> per transaction from their bank wallet players, giving Apple a slice of margin off the top that equates to billions when you multiply 800+ million iTunes accounts making an average $3.2 in transactions per month (reference <u> <a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2013/06/14/whats-an-apple-user-worth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Asymco, 2013 </a></u>).Facebook&rsquo;s model will follow the same approach over time, I&rsquo;m sure, as banks don&rsquo;t want to lose the opportunity and threat of being included or excluded from these heavyweight players networks.  But it&rsquo;s not the banks I feel sorry for, but Visa and MasterCard.  Right now, the card companies have been very adept at pushing the envelope of innovation.  They&rsquo;ve been at the heart of contactless rollout, NFC and pushing the mobile wallet wars.  But what happens if an Apple or Facebook came out tomorrow and said that they&rsquo;re now going to be transaction rails to your bank?  Visa and MasterCard (and the rest) wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance.I&rsquo;m not saying they will do this, as it would involve too much negotiation with banks and such like of course, but there are those who think <u> they will</u> and those who think <u> <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/2879019/visa-mastercard-excited-by-apple-pay.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  they won&rsquo;t </a></u>.To be honest, it may not be in their interest to do anything but let&rsquo;s just say that one day they introduce a view that all of your payments will be taken monthly from your bank account, or any other preferred source, for a charge of $1.  In so doing, you get a 5% reduction in all your purchase costs.  The reduction is because there are no fees being taken by the card companies and retailers and banks have agreed a good deal with Apple to be in the loop.Just sayin&rsquo; &hellip; ",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  INTRODUCTION </strong></p><p> Some ideation is spontaneous. Other ideation results from focused effort.</p><p> For inventors and entrepreneurs who typically exist more as isolated &ldquo;human&rdquo; islands during the early stages of a future new venture, reliance is placed on their accumulated knowledge, skills, and past experiences.</p><p> Invention and innovation occur within large organizations (e.g., 3M, IBM, etc.) as a result of highly formalized processes that harness the collective abilities of their scientists and engineers.</p><p> Regardless of the source of invention and innovation, a process that helps to systematically enable consistent thought is valuable to those wishing to become an entrepreneur.</p><p> <strong>  A SUGGESTED PROCESS FOR IDEATION, INNOVATION, AND INVENTION </strong></p><p> No matter what a person&rsquo;s level of expertise is there are ways to diligently think about a problem or opportunity, starting with understanding the landscape and environment of the area of interest (AOI) to identify problem(s) and develop the vision.  An overview of an ideation process is provided in Figure 1 Of course, there may be many innovation processes&mdash;this is but one approach.</p><p> <strong>  STEP 1  <br/>  SELECT AN AREA OF INTEREST (AOI) </strong> <br/> The inventor or entrepreneur should be inspired and passionate about the AOI and have supportive knowledge and skills.</p><p> <strong>  STEP 2  <br/>  IDENTIFY UNSOLVED PROBLEM OR OPPORTUNITY </strong> <br/> Both primary and secondary research can be used to identify existing solutions and unsolved problems and opportunities for new products and services.</p><p> <strong>  STEP 3  <br/>  DEVELOP YOUR VISION </strong> <br/> Your vision drives the creative processes needed for innovation, invention, and intellectual property development.</p><p> <strong>  STEP 4  <br/>  RESEARCH &amp; DISCOVERY </strong> <br/> Existing technology, patents, products, and services must be diligently researched and understood with a view towards identifying what new technology, innovations, and inventions need to be developed.</p><p> <strong>  STEP 5  <br/>  INNOVATION </strong> <br/> The &ldquo;eureka&rdquo; moment occurs when something new and useful is invented.</p><p> <strong>  STEP 6  <br/>  INVENTION </strong> <br/> The innovation or idea must be captured in the form of an invention and initial patent positions and trade secrets established.</p><p> Problem or opportunity discovery is facilitated through primary research in which information and data are acquired directly from other parties in discussions at technical conferences, interviews with technical experts, and informally in a variety of settings in which conversations with others may occur. Of course, the point of this research is to collect useful information from others and not to disclose information about what you, the inventor, may be thinking. Thus, information flow is strictly one-way. Secondary research&mdash;information collected from public documents (including the Internet)&mdash;is also useful and necessary to provide as complete a view of the landscape as possible. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The processes of creating ideas (e.g., ideation)&mdash;and yes, there are processes&mdash;start with a keen awareness of a target AOI and the environment </strong> , both of which are essential to achieving deeper insights. Critical questions must be asked and answered. What are the problems within the AOI? What would be achieved if a different solution were available? What are other companies delivering now? What would the world look like if X or Y could be achieved? In other words: &ldquo;What is your vision?&rdquo; <a href=\"///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Administrator/My%20Documents/Book/Social%20Media%20Communications/LinkedIn%20Post%20#19--%20Learn%20to%20ideate%20and%20innovate%20-%20Revised%20Figure%201.docx\">  [1] </a></p><p> Vision, in the context of entrepreneurship, is the ability to clearly see a future based on the implementation of an innovation. Vision includes naturally an appreciation for the impact on society if the new venture is successful. This vision is typically not necessarily easily shared, but it can eventually be shared among a founding team and, later, a new venture and the people within the funded company. This vision drives the entrepreneur to push forward with passion and purpose.</p><p> Necessarily, the inventor or entrepreneur becomes the &ldquo;vision holder,&rdquo; that person who is driven the most to succeed, persevere, and deliver the solution to society. Every company needs a vision holder, and the less developed the underlying new venture or company is, the more the will and desire of the vision holder needs to be at the forefront.</p><p> Vision drives the need to be creative, a necessary prerequisite to developing the underlying idea and innovation. Creativity is achieved often in seemingly random ways, but it can be also be brought forth or encouraged through research and discovery. Sometimes, the idea does not immediately have an identifiable product and market, in which case additional thought must be devoted to the idea and its applications. Ideally, the idea results in innovation and an invention for which a product and target market is readily identifiable.</p><p> Naturally, inventors and entrepreneurs hope to achieve that &ldquo;eureka&rdquo; moment, when it is realized that an innovation has been discovered&mdash;an innovation that has, at first glance, not been invented or disclosed elsewhere. At that point, it is critical that the innovation be preserved in the form of an immediate provisional patent application (followed by a regular patent application within a year).</p><p> That&rsquo;s it&mdash;I have personally used this process and found it to be very useful.  Hopefully, it will be for you also.</p>",

    "link": "money-cant-buy-my-engagement-into-your-culture",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I was having a conversation the other day with a friend and the discussion of engagement, engagement surveys, and culture came into the mix. My friend was telling me high-level the results of their recent employee engagement survey and that employees had indicated they did not feel they could share or were tied to the success of the organization. As a result, the company immediately began looking into giving select employee levels the opportunity to now be in the organization&rsquo;s bonus program.</p><p> My initial thought when I heard this was &ldquo;are you kidding me?&rdquo; Essentially it sounds like you are trying to buy people into the company&rsquo;s culture by now offering the opportunity to take part in an organizational bonus program. I asked a few questions to get a better understanding as to some of the specifics with this bonus program.</p><li> Were there other items being evaluated to determine if money was the resolve to have employees feel like they share the success of the organization?</li><li> Was the bonus program going to be tied to individual goals that influence employee behavior to increase performance?</li><li> Had anyone discussed with employees to understand what this meant to them?</li><li> Was this a short-term or long-term option &ndash; meaning, could the bonus program go away if the company didn&rsquo;t perform or they didn&rsquo;t seen any change on the next engagement survey? <br/>  </li><p> Most certainly I had more questions, but these were very top of mind for me. The answers my friend shared indicated employees essentially wanted to feel, see, or take part in the success of the organization, so the corporate leadership team determined a bonus that was tied into the overall success of the organization would get people bought into the culture. So if the business performed, they would get a part of the pie; if they business didn&rsquo;t perform, they may not get as much of the pie or any of it at all.</p><p> This methodology my friend described to me really dumbfounded me. Given where we are in the evolution of the modern workplace, I believe there has been enough research which clearly shows that just because you throw money at someone, doesn&rsquo;t mean you get buy-in. Especially to company culture.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Engagement+is+part+of+a+culture+and+culture+is+developed+as+a+whole%2C+not+by+one+individual.&amp;via=PerformanceIC&amp;related=PerformanceIC&amp;url=http://www.performanceicreate.com/money-cant-buy-my-engagement-into-your-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Engagement is part of a culture and culture is developed as a whole, not by one individual.  </a> </u></p><p> Therefore, if you are looking to really understand how to get employee to value, take ownership, and empower behavior and performance to drive organizational success, here are some tips to help you begin:</p><li> <strong>  Talk with your employees </strong> &ndash; there is nothing worse than trying to make decisions in a vacuum or without clarity of information; if you are faced with information where employees are stating they do not feel they can share or take part in the organization&rsquo;s success, ASK THEM what this means! What do they need to be able to share in the company&rsquo;s success?</li><li> <strong>  Money doesn&rsquo;t buy love </strong> &ndash; money is many times an easy thing to throw around because it is also the simplest reason for someone to give when they are leaving a company for another. Why? Because nine times out of ten, no one will question if you are leaving for more money. The thing you have to remember about money is it provides short-term results, not long-term results. Money doesn&rsquo;t keep people engaged.</li><li> <strong>  Cascade success down </strong> &ndash; in the instance of my friend, employees did not feel they shared the success of the organization. In these situations, if you create individual goals that are subsequently tied back to goals at the top, employees will more likely see the connection. Giving someone a target that is 10,000 feet high at the very top of the organization doesn&rsquo;t typically get anyone engaged or provide understanding how one person can influence it from the very bottom.</li><li> <strong>  Provide feedback </strong> &ndash; performance management is no good if you are not going to provide continuous feedback. Just like you want feedback from you manager, your employees want the same thing. When I speak with many managers, they tell me they do not have time to sit down and provide feedback, but the cool thing is feedback can be provided in short bursts of time. A five minute conversation here or there and you are achieving the greater goal in small chunks. Make time and opportunities work for you and the employee &ndash; it will pay off in the long run versus simply doing nothing at all.</li><li> <strong>  Recognize </strong> &ndash; recognize efforts!</li>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Nike. Coca-Cola. Oakley.    </strong> <br/> <br/> They are all top brands in the global marketplace and they have all led the charge towards mass customization and personalization. You can build a custom pair of Nike Free Run sneakers online, incorporating your favorite designs and colors. You can put your name on a virtual Coke bottle and &ldquo;share&rdquo; it on social media. You can even custom-build your own shades on Oakley.com, creating your own unique pair of sunglasses.</p><p> These brands, and many more, are using personalization to grow their brands and generate conversations among users. According to a report by Bain.com, they are discovering that they can elevate customer loyalty and engagement &mdash; and use their customer base as an engine of advocacy to potential buyers. By providing customization options, brands raise loyalty at a time when it&rsquo;s more important than ever. In a recent Bain survey of more than 1,200 global executives across a range of industries, 67% believed their customers are becoming less loyal to the brand. Customization also helps companies reach specific customers &mdash; such as the unpredictable millennial generation.</p><p> In the investment industry, it is paramount for clients to remain committed to their investment strategies in order to reach their long-term goals. Just like Nike and Coca-Cola have used personalization to grow loyalty and target new customers, the investment industry can use personalization to connect with a new generation of clients and reinforce the importance of financial planning with current clients.</p><p> <strong>  Helping Clients Stay in the Game with a Personalized Approach </strong></p><p> Many of the most successful advisors I know consider their clients friends. Their offices are adorned with pictures of their clients&rsquo; achievements. There are the college pictures, the retirement parties, the client in the &ldquo;dream car.&rdquo; There are the world travel pictures, wedding pictures, and pictures documenting clients&rsquo; charitable impacts. The diversity of the achievements can be striking, but they are all examples of the power of financial planning in helping people reach their life goals.</p><p> Each of us is unique and each of us has different goals, and the investments should reflect that.</p><p> <strong>  Utilizing Personalization to Curb Emotional Decision-Making </strong></p><p> Ninety percent of advisors say their top challenge in 2015 will be clients&rsquo; emotional reactions to market movements.* We all know that making emotional decisions when investing decreases the odds of reaching one&rsquo;s goals. Clients are most likely to sell out of their investments at market lows and to get caught up in the buying frenzy at market highs.</p><p> What makes personalization so compelling is its ability to provide clients a sense of control over their own destiny. It helps them stay focused on their own needs rather than the day to day frenzies of the market. In doing so, it can prevent emotions from derailing investment plans.</p><p> <strong>  The Old Playbook: Products First, Client Last </strong></p><p> Customization and personalization are at the heart of financial planning. Successful financial advisors are experts at building personalized financial plans with personal benchmarks, but the asset management industry has been slow to catch up in offering personalized investments to support the financial plan. Traditionally, asset management firms have started with the products, promoting strategies that focused on beating benchmarks. Clients too often became focused on irrelevant benchmarks, because that&rsquo;s the only thing we gave them to compare their investments against.</p><p> When clients become too focused on irrelevant benchmarks, it can wreak havoc on their ability to remain committed to their plan. As Don Draper said in Mad Men, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s being said, change the conversation.&rdquo; Keeping clients focused on their own needs requires asset managers to focus on the clients first, and build the product set around their specific needs.</p><p> <strong>  The New Playbook: Client First Investment Strategies </strong></p><p> In the new age of global communications, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stay engaged if we don&rsquo;t find a topic relevant or we&rsquo;re not emotionally connected to it. By helping clients tune out the sheer volume of market noise out there, we can offer them a better experience with a higher probability for success. Here are three ways you can incorporate personalization into the investment planning process:</p><li> Case Design: Ask the asset manager if they offer case design as part of the partnership. Through the case design process, you can ensure the investments are tailor-fit to the meet the client&rsquo;s needs and objectives.</li><li> An Income Plan with Personal Benchmarks: The right income planning software can help you identify the impact of outside sources of income such as social security and assets held away from your advisory oversight. It can help you identify the client&rsquo;s personal benchmark and use it to ensure the client is on track to maintain their lifestyle in retirement.</li><li> Advanced Unified Managed Account Technology (UMA): Since a personalized investment portfolio often requires multiple strategies, the number of accounts and individual strategies are best suited as &ldquo;sleeves&rdquo; within a single account. The right UMA technology can help you simplify paperwork and reporting and make changes in the allocation when necessary. <br/>  </li><p> Connect a client&rsquo;s investments to all the things that define them, and you&rsquo;re delivering a very powerful concept. Products and services are becoming more and more personalized. Isn&rsquo;t it time for investments to join the movement?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What, exactly, is the Millennial generation?</h3><p> <br/> Millennials (also known as the Millennial Generation or Generation Y) are the demographic cohort of individuals born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. There are more than 80 million of them in the US alone, making their generation larger than Baby Boomers and 20 percent larger than Generation X. Based on research conducted by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.millennialmarketing.com/who-are-millennials/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Millennial Marketing  </a> </u> , we know the following about this generation:</p><li> Millennials include some of the earliest digital natives.</li><li> Millennials are interested in participating in your marketing.</li><li> Millennials are known as content creators and users.</li><li> Millennials are &lsquo;&rsquo;hooked&rsquo;&rsquo; on social media.</li><li> Millennials grew up in a socially networked world.</li><li> Millennials have an estimated purchasing power of between $125 billion to $890 billion</li><p> <strong>  Millennials As the Young Investor </strong></p><p> Young and potentially wealthy millennials can be an extremely profitable segment for Advisors and present an excellent opportunity for Advisors to expand their client base. Ironically, they also seem to be a large segment of the population largely overlooked by financial firms. Many Advisors are business people following the money as they seek higher fees and more commissions. However, any Advisor building a business for the long term should find solid opportunity in the millennial group. Advisors can build a relationship with them as they continue to grow and aspire to be high-net-worth retirees someday.   According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/tag/kids-and-money/page/9/\" target=\"_blank\">   Time  </a> </u> , millennials are saving more now than boomers did at their age. They know that they must manage their own financial future and want someone to guide them in a way that makes sense to them.</p><p> I am, in fact, a Millennial. I rely on very specific marketing avenues for information in order to make my decisions.  So, how should Advisors market to me? In part 2 of this series, I will look at the most effective ways Advisors can reach millennials in their marketing efforts. Hint: Content is King.</p><p> But first, let&rsquo;s take a look at Millennial&rsquo;s buying and browsing habits in this Infographic courtesy of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/here-everything-you-need-know-about-millennial-consumer-159139\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AdWeek  </a> </u> . One common theme is that Millennial&rsquo;s expect technology to work and will go elsewhere if it doesn&rsquo;t (hint: importance of mobile optimized sites, which we will cover in part 2).  So, how can you reach the Millennial generation? In one word&hellip;&hellip;online. </p><p>  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/datapoints-millenial-shoppers-02-2014.jpg\"/></p>",

Whether to hire in-house marketers or a marketing agency does not just come down to price, but maximum efficiency, too, as you will see this week. Here&rsquo;s our rundown of the top 8 reasons to outsource some of your marketing work to a firm like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mod Girl Marketing  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  8 Benefits of Hiring A Marketing Agency Over In-House Marketers </strong></p><p> <strong>  1.

You get access to expert content writers, search engine optimization professionals, social media professionals, graphic designers, and web design professionals as well. It can be risky to take a gamble on a new hire. Good help is extremely hard to find, and it can take a long time to find truly passionate, dependable, skilled people to work for your business.

You gain access to the latest technology and tools. </strong></p><p> Marketing tools increase efficiency, productivity, and performance. Sure, there are tools you can dig up for free if you know where to look. But we give our clients access to premium-level services, software, and analytical data reports without charge. Consider the cost of some of the top marketing tools we use:</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=314694&amp;U=333331&amp;M=33269&amp;urllink=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bright Local  </a> </u>  (local SEO) &ndash; $64.99/month</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/raventools\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Raven Tools  </a> </u>  (social media, SEO, PPC) &ndash; $249/month</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/hootsuite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite  </a> </u>  (social media) &ndash; $99/month</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/aweber\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   AWeber  </u>    </a> (email marketing)- $50/month</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://8waysin8days.com/sproutsocial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sprout Social  </a> </u>  (social media, SEO) &ndash; $500/month</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://8waysin8days.com/manageflitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Manage Flitter  </a> </u>  (Twitter management and marketing) &ndash; $49/month PER account</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.releasewire.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ReleaseWire  </a> </u>  (press release distribution, not including writing) &ndash; $70 PER release</p><p> As you can see, we provide premium-level service and eliminate the tough decisions like &ldquo;what to eliminate&rdquo; over budgeting concerns. All told, we save our clients over $40,000 a year on marketing tools alone!</p><p> <strong>  4. You maintain efficiency among your existing staff. </strong></p><p> Some companies try to get around hiring in-house marketers, social media personnel, content writers, and SEO people by just having existing employees pick up the slack. Dumping the marketing burden onto existing employees increases the likelihood of burnout and reduces productivity in the long run. In addition, your marketing efforts will lack consistency with so many heads to the monster.</p><p> <strong>  5. You don&rsquo;t need to train agencies. </strong></p><p> You won&rsquo;t need to send our professionals through an extensive training program, pay for us to attend a seminar, or pay a senior marketer to groom us in the art of digital marketing. Like most reputable marketing agencies, we arrive qualified, experienced, knowledgeable, and ready to work for you.</p><p> <strong>  6. You can easily scale up your marketing efforts. </strong></p><p> Under a traditional in-house operation, the only way you can increase the output of your marketing team is to hire more employees. Agencies like Mod Girl&reg; already have an arsenal of workers on hand that can be called upon at a moment&rsquo;s notice if you want to employ a bigger, bolder strategy.</p><p> <strong>  7. You keep up with the latest marketing trends, without a learning curve. </strong></p><p> What in-house marketer has time to read up on all the latest social media, SEO, content marketing, and branding news? Usually they are so buried in day-to-day tasks, there is no room to grow, change, and evolve. The majority of reputable digital marketing agencies take education very seriously. We invest time into keeping abreast of the latest trends, tools, technologies, and strategies to serve you better. We spend our own time learning how to use new resources, without charging you for the time.</p><p> <strong>  8. You benefit from an outside perspective. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to get tunnel-vision working from the inside. Employees may find it hard to express new ideas or bring up concerns, for fear of losing their jobs. The saying &ldquo;two heads are better than one&rdquo; is definitely true when it comes to marketing. We&rsquo;ve seen amazing results from collaborative marketing efforts. We approach your business from the consumer or client&rsquo;s point of view, and bring a decade of knowing &ldquo;what works&rdquo; to the proverbial table.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/quartsoft_0.png\" width=\"965\"/></p><p> <strong>  The Bottom Line: </strong></p><p> There is one huge reason why companies go through the expense and trouble of hiring an in-house marketing staff. Keeping employees close to you means they know your brand inside-and-out, as no one from the outside can. They eat, sleep, breathe, and promote your corporate culture and work tirelessly for your company full-time. That level of knowledge and devotion is hard to match, no matter how good an outside firm may be.</p><p> For this reason, we feel the ideal set up is to have at least one point person working internally who can collaborate with our marketing agency to help us get to know your brand voice, key messages, best topics for content, and demographics. We will have many ideas to contribute based on trends, statistical data, and competitive analysis, of course, but we find the best results come from working with a dedicated staffer within our client&rsquo;s company. We provide the added manpower, without the added cost!</p><p> Interested in seeing how our boutique marketing agency can help your marketing team increase leads and revenue?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Get in touch with me here  </a> </u>  for a free, no-pressure email consultation.

    "content": "<p> Recent <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/16/this-year-millennials-will-overtake-baby-boomers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pew Research Center  </a> </u> results indicate there are 75 million millennials living in the U.S., with the demographic projected to surpass baby boomers in 2015, making it the nation&rsquo;s largest generation.</p><p> Millennials are often described as diverse, educated and tech savvy, with big career goals and an optimistic future outlook. When it comes to finances, however, the generation has been characterized as risk averse, with many young professionals coming of age during the recession. Some even feel they will not be able to purchase a house or retire until much later in life than their parents, despite making six-figure incomes and paying off a good chunk of their loans.</p><p> No matter how you refer to this booming generation, its sheer size and age range make it a significant force in the economy&mdash;in locally and nationally. With U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimating millennials will comprise more than 40 percent of the U.S. workforce by 2020, it&rsquo;s important for young professionals understand how to maximize their financial potential.</p><p> As someone who works closely with young professionals on a daily basis, I have seen prevalent themes emerge over the years&mdash;from planning and budgeting approaches, to saving and investing. Below are my recommendations for building a successful financial future:</p><p> <b>  Create a Plan </b></p><p> Similar to other pieces of one&rsquo;s life, planning is critical for financial success. The financial action outline doesn&rsquo;t need to be complicated, but a plan provides a starting point and creates a baseline for measuring goals. It may be easiest for the demographic who relies heavily on connected devices to make use of technology, and incorporate relevant programs and apps into the process. For instance, sites such as <a href=\"http://mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mint.com </a> help users understand the complete picture. You can start with the site, document goals, time horizon, investment objectives and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;create a strategy and an action plan.</p><p> The plan can also serve as a basis for creating an individual or family budget. If unsure where to start, consult a financial professional. There are a number of fee-only financial planners who will work with young professionals on an <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/money101/lesson15/index5.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  hourly basis </a> .</p><p> <b>  Start Investing </b></p><p> With time on your side, I recommend starting investing early on to maximize the returns. It&rsquo;s best to keep investments simple and costs low, as a start. For instance, consider utilizing low-cost, broad-based index funds in the portfolio to diversify and reduce investment expenses, and mitigate tax consequences. Reducing costs is often an overlooked method of increasing long term returns in a portfolio.</p><p> A great way to streamline the process is automating an investment program. The amount doesn&rsquo;t have to be significant from the get-go. You can start with a small amount until you get more comfortable with the process and increase it as the budget allows.</p><p> <b>  Plan for Retirement </b></p><p> It&rsquo;s never too early to create a retirement plan. Retirement accounts provide tax-deferred growth, a powerful feature to help boost long-term returns and income decades from now when one stops working. If a company offers a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  401(k) </a> plan, the employee should check if the employer matches a portion of their contributions. At the very least, one should contribute enough to receive the full company match (often around 5 percent of annual pay, though percentages vary).</p><p> A great way to give the retirement account a boost is with company bonuses. For example, if one could live off bonus for a month, he or she may defer their full month of regular pay into the 401(k) or retirement account. With the limit on employee contributions up to $18,000 in 2015, there&rsquo;s even a greater chance to maximize those contributions.</p><p> <b>  Reduce or Eliminate Fees </b></p><p> Creating a financial plan includes physically reviewing all the incoming revenues and outgoing expenses. In doing so, one may notice a number of fees tacked onto bills, loans and other expenses that may otherwise be overlooked. Every fee means less money in your pocket. Banks are often changing their rules and one may be surprised to learn they are paying a fee for something they previously received for free. Challenge yourself to see how many fees you can reduce or remove in the year and consider re-investing the dollars saved into a savings or retirement account.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Selling Twitter Advertising - Should traditional sales methods apply? </strong></p><p> For sure!</p><p> Social media analysis or social media advertising is a service such like any other. These days, it's probably more important to understand all the choices that we as sales people have in regard to social media, but when it comes to the sales process the same principles apply.</p><p> <strong>  Your service might be \"hip\", but are your audiences? </strong></p><p> It really doesn't matter what it is you are selling, there is still people on the other line (or across the table) who make the purchasing decision. Why is it that companies who offer what would be considered \"hip\" services train their sales people in a way that reflects their world rather than resonating with the buyer's environment.</p><p> People who follow me probably know where this is going. I usually write about personal experiences and this article is not different. I had a sales experience with a Twitter ad sales person the other day.........</p><p> A couple of weeks ago I got a coupon for $50 to spend on Twitter ads. So, I went on-line and created an ad that I hoped would get me some responses. It didn't but that was probably due to my lack of expertise in that area.</p><p> So, a couple of days later I got an email from a Twitter sales representative who introduced himself as my personal guide in that area with the suggestion to schedule a call so we can optimize my Twitter advertising efforts. I gladly accepted because I always welcome best practices.</p><p> <strong>  Automation is great, but only if it works </strong></p><p> We scheduled the call. Then a couple of days later I got another email from the same person asking me to schedule an appointment. \"I wanted to follow up with you to schedule some time for us to talk about optimizing your Twitter advertising\".</p><p> \"We already scheduled time for tomorrow\", was my response. Obviously a glitch in their \"lead generation\" which doesn't make you feel special as a person when you find out that the person you will be talking to doesn't send their own emails  it's obviously generated by a system. Oh well, I thought. Welcome to our new world.</p><p> The appointment was scheduled for 4 pm to 4:25, which I thought was oddly specific, only to find out that my representative called 6 minutes after 4 pm. When I pointed it out (as I am a stickler for punctuality, honoring other people's time) he casually said \"Yes, I am late because I am running over from a previous call\".  Doesn't exactly give you a warm and fuzzy feeling.</p><p> <strong>  I don't really understand the business value of Twitter, yet </strong></p><p> We started the call and overall it was OK, nothing outstanding but a few nuggets of insight. I told the representative bluntly that while I was really knowledgeable on LinkedIn I was still struggling to fully understand the business value of Twitter. \"That's OK\", he replied without further going into it. Is it really, was my first recaction.</p><p> We finished the call 6 minutes early (maybe there is some method to this) and the sales person promised to follow up with an email recapping everything that we had discussed. <strong>  This was a week ago and I am still waiting. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Maybe I should tweet him? </strong></p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Booking a holiday used to involve going into a travel agent and sitting, waiting whilst he or she spent time trawling through the incoherent mess of airline timetables. Nowadays an entire trip can be finalised without ever having to leave the house (though my father-in-law still insists upon the human interaction).</p><p> I can&rsquo;t even remember the last time I went into a bank and spoke with a teller, though I am sure many people still do. Everything I need can be done more efficiently via internet banking.</p><p> There was once a time when buying online was tantamount to handing out free access to your bank account. Nowadays, Amazon are the worlds largest supermarkets, though just try visiting their shop floor or speaking to an employee. Still, they have some of the most satisfied customers of all.</p><p> <strong>  Technology these days is not just an option. For many, it&rsquo;s a preference. </strong></p><p> Last week an adviser I&rsquo;ve known for some time asked me a question. It inspired me to put fingers to keyboard.</p><p> He said he was conflicted between embracing online advice vs. continuing the personalised, tailored approach. In all honesty, he was reticent to give up his current structure.</p><p> I found myself absolutely empathising with the plight. Most great advisers are at their best when eyeball-to eyeball with clients. It&rsquo;s where they shine.</p><p> The problem is that when the times you can add value are limited to your personal exertion, you&rsquo;ve got a capacity issue.</p><p> The most common reason for changing adviser these days?  &ldquo;We have an adviser, but we rarely hear from him/ her.&rdquo;</p><p> Meanwhile, other businesses, the types your clients are also dealing with on a day-to-day basis, are finding more ways to create value without insisting upon face time.</p><p> Most hotels these days will remember your choice of newspaper after just a few visits.</p><p> Amazon will remember what you were looking at when you logged in months ago, and provide suggestions of other products you might be interested in.</p><p> Apparently AMEX now has a system where their most valued clients are instantly connected to the same client services team whenever they call the number on the back of their card.</p><p> <strong>  As far back as 1981, futurist John Naisbitt saw it coming when he wrote    &ldquo;The more &ldquo;high tech&rdquo; humans have, the more &ldquo;high touch&rdquo; humans want&ldquo;.  He nailed it. </strong></p><p> We are in a world where people want to be engaged more than ever before. Some clients will want face to face time and value that most; however others prefer to engage remotely and want to maximise what they can do without having to invest time in meeting.</p><p> I think the latter are the growing market.</p><p> The two biggest things however that point me to believe that advisers need to embrace online advice models are:</p><li> <strong>  Most firms have little chance of being efficient enough to generate sufficient revenue if they don&rsquo;t use technology far better than they do currently, and </strong></li><li> <strong>  It&rsquo;s going to become increasingly hard to stand out from the crowd if the only way you can WOW clients is when they are in your office. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Technological innovation can solve these constraints, and no-one is better positioned to innovate the use of technology to engage advice clients than SME advice firms.</p><p> <strong>  No matter how deep the pockets or fervent the desires of bigger institutions, product providers or Licensees, your business has a better opportunity than all of them. </strong></p><p> A pre-requisite for being able to innovate using the Lean Startup methodologies pioneered in Silicon Valley is to be able to have a direct dialogue with your end user. That&rsquo;s the competitive advantage advice firms like yours have. You are better positioned to understand your clients problems than 1,000 focus groups, an army of marketing specialists or the best data analysis money can buy.</p><p> A few months ago, I was speaking with a friend who is in the middle of his own online startup. We were talking about data &ndash; what to collect, how to collect it and how to use it. He asked what information advice businesses held on their clients.</p><p> When I told him, I watched his jaw drop. He salivated a little. I think I saw his eyes glaze over too.</p><p> One of my favourite quotes is from the visionary author William Gibson, who said <strong>  &ldquo;The future is already here &mdash; it&rsquo;s just not very evenly distributed.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> How advice firms use technology to better engage clients and influence their financial behaviour is no longer a theoretical discussion. It&rsquo;s an essential work in progress.</p><p> The question is not whether your business embraces the opportunity to create advice delivery models of the future, it&rsquo;s how you do it and how long you wait before you start to play catch-up.</p><p> <strong>  What will be the experiments you start today to uncover the future of your business model? </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Like many others I have considered the concept of the professional services firm consisting of individuals focussing on what they do best to be an ideal worth pursuing.</p><p> The concept of a professional firm requiring 3 distinctly different roles of a Finder, Minder &amp; Grinder is the thinking of one of the most influential authors &amp; thinkers of my professional life.   <u>  David Maister </u>  literally wrote the book on building, structuring and then managing a professional services firm.  It happens that he wrote quite a few other books, a number of which are utterly relevant to todays financial services professionals.</p><p> Playing to the strengths of the different skillsets and mindsets which human beings have is what led Maister to conclude that an effective firm allowed those who were naturally hunters, or rainmakers, to focus upon the pursuit of new opportunities and landing clients.  They are the Finders.  Those more naturally suited to the patient process of managing relationships and paying attention to the execution of tasks diligently serve the firm best as Minders.  And in every professional services firm there is the need for the technically proficient, probably quite analytical (if not &ldquo;anal&rdquo;) producer of detail which is rooted in fact, research and analysis.  There hides the Grinder.</p><p> <strong>  Here is the question specifically for financial services firms which I have been asking: is the Finder, Minder, Grinder concept dead already for us? </strong></p><p> Many individuals have tried to build practices founded upon this concept in financial services, and I cannot think of many where they have done it successfully.  Partly because the industry has a naturally strong leaning towards those who are naturally Finders or Minders&hellip;.but not so many Grinders.  Yet the model has worked very well in other fields, especially law and accountancy where entire firms of substantial size work this way: </p><p> The leverage the professional practice seeks is created largely on the back of the ability to hire and keep Finders, who in turn create opportunities for key account management by the Minders. They in turn groom tomorrows Minders or Finders by mentoring them in their technical competencies as Grinders to begin with, and in time elevating them to Minder positions.</p><p> The Finders virtually cannot be contained in any other role&hellip;.they Find their way to prominence through their personal networking and promotion ability, which is more &ldquo;mindset&rdquo; than &ldquo;skillset&rdquo; I suspect.</p><p> The problem for financial advisers is that we tend to be forced through overt regulation, or compliance requirements, into a Grinding role much of the time. The industry structure being what it is in terms of remuneration, established practice valuation methodology and key behavioural levers drive all advisers to actively pursue one of the other 2 roles as well.</p><p> Therefore nearly all advisers have found themselves thus far becoming Finder-Grinders or Minder-Grinders, and therefore have a strong leaning towards &ldquo;sales&rdquo; or &ldquo;advice&rdquo; as a result.  The Finder-Grinders leaning towards &ldquo;sales&rdquo; is not an indication that they are any less professional; they just have a different mindset and skillset. They like hunting mostly&hellip;.but know they have to do a bit of farming and stuff around the farm too these days.  For these advisers the &ldquo;grinding part is an absolute chore.  At best they can usually be described as &ldquo;coping&rdquo; in that area.  While they are coping though, it lessens their effectiveness as Finders.</p><p> The Minder-Grinders do better than cope with the Grinding side of the game&hellip;they tend to do well at it, which drives them into the space of being &ldquo;advice&rdquo; providers.  They however tend to focus on patiently growing the productivity of the farm and lovingly nurture every flowering plant.</p><p> David Maister&rsquo;s model does not quite fit for the financial services sector.  I say that with the utmost respect, and believe that he is an innovative and creative thinker and was absolutely spot on with his thinking at the time for the majority of professional services sectors. His thinking still stands and is (I believe) entirely valid for those professional service sectors with little to no direct regulatory intervention, and who operate only in the advice arena.</p><p> They dynamics in financial services are different however, and some of those key changes occurred well after Maister produced his masterpiece.</p><p> The model for the successful financial services firm of the future will still play to the differing mindsets and skillsets of the humans involved, but with clear separation of management from advice.  Those in the advice area must work with a constant overlay: Everyone has to be able to &ldquo;do the job&rdquo;. Regulators demand it, and that requirement cannot be ignored.</p><p> <strong>  But here is the thing: every professional adviser also has to be able to &ldquo;get the job&rdquo; to build a successful practice. </strong></p><p> The successful financial adviser of the future has two core functions:</p><p> 1. Get the job</p><p> 2. Do the job</p><p> That is it.  Much of what Maister called &ldquo;Minding&rdquo; is for financial advisers a key element of &ldquo;getting the (next) job&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  R.I.P. to the accepted wisdom for growing a professional financial advice practice. </strong></p><p> If the financial adviser must remain focused upon getting the job and then doing the job, then the practice model has to change.  Unlike Maister&rsquo;s model where The Finders are creating opportunity which is driven down the pyramid, the financial services model centres upon the delivery of advice, and all else within the practice must be focused upon ensuring that the adviser is focused just on their core deliverable.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/practice-structure.jpg\" width=\"480\"/></p><p> There is a need for focused business management.  That may well be a former adviser fulfilling the role of CEO, or General Manager, or Partner&hellip;.or whatever commercial structure and role description suits.  What is essential though is that there is dedicated business management driving the practice.</p><p> Leverage for the practice is introduced from management doing some of the &ldquo;Finding&rdquo; through marketing and brand building; via non-advice staff, who fundamentally provide all of the service and &ldquo;Minding&rdquo; functions (and a significant number of &ldquo;Grinding&rdquo; functions such as research and template creation) which are not directly linked to delivery of specific advice to a client;  and; the use of systems and technology to create efficiencies in both human time requirements and physical overheads for the practice.</p><p> Financial Advisers live in an era where all must be Grinders &ndash; at least some of the time.  To build a successful practice in that world the practice must be built around the delivery of advice of course, but the advisers job is to only focus on getting the engagement, and delivering the engagement.  All else is actually business management and operations &ndash; and that is what a successful practice of the future is investing in building, rather than more technically brilliant advice.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ll begin my story with the real life tale of two would-be authors.</p><p> The first was a very successful professional in her industry. We had been discussing the publication of her book with my publishing company when she stated that she was very excited about publishing the book because she wanted to retire and live off of the royalties.</p><p> The second was a young executive in a growing startup in a new industry who wanted a way to gain some credibility and visibility for his new company. He recognized that he wasn&rsquo;t going to become rich from book royalties but instead viewed his book as his new &ldquo;business card&rdquo; and would use it to gain visibility with prospects and position himself well in an industry that knew little about him or his company.</p><p> My independent publishing company, People Tested Media, decided to move forward with the young executive and wished the first professional well in her retirement. This may have much to do with the business model of my independent publishing company. We&rsquo;re not a major publisher and rather than working through agents, we work directly with authors, most of who are interested in using their books as a means to grow their business.</p><p> I hope that the first professional finds an opportunity to publish her book as her years of experience will produce an informative and valuable book. Her options will be to find a major publisher or to self-publish. Either way, she will find herself working hard in retirement because either option will require her to market her book.</p><p> <strong>  Yes, the reality is that even if you find a major publisher, you need to be prepared for marketing your own book! </strong> Finding and securing a major publisher can be a boon for many authors but by no means will it allow the author to sit back and just watch the royalties pour in &ndash; unless you&rsquo;re Stephen King or John Grisham.</p><p> We published the book by the young executive and he has worked diligently to use the book as his new &ldquo;calling card&rdquo; to gain clients and visibility in his industry. With it, he has been able to secure speaking engagements, meetings with prospects who wouldn&rsquo;t answer his calls before and gain opportunities in his industry that he didn&rsquo;t even know existed. His business has grown significantly, along with gaining respectable sales on Amazon that continue to grow each week due to the domino effect of increasing visibility and referral sales.</p><p> Just as many professionals have recognized the reach they can have with blogs and online forums, <strong>  converting content into a print book or ebook can provide a professional the ability to gain credibility and visibility for themselves and their business. </strong></p><p> This credibility can lead to speaking engagements, meetings with prospects and additional revenue sources for those professionals who are willing to use these books for business growth. Many small businesses are incorporating the creation of a book into their business plan.</p><p> &ldquo;Having a book with your name on it may not indicate that you&rsquo;re the smartest person on a topic, but it clearly shows that you&rsquo;re knowledgeable on a subject, and often this is all that&rsquo;s needed to get you in the door with those prospects and clients who are going to allow your business to grow,&rdquo; says Dan McGrath, author of &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/What-Dont-Know-About-Retirement/dp/0985082097/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427135329&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=what+you+don%27t+know+about+retirement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   What You Don&rsquo;t Know About Retirement Will Hurt You!&rsquo;  </u>    </a></p><p> Dan brought a number of professionals who were focused on the growing concerns of healthcare costs in retirement together as co-authors for his book. &ldquo;The book allowed us to bring a wealth of knowledge together in one place and provided a unique and valuable book for the reader, while also providing a platform for all of the authors to showcase their knowledge and gain visibility they didn&rsquo;t have before,&rdquo; McGrath says.</p><p> The book has succeeded on many levels for McGrath and his fellow authors. The book has allowed them to gain speaking engagements, meetings with large investment prospects as well as strong sales on Amazon, where the book had reached number 1 in the retirement planning category.</p><p> &ldquo;The success of the book on Amazon is due to the fact that each of the authors is marketing the book when they market themselves as we all use the book as a calling card to allow us to gain prospects for our businesses,&rdquo; McGrath points out. &ldquo;When you have six authors marketing a book, it helps not only the sales of the book, but everyone&rsquo;s credibility and visibility as well.&rdquo;</p><p> As stated earlier, the reality is that whether you publish a book on your own or with a publisher, an author will end up doing the majority of the marketing themselves. By self-publishing, partnering with others or using a small publisher such as People Tested Media rather than fighting the battle to get a major publisher interested in your work, the marketing that an author has to do can be rewarded by gaining more control over their product as well as earning more in royalties.</p><p> McGrath cautions, &ldquo;Although it&rsquo;s easy to self publish a book, you need to make sure that the quality of your book matches what you want to convey to the public or else a poorly written and conceived book can do more damage to your business than having no book at all.&rdquo;</p><p> McGrath stresses the benefits of not &ldquo;going it alone&rdquo; and finding partners who understand the book creation process such as an independent publisher like People Tested Media because he still finds that publishing with a publisher, even an independent, still adds further credibility to a book. However you choose to publish, and whoever you use, McGrath feels that success for a book and a business will always take hard work and effort mainly on the part of the author.</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sitting around waiting for the royalties to come in. I&rsquo;m out there everyday fighting for business, but using a successful book with my name on it as a calling card is opening more doors for me and allowing me to reach prospects I couldn&rsquo;t get in front of before,&rdquo; McGrath says.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Ernie Bello |  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tenetpartners\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tenet Partners  </a> </u></p><p> The modern age of the mobile web was heralded by Apple in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone. <strong>  Apple set to redefine what a mobile phone could be, but what nobody expected was how it caused a paradigm shift in computing, one from our desktop to our pocket. With it came the invention of modern web techniques to cater to the growing mobile audience like responsive design and a renewed focus on performance. </strong> We began to take for granted the notion that the entire world wide web is accessible wherever we are. Today support for mobile is no longer a luxury,  <u>  <a href=\"http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/opinion/2353616/mobile-now-exceeds-pc-the-biggest-shift-since-the-internet-began\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   it&rsquo;s an imperative  </a> </u> .</p><p> Almost eight years later, another paradigm shift in computing is rapidly approaching: from our pocket to our wrist. Google introduced Android Wear last year, and Apple will be launching its Apple Watch on April 24th. Wearable computing opens up exciting new possibilities, but it also raises many questions about how we&rsquo;ll be using them. What is the primary use for a smart watch? To tell time? To track health and fitness? How will it practically extend what is already available on our phones? We simply won&rsquo;t know until we try them on and settle in.</p><p> But what does a smart watch mean for the web specifically? Apple&rsquo;s known to be an opinionated company, so let&rsquo;s take a look at what they think a watch should do. Refer to this image showing the default apps loaded on the Apple Watch.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re an iPhone or Mac user, and if you look closely enough, you might notice something missing. There&rsquo;s no Safari icon. There&rsquo;s no mention of the web at all on their  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/built-in-apps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   page describing built-in functionality  </a> </u> . Apple has predicted that browsing the web on a watch isn&rsquo;t something people will be clamoring for. I agree wholeheartedly. With the largest Apple Watch having a screen size of 42mm, it&rsquo;s hardly going to be a fun experience panning and zooming around your favorite site, let alone trying to type in the address of the site you&rsquo;d like to visit.</p><p> If we agree that it would be less than optimal to browse the web on your wrist, what does this mean overall for the mobile web? Is it doomed as we gradually transition to wearable computing?</p><p> <strong>  The Web is dead, long live the Web </strong></p><p> Apple clearly believes that the future lies with apps. This has been a trend for many years since the introduction of the App Store for iOS, and with the Apple Watch it will be the only way to accomplish your favorite activities. What it means for the modern software designer is to think in terms of services and to ensure that service oriented architecture is baked in from the beginning.</p><p> Many of the apps you already know and love wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without the web services and APIs that were built to support them. There are countless examples, but email and social media are ones that are ubiquitous. If you have a Gmail account you can access your email in a number of different ways. Open gmail.com in your browser, open up your mail client, install the Gmail app on your phone. All of these talk to the same service that Google provides behind the scenes. Facebook and Twitter are other examples. There are a number of Twitter apps that you can install or you can visit twitter.com in your browser. Any way you access will read from and write to the same set of core data.</p><p> At Tenet Partners the tools we build to help manage brands &mdash; whether it be  <u>  <a href=\"http://tenetpartners.com/work/travelers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   online guidelines  </a> </u> , a  <u>  <a href=\"http://tenetpartners.com/work/cfa-institute.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   digital asset manager  </a> </u> , or a  <u>  <a href=\"http://tenetpartners.com/work/xerox.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   brand review tool  </a> </u>  &mdash; are designed for the service enabled world.</p><p> Nowadays, the web is powered by these services, and they enrich our lives by the possibilities they enable on web sites and apps across all the devices we use. In that regard the Apple Watch will be no different. I&rsquo;m excited for the potential of wearable computing, and can&rsquo;t wait to see how it will change my daily life. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll miss that Safari icon at all.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  If you find yourself constantly resorting to generic answers when people ask you questions about yourself, it may be time to rethink your approach. </strong> So often we drift through our day, not even seeing the opportunities we have in conversations with others. From the simplest \"Hey, how are you?\" to the more complex questions you are asked throughout your work day -- how often do you take time to answer the questions fully?</p><p> A critical question we so often shy away from answering in a powerful way and one that can open doors to a world of opportunity is: <strong>  &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> I have heard even the most seasoned professionals use the old standard, black and white description of their business. As an example they answer: \"I am a financial advisor.\" Although you are concisely stating exactly what you do with that answer, you are also opening the door for all of the stereotypes and preconceived notions they associate with that title or profession.</p><p> For many, you would be tossed into the broad category of salesperson and forgotten in their minds. Simply said: The real benefits are being left open to hope (I sure hope they know what a financial advisor does). But in order for action, they must want what you have -- and it's your job to make them want it!</p><p> However, talking about yourself and your products with more detail often comes across as sales-y, boastful or meaningless. For example, if a financial advisor says, \"I hold the CFA designation.&rdquo; <strong>  Okay, great...so what does that really mean to the person you are talking with? </strong>  </p><p> Instead, try using a phrase that I have heard some top advisors use. Follow the black and white feature statement with an absolute home run connector statement that gives you the right to talk about your expertise or other benefits of your services. For instance: \"I hold the CFA designation. And let me tell you why I think that may be important to you.\"</p><p> The statement, <strong>  &ldquo;And let me tell you why I think that may be important to you\" </strong> gives you the right to share why something may be important to them. It will still be a factual description of what you do -- but this time with meaning directly for the person you're talking with. And it may just be the opportunity to put preconceived notions to rest and build your value -- without coming across \"sales-y.\"</p>",

    "link": "the-inherent-fiduciary-duty-that-an-investment-adviser-must-adhere-to",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a></p><p> When an individual is in need of help with managing their finances and investments, there are a myriad of options of professional guidance to choose from. The financial services providers one might look to engage typically can be an insurance agent, a registered representative, who is commonly referred to as stock broker, an estate planning attorney, an accountant, or perhaps last but certainly not least a registered investment adviser (RIA) firm. In addition, some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/investment-advisor-representative-exam-and-registration-requirements\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investment advisers  </a> </u>  are licensed to sell additional financial products such as insurance or are dually registered as a registered representative.</p><p> <strong>  An Investment Adviser's Fiduciary Duty </strong></p><p> RIA firms are generally regulated by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_Advisers_Act_of_1940\" target=\"_blank\">   Investment Advisers Act of 1940  </a> </u>  and relevant state statutes which stipulate that an investment adviser must act in the best interest of a client. The Advisers Act bounds an investment adviser to a fiduciary duty, that they clearly know their client and have provided complete disclosure. Sections of Rule 206 of the Act specifically prohibit an RIA firm from using deceptive or manipulative tactics and from conducting fraudulent business activities. Above all else, an investment adviser must demonstrate trustworthiness and allegiance to his or her clients.</p><p> One way to document a thorough understanding of a client&rsquo;s financial needs, risk tolerance, and the goals they are looking to achieve is to create an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for each adviser and client relationship. An IPS can be developed to model the advisory relationship after obtaining an overall picture of a client&rsquo;s finances, risks and objectives. Such a policy is a great way to create a defined outline and plan to manage a client&rsquo;s particular financial situation. The policy can serve as a compass to provide direction, alignment and as a road map to consistently ensure that the adviser and client are on the same page. An IPS may also help to document that the adviser knows their client and can act in the best interest in creating client portfolio allocations and selecting investments.</p><p> <strong>  Establishing an RIA Compliance Program </strong></p><p> To ensure an RIA firm is upholding the duties under the adviser act, the SEC and state(s) generally require every RIA firm to establish a compliance program which includes  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-supervision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   adhering to written policies and procedures  </a> </u> . Each advisory firm needs to tailor a compliance program designed for the particular advisory practice and the types of services being provided. Processes need to be in place to address any potential conflicts and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-regulatory-deficiencies-found-during-compliance-examinations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   avoid violations  </a> </u>  of the Advisers Act and other relevant regulations.</p><p> An essential element of fully disclosing all facets of an advisory business and any potential conflicts of interests is through the requirement that all investment advisory firms maintain and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-brochure-delivery\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   deliver the Form ADV Part 2A brochure  </a> </u>  to existing and prospective clients. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-compliance-form-adv-privacy-policy-annual-delivery-requirements\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Form ADV brochure  </a> </u>  must be written in plain English and should contain pertinent information related to the firm&rsquo;s investment analysis, fee structure, background and credentials of each associated investment adviser representative (IAR) as well as outside business activities being conducted. It is very prudent to consistently  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/does-your-ria-firm-form-adv-part-1-match-its-form-adv-part-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   review these documents and regular updates to correct any inconsistencies  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Fiduciary Duty Does Not Apply to all in the Industry </strong></p><p> This fiduciary duty is not something that all financial services professionals need to stand by. There are other financial services professionals such as a registered representative (RR) of a broker-dealer (BD) that merely need to make suitable investment recommendations for their clients. Once investment suitability is met, the investment may be appropriate for a client, however; there may be other variables that may not serve the client&rsquo;s best interests, such as having higher fees than similar investments and added compensation incentives to position certain products such as monetary bonuses or other rewards. </p><p> This particular topic has been continuously debated for many years and specifically recently the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150317/FREE/150319919/secs-mary-jo-white-says-agency-will-develop-fiduciary-rule-for\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revisited a universal fiduciary standard  </a> </u>  for registered investment advisers and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/does-finra-regulate-registered-investment-adviser-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)  </a> </u>  member registered representatives, as well as rhetoric from Congress, the Department of Labor (DOL) and even the  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3718640/obama-advocates-fiduciary-standard/\" target=\"_blank\">   President of the United States. has touched on the topic  </a> </u>  in various forums.</p><p> The average investor may not be aware of the fiduciary duty an investment adviser is legally bound to.  Anyone seeking to implore services from a financial professional should conduct in depth research pertaining to the disclosure or complaint history of the individual and their firm. Common sense can quite possibly dictate that working with a professional that is held to a strict level of moral conduct and ethics could be a more appropriate fit.</p><p> Although this still remains a hot topic of conversation throughout the financial advisor industry, currently it is solely an investment adviser that must comply with their fiduciary duty. It is essential that in managing an RIA firm that the principal(s), investment adviser representatives and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/what-role-does-a-compliance-consultant-play-to-help-a-ria-firms-cco\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chief Compliance Officer  </a> </u>  ensure that all aspects related to the RIA firm such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-advertising\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advertising  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-brochure-delivery\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   disclosure brochures  </a>  ,   <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-investment-activities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investment processes  </a> </u> , trading practices, etc. are all conforming to representations of the business being conducted and not  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-unethical-practices\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   deceiving or manipulative  </a> </u> . All of this all ultimately instills the inherent duty to act as a fiduciary. An investment adviser is held to the highest standard in the financial advisor industry and always must exhibit the nature of goodwill when working with clients. </p><p> Lexington Compliance and RIA in a Box LLC are not law firms, investment advisory firms, or CPA firms.

    "content": "<p> In a post called  <strong>  <u>   Where Is the Internet Boom?  </u> </strong> , Princeton economics student Evan Soltas tries to determine (mostly with  <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product\" target=\"_blank\">    GDP   </a>  </strong> </u>  data) how economies have benefitted, in a macro sense, from the incredible productivity increases wrought by the Internet. Not to issue spoilers, but: Soltas finds no evidence of an \"Internet Boom.\" None whatsoever. <br/> <br/> You'd think all the happy talk (by people like Google's Eric Schmidt, and generations of IT bigwigs before him) about the immeasurable benefits attendant to connectivity would inevitably come with some sort of proof. You'd think prosperity would show up somewhere, somehow, as a result of something as stupendous as the Internet. Instead, what we have in the U.S. is a more-educated population working longer and harder for flat-to-miniscule wage increases. Facebook, Apple, Google, and other technology-leadership companies routinely export jobs out of the U.S. (not just menial factory-work jobs but the good jobs we're always told by politicians we can look forward to if we major in technical subjects). The menialization of U.S. jobs&mdash;a process that began well before the financial collapse of 2008&mdash;has made us into a nation of floor sweepers and Starbucks baristas, and unless you're a bigtime economic-reality denialist, it's pretty damn clear that the Internet Era has (oh how miraculous!) just happened to coincide with the appearance of monumental wealth disparity around the world. Three billion people now make less than $2.50 a day, while the number of billionaires in the world keeps increasing.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"321\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-24-at-3.23.40-PM.png\" width=\"423\"/></p><p> Note that the billionaire curve took a sharp increase in slope well ahead of the 2008 collapse, pausing only briefly after 2008 before resuming its sharp upward trajectory. <br/> <br/> It's pretty evident that if you wanted to use economic data to show that the Internet is driving us toward a future of servitude and class warfare, it wouldn't be that hard to do a dissertation on the subject. (Left to the reader as an exercise.) <br/> <br/> <strong>  I added a Comment at the end of the Soltas post: </strong></p>Great post. What I think history will eventually show is that the Internet destroyed far more economic activity than it created, by devaluing human labor (and expertise) and enlarging workforce markets from essentially local, to global, so that the \"cheapest bidders\" from around the globe are now a part of every labor market that can utilize remote workers. These effects have resulted in what <strong> <a href=\"http://nakedcapitalism.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  NakedCapitalism.com </a></strong> and others have called the crapification of U.S. jobs (every good job that can be exported will be, or has been) and the creation of a nation of Walmart greeters. The Internet has also, of course, expanded supply chains globally, an effect that is still playing out with the collapse of oil prices (which will soon make container transport \"too cheap to meter\"). Meanwhile, Google and Facebook and others continue to appropriate, and profit immensely from, personal browsing data, using said data to enrich themselves without enrichng or hiring workers. Very few knowledge workers are lucky enough to get a job with Google (or any similar company); Facebook, meanwhile, famously exports jobs to cheaper labor forces. (FB streams are hand-censored by armies of low-cost workers in the Philippines.) It's a myth that the Internet has created, or would ever create, prosperity on a large scale. What the facts show is that it has created the most monumental wealth disparity in the history of the world.<p> Amazon has decimated malls all over North America. The Internet has put countless magazines and newspapers out of business (and gutted the printing industry, front to back). It has killed traditional film photography (Kodak a burned-out hulk); killed album-based music; killed the U.S. Postal Service; killed tons of small businesses; and by broadening access to overseas sources of supply, it has helped kill U.S. manufacturing generally. <br/> <br/> But it's worse than that. Any answer to any question can (in theory) be looked up online, hence expertise has been fundamentally (and forever) devalued, rendering the idea of a \"knowledge worker\" somewhat comical and the dollar value of a college education questionable, to say the least. <br/> <br/> John Maynard Keynes speculated nearly a century ago that by the year 2000 we'd all be working 15-hours weeks with our feet propped up. He'd probably be horrified to know that today, 14.5% of Americans live in poverty and 49.1 million citizens of \"the world's bread-basket\" live in food-insecure households; meanwhile  <u>  <a href=\"http://visualeconomics.creditloan.com/the-state-of-the-40-hour-workweek/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   86% of men and 66% of women in the U.S. work more than 40 hours a week  </a> </u> . The statistics are clear, abundant, and (thanks to the Internet) easy to find, and they pretty much show prosperity (by any rational definition) nose-diving since the introduction of broadband.  <br/> <br/> The Internet Era coincides with unprecedented wealth disparity, worker exploitation, business disruption, and (for many) outright privation. You can call it all one big fat coincidence if you want (if you're that blind). Whatever it is? It sucks for a lot of people.</p><p>  </p>",

    "title": "Advisers: The Misnomer About Cyber",
    "link": "advisers-the-misnomer-about-cyber",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  When investment advisers use the cloud, they are making a conscious, informed decision to outsource tasks to vendors who may have particular expertise or infrastructure in place to handle such tasks. </strong> From hosted email archiving to compliance reporting, and from hosted backups to client communication portals, moving data to the cloud can help many firms address business needs while enabling them to focus more on their core business &ndash; providing investment advice. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission has made it clear that while financial professionals can outsource processes, they cannot delegate the ultimate responsibility for the performance of those functions. After all, it is the investment adviser who is in the trusted position of a fiduciary with respect to the adviser&rsquo;s clients. It is a mistaken assumption that if the cloud provider has a failure such as a data breach, outage, or failing to perform the contracted level of service, the cloud provider bears all the blame as well as all costs the adviser may suffer as a result of the vendor&rsquo;s failure. During our initial conversations with firms within the investment community, we discover a misguided belief that their liability is eliminated when utilizing a cloud provider. This article addresses that misnomer and ways to protect your firm. From contractual arrangements pertaining to data breach expenses to encryption of data by cloud providers, and from written assurances to insurance, here are 10 tips to protecting and transferring risk.</p><p> <strong>  1. Inventory and Classify Your Data </strong> <br/> Know what data your firm collects, processes, and maintains. Does it contain personally identifiable information (PII) about your clients? Have you classified your data based on its contents (e.g. public, sensitive, or confidential)? In which states do your clients reside? State regulations may differ with respect to their definitions of PII.</p><p> <strong>  2. Inventory Your Systems </strong> <br/> Understand what computing systems you have, and where your data is stored on such systems. Which information is stored in which places?</p><p> <strong>  3. Perform a Gap Analysis </strong> <br/> Are your information safeguards for various systems commensurate with the level of protection required for the type of data stored on these systems? What do your policies and procedures require with respect to encryption and access controls? Are you complying with your stated procedures?</p><p> <strong>  4. Identify the Business Need </strong> <br/> If considering a third party service provider, establish a sound business case for the use of the vendor. Moving data to a hosted environment, for example, may save the firm money in terms of office space for server equipment and the need for in-house IT expertise to update and maintain the hardware. You may be considering the vendor to mitigate business continuity and disaster recovery risk because the vendor may have more resilient backup processes or be better positioned than your firm as an adviser to detect and respond to network intrusion events.</p><p> <strong>  5. Know Your Risk Management Options   </strong> <br/> Risk assessments and gap analyses are useful in identifying the vulnerabilities and risks of your firm, and which can be addressed by implementing additional controls or outsourcing functions to a third party provider. Generally, risks can be addressed through four means: (1) avoiding the risk, (2) accepting the risk, (3) mitigating the risk, or (4) transferring the risk. Avoiding risk is difficult and generally involves abstaining from a line of business or practice associated with the risk. Third party service providers can assist in mitigating risk. Firms can also choose to transfer some risk to another party, such as through one or more insurance policies. Finally, firms may be forced to accept certain risks at the point when the cost of additional controls exceeds the expected liability for a security incident.</p><p> <strong>  6. Map Data Flows and Information Sharing </strong> <br/> Know what information you will be sharing with the third party service provider. Does it contain personally identifiable information (PII) about your clients? Does it contain sensitive intellectual property belonging to your firm? If a breach does occur, you will want to know the general nature of the information which was compromised in order to properly assess response strategies.</p><p> <strong>  7. Do Your Due Diligence  </strong> <br/> Your clients entrust you with their information, and they expect you to safeguard it from misappropriation and misuse. It is therefore critical that you perform adequate due diligence on any third party service provider you are considering granting access to this information. Ask sufficient questions in order to obtain assurances that the service provider will safeguard the data, such as the following:</p><li> Does the vendor encrypt your data in transit and at rest?</li><li> What is the vendor&rsquo;s privacy policy?</li><li> Does the vendor have an adequate business continuity plan?</li><li> What information security controls does the vendor have in place? Review the vendor&rsquo;s SSAE-16 or other similar internal controls report, if available to you. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  8. Review Service Level Agreements </strong> <br/> It is imperative that you review Service Level Agreements (SLAs) carefully and ensure that you understand what the vendor is promising in terms of uptime, availability, and responsiveness. The contract negotiation stage is the best time to document in writing whether and how promptly the vendor will notify you in the event of a breach or incident impacting its systems, and which parties are liable for breaches and related expenses when the data is stored on the vendor&rsquo;s systems.</p><p> <strong>  9. Monitor Third Party Providers </strong> <br/> Ongoing monitoring and due diligence is essential to obtain assurances that your vendors are adhering to their SLAs, and that any changes in the vendor&rsquo;s business, operations, hiring practices, or financial condition do not adversely impact your firm&rsquo;s ability to serve your clients. Periodically assess whether your vendors have experienced any data breaches or cybersecurity incidents.</p><p> <strong>  10. Consider Transferring Risk </strong> <br/> After your firm&rsquo;s risks have been addressed through costeffective controls, what remains is called residual risk. If the residual risk is more than your firm is willing to accept as within its risk appetite, transferring some risk to another party through one or more insurance policies may be appropriate. You may have coverage for certain types of risks under Directors and Officers (D&amp;O) policies, Errors and Omissions (E&amp;O) policies, and general liability policies.</p><p> However, some specific risks such as cybersecurity breaches at your firm or at your third party vendors may fall outside the scope of coverage provided by these policies, and you may wish to consider a Cyber Liability Policy to offer protection to your firm. </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Succession planning, done well, creates brilliant competitive advantage. </strong> Poorly executed, at best it&rsquo;s a waste of time, and often creates serious havoc on long term performance.</p><p> All words I&rsquo;ve heard in the last 15 days: &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re too small to need a formal process.&rdquo; &ldquo;Our business is moving so fast we don&rsquo;t have time for that.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re baby boomers and we don&rsquo;t know how&rdquo;(trust me, I would never have included this one until I heard it TWICE this week from different companies looking for help). And the scariest of all, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a family owned-business so the decision is obvious.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  1. Talking People Before Priorities </strong></p><p> Before you can decide WHO you need to be sure on WHAT. Think future vision and the  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/build-your-own-competency-model-a-team-exercise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   competencies  </u>    </a> that will make that possible. Write them down. Then map your people against those possibilities. Choosing people for tomorrow based exclusively on today&rsquo;s performance will slow you down.</p><p> <strong>  2. Cloning </strong></p><p> What often passes for  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/the-green-jacket-effect-teaching-your-team-executive-presense/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   executive presence  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  is a desired mold. Be careful. Sure you want poise, effective communication, and a tidy together look, but the quirky challenger may just what you need to take your strategy to the next level. Too many like minds lead to uninspired strategy.</p><p> <strong>  3. Letting Diversity Trump Common Sense </strong></p><p> If you complete your <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/learning-development/9-box-performance-potential-grid/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   9 box succession planning grid  </u>    </a> and it&rsquo;s all balding white guys with a dry sense of humor in box 9 you clearly have a problem. If it&rsquo;s a perception problem. by all means challenge one another and make it right.</p><p> However, I often find this is less of an issue of discrimination at the succession table, than a problem with hiring and focused leadership development down the line. You can&rsquo;t make anyone ready for the next level by talking yourselves into it or putting diversity multipliers on executive compensation.</p><p> The worse thing you can do is pad your &ldquo;grid&rdquo; by sliding diverse candidates into blocks where they don&rsquo;t belong. Sure, identify opportunities for accelerated growth to make up for lost time. But NEVER promote an unqualified person for diversity reasons. You hurt them, your business, and weaken your diversity strategy.</p><p> <strong>  4. False Consensus </strong></p><p> You know you have a true box 9, high potential when every head at the table is chiming in with a resounding &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p> A succession planning conversation without conflict is useless. The very best talent reviews involve robust discussion and lively debate which leads to important next steps (e.g. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to know my guy better;&rdquo; &ldquo;She needs a stretch assignment.&rdquo;) If I support your guy so you support mine, the business loses.</p><p> <strong>  5. Ignoring the Plan </strong></p><p> The worst succession planning sin of all is going through the motions, and then reverting to the old patterns &ldquo;just this time&rdquo; when it comes to promotion. Trust me, they next thing on everyone&rsquo;s mind the next time you want to hold such a meeting is &ldquo;Why bother?&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t short change your talent strategy. The right people, at the right place, at the right time, will change the game. Be sure you&rsquo;re prepared.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re struggling with succession planning, I can help. I&rsquo;ve facilitated hundreds of succession planning discussions over the years from the executive level, through merger integration, and at the frontline. Succession planning is worth doing well.

I&rsquo;ve updated that article, and provided it here for your reading pleasure.</p><p> I wrote the original article after finishing a roadshow where we got to speak with about 300 risk insurance advisers around Australia; and we discovered some very interesting things. These advisers are in the top echelon of insurance writers in the country, and many of them were keen to share ideas and explore new ways of generating business, including exploring new business models and value propositions.</p><p> One of the topics we discussed was the increasing prominence of direct insurance providers, who place insurance online and over the phone for the general public. The advisers we spoke to were very clear on the fact that while consumers with very limited needs and simple personal situations may be well-served by direct insurance, there is still undoubtedly a need for quality advice.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t turn on the TV nowadays without seeing an advertisement from a direct insurer. But this plethora of television advertising may actually help advisers&ndash;we keep hearing that &lsquo;insurance needs to be sold&rsquo;, and we know that our population is underinsured, so if their advertising dollars motivate people to think about the unthinkable and take action to protect their family, then that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p><p> <strong>  As the advice community, it is then our responsibility to further educate people about the need to seek quality advice to ensure they are actually paying for the right insurance, and that it will be there for them if they need it. </strong></p><p> (* Side note &ndash; I&rsquo;m being interviewed for the Business program on the ABC this week where I&rsquo;ll be discussing the need for people to seek advice when insuring their family. After much discussion, I&rsquo;m cautiously confident that my comments won&rsquo;t be taken out of context&hellip;stay tuned&hellip;.)</p><p> We heard some very interesting stories that were shared about clients seeking insurance from direct providers. We heard a heart-breaking story of a mother of three young children who lost her husband to suicide, and couldn&rsquo;t understand why the insurer was making her jump through hoops to get the life insurance claim paid. There was a 13-month exclusion on suicide, but the policy had been in-force for over four years. The insurer was asking for five years of medical history, looking for evidence that her husband had been treated for depression in the year prior to taking out the cover. At the time of discussion, the claim was still pending, but it is very possible that the young widow will be denied on the basis of a preexisting medical condition.</p><p> Had this family sought advice when obtaining their insurance cover, the adviser would have taken them through the underwriting process at the outset. The adviser may have found an insurer who would have provided cover, and if not, at least the family would have known what they were covered for.</p><p> The benefits of underwriting at the time of application rather than the time of claim cannot be downplayed. Most advisers will facilitate this process when lodging applications, effectively obtaining discounts for good health. The great advisers will set their clients&rsquo; expectations about what is likely to be an arduous process, and then they (or their staff) walk each client through that process of completing forms, booking medicals, chasing up medical reports, organising blood tests, liaising with underwriters and so forth.</p><p> In many cases, were it not for the adviser, the client would likely either not start the process, or give up part way through. It is well worth it in the end though&hellip;to obtain the reassurance that not only are they insured, but the money they are spending on premiums is money well spent; and if they ever need to make a claim, it would be unusual that they would be denied by the insurer.</p><p> The same cannot be said for those who answer a few questions and get their insurance cover from a direct provider. They will be shocked to learn that the underwriting process is done at the time of the claim, and the odds are much higher that they will have their claim knocked back &ndash; discovering too late, that all the money they have been paying on expensive insurance premiums for years has been a complete waste.</p><p> <strong>  Of course, field underwriting is just one of the many valuable things that an adviser provides a client when they assist them with their insurance needs. Most clients also need help with: </strong></p><li> Knowing what types of cover are most important to them &ndash; life, TPD, trauma, income protection;</li><li> Knowing what levels of cover to put in place;</li><li> Knowing what they can reduce if their budget does not allow for the optimum levels of cover;</li><li> Which insurers to select &ndash; not only choosing the cheapest options but also the right inclusions for their situation;</li><li> How to structure the ownership of their policies so that they can minimise tax payable &ndash; both on the premiums they pay, and also on any payout that they may receive;</li><li> Whether to select level or stepped premiums, agreed value or indemnity, Any or Own-occupation;</li><li> Help them understand the pros and cons of holding insurance via superannuation, considering such things as the harsh conditions of release for TPD;</li><li> Perhaps one of the most valuable things about having an adviser is the ability to call on them when something goes wrong. The adviser will know if the client should make a claim, and will handle the paperwork and liaison with the insurer; and</li><li> When that claim is paid, a good adviser will help ensure the proceeds are received and utilised in the most tax effective way, that will achieve the best outcome for the remaining family. (think lump sum? reversionary pension?  early release? and all the other options that confuse even the healthiest of people.) <br/>  </li><p> And of course, most good insurance advisers will also take the opportunity to ensure that their clients&rsquo; estate planning needs are met; helping them maximise the time they&rsquo;re spending thinking about the unthinkable, and getting wills, testamentary trusts, powers of attorney, health directives and guardianship squared away, so that their legacy is passed on the way they would prefer.</p><p> Some of these things can be researched and learned online if you had the time, but for many consumers the risk of getting it wrong is far too great, and so their adviser&rsquo;s support is invaluable.</p><p> Most consumers don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know about getting insurance cover, and that is our responsibility to educate them about. How can someone make an informed choice when they aren&rsquo;t aware of all their options? When the value of insurance advice is articulated well, either directly by advisers or by their clients and referral partners, people are hard-pressed to argue that they would not benefit from being under the care of a financial planner with insurance experience.</p><p> At this point, we don&rsquo;t know what will happen with insurance commissions. What we do know, is that advisers play a meaningful and incredibly valuable role in helping clients sort out their personal insurances. This role deserves to be rewarded, be that by commissions, or by clients paying a fee. Just like they pay for other things they value.</p><p> <strong>  And therein lies the key&hellip;helping people understand the value of obtaining advice to ensure they are protected. </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re needing some help to refine your pricing model, or to articulate your value proposition, get in touch &ndash; we&rsquo;d love to see if we can help.</p>",

    "title": "Want to Be a CEO's Trusted Advisor? Do These 8 Things",
    "link": "want-to-be-a-ceos-trusted-advisor-do-these-8-things",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Over the past 15 years, I've interviewed more than 1,000 senior corporate executives about their most trusted advisors and strategic suppliers. </strong> I've asked them about who has earned a seat at the table with them and how it was done. I've explored&mdash;from their side of the desk&mdash;the ingredients of great, long-term trusted partnerships with external providers of all stripes.</p><p> <strong>  The following are eight things client executives told me they value and want, over and over again: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. \"Be a trusted advisor to me even when you aren't earning lot of fees.\" </strong></p><p> Put another way, executives are saying, \"My trusted advisors are there for me in flush times and lean times&mdash;through thick and thin.\"</p><p> On the surface, this may sound like clients want to get something for nothing. But that isn't what they mean. I recently interviewed the former CEO of a major manufacturing company who articulated this need very clearly. He described a particular investment bank that had earned trusted advisor status with him:</p><p> \"My company was substantial in size but not the largest in the industry, and we didn't use investment banking services that often. Most of the major banks would only spend time with me when they sensed an imminent, fee-earning transaction. But this particular firm was generous in terms of coming to see me regularly and sharing very insightful views about the markets. Even when we weren't very active, they came to visit. They stayed in touch and built an ongoing relationship. They ended up getting most of our business when we did do some major deals.\"</p><p> Think of it this way: How do you feel about a friend who calls you only when they want something from you?</p><p> <strong>  2. \"Help me think about my problems differently.\" </strong></p><p> This is slightly different than solving a specific problem, which is number 3, below. Sometimes, it means \"Help me define and frame the problem properly.\" It can also mean \"Stimulate and push my thinking about these issues so that when we do address them, we take the right approach.\"</p><p> For example, occasionally a client will contact me and present what they see as a skills development or \"training\" issue. If warranted&mdash;and after I carefully explore their problem with thoughtful questions&mdash;I try to help the executive understand that achieving the higher-order goal they have in mind will require a multifaceted approach that involves other interventions besides just training. They may need to adopt a different go-to-market strategy, break down the silos in their organization, or perhaps implement a key client planning and management process. In short, I help them reframe the situation and think about it differently.</p><p> <strong>  3. \"Help me better understand how to address a specific challenge I'm facing.\" </strong></p><p> Some clients also express this as \"bring me new ideas.\" Yes, clients do want new ideas. But they need to be relevant ideas that illuminate a particular issue they are concerned about and, therefore, help them accomplish their goals.</p><p> One senior client executive told me:</p><p> \"One year we became very focused on improving our ROA, or return on assets. We were lagging our peers on this measure, and the analysts were highlighting it as a weakness. A consulting firm we had worked on and off with came to me and suggested they put together a workshop on best practices for enhancing ROA. They brought some of their experts, and we put a team together as well. They didn't charge us for the session, but it led to a major project for them. That was the catalyst for them to become one of our 'inner circle' firms.\"</p><p> <strong>  4. \"Price is a secondary consideration in choosing someone to work with. Show me other important qualities that I need in a partner.\" </strong></p><p> Clients go on to say: \"Value, perceived risk, the strength of the proposed approach/methodology, industry and company understanding, and organizational fit are more important unless your price is really out of the ballpark.\"</p><p> You may be shaking your head as you read this statement. Not only have I heard this hundreds of times, but it is borne out by other quantitative research into buying habits: price is usually third or even fourth in importance when it comes to selecting a company for a particular need. Here's why:</p><li> It's risky to hire an external provider for an important project. Clients tell me that they carefully balance the risk of failure against differences in price, and they are willing to pay a bit more if they believe one provider will be a less risky choice.</li><li> Clients&mdash;even procurement managers&mdash;do want value. The question is: Have you made a compelling case for your additional value and your higher fee?</li><li> A purchase decision is usually based on multiple criteria that the purchaser tries to balance. Price is only one of many factors. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  5. \"Ask me thoughtful, informed questions based on your deep experience and careful preparation.\" </strong></p><p> Executives go on to say: \"But if you're meeting with me for the very first time, don't just walk in and pepper me with questions. Tell me why you're here, what you'd like to accomplish, and add some value first. Then you can start asking me questions.\"</p><p> What most people think passes for a good question is usually a pretty average one. In workshops, I'll often do an exercise where small groups come up with the questions they'd really like to ask either a prospect or an existing client. We then take some of these, and discuss them as a group and slowly improve and sharpen them until they are really good.</p><p> Often they start with a potential question like this: \"Are you concerned about the new regulation Q that just came out?\" I role play the answer, and simply say \"No.\" End of conversation.</p><p> A better question is, of course, \"What do you think the impact of Regulation Q is going to be?\" Even better would be, \"What changes in policies or procedures are you thinking about making to accommodate Regulation Q?\"</p><p> <strong>  6. \"Help us understand and manage the change that's required.\" </strong></p><p> The products and services a company buys are all used within a broader organizational system. For a new software application to work well, for example, it must mesh and align with existing business processes, human skills and behavior patterns, other IT systems, and so on. Many client executives have told me that advice, insight, and tools to help manage the change around your solutions are extremely valuable.</p><p> There's opportunity, in short, to examine the larger organizational \"ecosystem\" around your solutions and advise your clients on how to make everything work together faster, better, and easier&mdash;to help them, in effect, manage change.</p><p> This was exactly the key insight that Lou Gerstner gleaned at the start of his tenure as IBM's CEO in 1993. At the time, people were clamoring for IBM to be split up into as many as a dozen different businesses. Gerstner had spent four months visiting IBM customers all over the world, and one of their most forceful messages was, \"Don't break yourself up&mdash;instead, help us do a better job of actually using the hardware and software that we buy from you.\"</p><p> That led to a major emphasis on growing the nascent IBM Global Services business, which now generates $60 billion in high-margin revenue from IT services, outsourcing, and consulting.</p><p> <strong>  7. \"Make it easy for us to work with you.\" </strong></p><p> This one should be easy to give to clients, but apparently it's not. The less friction there is in your working relationship, the easier you will make life for your client&mdash;and the happier they will be with your association.</p><p> Here are some ways to make it easy and pleasurable to work with you:</p><li> Write up and share notes of all your meetings within 24 hours.</li><li> Respond rapidly and cheerfully to client requests.</li><li> Don't complain. (One client told me, \"Don't come to me complaining about a problem in working with my organization&mdash;come to me with a recommended solution.\")</li><li> Communicate frequently.</li><li> Anticipate&mdash;point out what may happen and what your plan will be to deal with it, and flag problems immediately to avoid surprises.</li><li> Listen carefully and ask questions before you respond to a client concern or start pointing out how your client has contributed to the problem.</li><li> Offer to do your client's work and unburden them. (Some examples: your client has to send out a communication about your project to their organization&mdash;write the first draft for them; your client has to prepare a plan for their boss&mdash;help them outline it.) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  8. \"Show us that you care and that you're engaged.\" </strong></p><p> Sometimes those old clich&eacute;s still have significance. You may have heard the expression \"A person doesn't care how much you know until they know how much you care.\" I hear stories from clients all the time about service providers who are disengaged, unprepared, and distracted. They ask basic questions they should already know the answers to. They turn proposals in at the very last minute or even late. They don't appear committed.</p><p> You show engagement by:</p><li> Being genuinely interested in and curious about their business and their organization (often shown through the thoughtful questions you ask).</li><li> Demonstrating enthusiasm in your interactions.</li><li> Preparing and doing your homework.</li><li> Being fully present during your meetings and phone calls. (Is your attention 100% in the conversation, or are you thinking ahead to the next meeting or your next deliverable?) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  There are, of course, other useful things client executives tell me when I interview them, but these eight represent some of the most important ideas. </strong></p>",

    "title": "8 Ways to Grow Your Professional Business Without Prospecting",
    "link": "8-ways-to-grow-your-professional-business-without-prospecting",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Practice professionals have relationship-based businesses that lend themselves to internal growth strategies. </strong></p><p> Internal business development strategies focus on retaining clients and building deeper knowledge and engagement, cultivating referrals, and broadening services. Yet, many practice professionals focus more on sales and marketing to acquire new prospects than they do on developing business opportunities with the clients they already have.</p><p> In an article I developed in collaboration with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ticoon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ticoon Technologies  </a> </u> , the following  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ticoon.com/blog-original/2014/9/23/8-strategies-to-grow-your-advisory-practice-without-prospecting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eight strategies were applied to financial advisors  </a> </u> . These same strategies can also be used by a wide range of business professionals who want to grow their practice &ndash; including advisors, accountants, lawyers, consultants, etc.</p><p> <strong>  1. Really know your client. </strong></p><p> The better you know your client and understand their true needs and motivations, the better you can serve them. This is both a challenge to get to know your clients better as human beings, yet also an imperative to pay more attention to organizing and harnessing the massive amount of data that exists within your business about your clients and their habits. Every professional practice needs some kind of customer relationship management strategy including software and processes for managing clients.</p><p> <strong>  2. Understand the lifetime value of your client. </strong></p><p> Smart businesses realize that it&rsquo;s more cost-effective to retain clients than it is to find new ones. The lifetime value of a client is a concept that applies very well to practice professional businesses because of the important role that trust plays at the front end of the relationship. Once the initial trust hurdle is crossed and if that trust is nurtured and maintained over time, then your clients will bring you a continuous stream of new opportunities as their needs grow and evolve.</p><p> <strong>  3. Pay attention to relevance in communications. </strong></p><p> Client communication may be the single most important factor in retaining and growing your business internally. Technology is rapidly changing how and where we communicate and increasing the control clients have over what they receive. Communications are more conversational then ever before and relevance trumps everything in conversations. You need to focus on what your client is interested in and how they want you to communicate it to them. Then you need to deliver on your side of the conversation.</p><p> <strong>  4. Be a quarterback. </strong></p><p> Nothing is simple anymore. Clients have multiple advisors, consultants and service providers &ndash; more choices that ever before. Yet, simplicity is still a virtue for many people and any way you can manage complexity and/or coordinate among service providers is added value for your clients. Plus, stepping up and playing the quarterback role puts you squarely in a position to influence the plays that are called.</p><p> <strong>  5. Get personal. </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;re in a relationship business. Your clients have chosen to work with you because they know you, they like you and they trust you. So, get to know them, like them and trust them too. And their families. And their friends. Getting to know your clients personally helps you understand them and support them in achieving their goals. And you will be the person they refer when others in their network need your help.</p><p> <strong>  6. Engage your clients online. </strong></p><p> The majority of your clients are online and that&rsquo;s only going to increase over time. They&rsquo;re getting their news online and being entertained online. If you&rsquo;re not sharing relevant news or a good laugh or something inspiring with them online, you can be sure of one thing: someone else is. Engage your clients in online social networks and stop pretending you can&rsquo;t afford the time. You can&rsquo;t afford not to make the time.</p><p> <strong>  7. Demonstrate value. </strong></p><p> Long gone are the days when we worked for one employer for 30 years, let alone stay with one service provider or practice professional. And technology is changing so quickly that with each passing year there are alternative digital ways to get traditional services. So, demonstrate value for your clients, day in and day out. Remind them regularly why they should want to continue to do business with you &ndash; with YOU and not with someone or something else. Never, ever take your clients for granted.</p><p> <strong>  8. Provide full service. </strong></p><p> You already have a stable of clients whose trust you&rsquo;ve earned. As your business matures, there are many growth opportunities that can come from broadening the range of services your offer. If you know your clients and are paying close attention both to what they are telling you in conversations and what the data surrounding their habits are telling you, it will be revealed exactly how to expand your service offering and grow your practice.</p> ",

    "link": "what-is-wealth",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  What does wealth mean to you? </strong> Quick, top-of-the-mind answer.</p><p> Some people think wealth is about money or being rich in material possessions. For my purpose I desire to keep it simple. You are rich with an abundance of friends, love, family, experiences, and joy. How about being wealthy because you have an education, great health and plenty of free time? That's wealth to me. Wealth to me is human intimacy and connection.</p><p> <strong>  When I ask men and women what wealth is to them, I always get different answers. </strong> Men typically answer with a goal in mind (i.e., lake house, college funding) and women will tend to answer with words like freedom and security. These are very different answers to the same question. So what does this tell us? Well, for starters it makes it clear that women look at wealth in terms of life values, not just the value of the wealth, highlighting the significance of the emerging values-based conversation.</p><p> <strong>  Like success, there can be many definitions for wealth. </strong> I personally love the word abundance. It's become quite a catchword lately. Since the debut of the movie <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DDOWN8M/ref=atv_feed_catalog?ref_=imdbref_tt_pv_vi_aiv_1&amp;tag=imdbtag_tt_pv_vi_aiv-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Secret  </u> </a> in 2006, the idea of scarcity versus abundance has exploded. Of course, these concepts have been around for ages, but they continue to receive wide interest and appeal even today. In basic terms, scarcity is living in the mindset of lack, the fear of never having enough or losing it all. On the flip side, there is abundance, living the life you love, always having and creating more.</p><p> <strong>  Do you live your life in abundance or scarcity? </strong> Do you believe that there are enough resources for everyone or do you feel there is a limited supply? How do your beliefs influence your practice? How does your mindset affect your clients?</p><p> In her book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=the+soul+of+money&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;index=stripbooks&amp;hvadid=19931784797&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=14364286748779421057&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_83etjvntzk_e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Soul of Money  </u> </a> , global activist, fundraiser, and speaker Lynne Twist introduces an alternative to this scarcity and abundance consciousness and demonstrates how we can replace feelings of scarcity, guilt, and burden with experiences of sufficiency, freedom, and purpose. She writes, \"Once we let go of scarcity, we discover the surprising truth of sufficiency. By sufficiency, I don't mean a quantity of anything. Sufficiency isn't two steps up from poverty or one step short of abundance. Sufficiency is&hellip;a knowing that there is enough, and that we are enough.\" She goes on, \"When we live in the context of sufficiency, we find a natural freedom and integrity. We engage in life from a sense of our own wholeness rather than a desperate longing to be complete. We feel naturally called to share the resources that flow through our lives-our time, our money, our wisdom, our energy, at whatever level those resources flow-to serve our highest commitments.\" Wow. What would happen if you engaged this approach with yourself, your family, and your clients? I'll give you a hint: intimacy.</p><p> I've become convinced that so many wealth professionals that I have met have the desire to create intimacy, but because they are knee-deep in running a dynamic practice, they don't know what to do. Let's see, you manage hundreds of clients, you build portfolios, stay in tune to the markets and the laws. You provide advice on tax questions and estate questions. You meet with and stay on top of too many product providers. You answer servicing questions about updated zip codes and going paperless. You prospect and you run a team. Oh, and you have a personal life, too.</p><p> <strong>  Think about where you are in your life and your practice. </strong> How would your employees or clients describe you? What is your identity? Do they know you intimately? What do you do to foster more meaningful interactions with them?</p><p> Even better, who are your clients? What are their dreams? Are you tuned in to their needs, wants, and concerns?</p><p> <strong>  Take the time to ask yourself these questions, you'll be glad you did! </strong></p>",

You need to enjoy the walk toward the sun without falling into the despair of the gap between you and your goals.  Well social media has a very real gap and many financial advisors have not only slipped off the edge, but have fallen deep into a crevice at the bottom of the gap.  My job is to wedge them out and get them back to enjoying the actual journey.</p><p> Accenture, a leading organization which provides management consulting, technology and outsourcing services,  <u>  published a report titled, &ldquo;Closing the Gap:  How Tech-Savvy Advisors Can Regain Investor Trust </u> &rdquo; where we learn about Generation D &mdash; the D standing for Digital.  This isn&rsquo;t a particular block of individuals born between this date and that one, but rather a melting pot representation of the more than 75 million individuals with a significant amount of assets who have a broad adoption of technology.</p><p> On page 7 of the report, I need you to pay extra special attention to this:  &ldquo;Consistent and effective use of digital tools and social channels is becoming increasingly necessary for financial advisors to remain relevant to Gen D investors who already represent a large and viable market segment.&rdquo;  This is the gap!!!  </p><p> Danger Will Robinson!</p><p> If you are one of the advisors who is not being consistent with your use of social media and digital tools, you are running an enormous risk of being irrelevant&hellip;and this is hard to bounce back from with Digital D, folks.

    "link": "5-tips-to-build-intimacy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There&rsquo;s nothing I hate more than intimacy.</p><p> Okay, maybe that&rsquo;s not entirely true.</p><p> There&rsquo;s nothing that scares me more than intimacy.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I can tell you every detail about everything I&rsquo;ve ever done without breaking a sweat. And for a long time, I assumed that I meant I was open, available, and willing to be loved.</p><p> Well, I was wrong. &lt;cue obnoxious buzzer sound&gt;</p><p> So it came as a surprise that the more my partner would love me, the more I would retreat. &ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo; I wondered. &ldquo;Why is it that I&rsquo;m finally getting what I want in a relationship and yet I&rsquo;ve never been more freaked out?&rdquo;</p><p> Sometimes getting what you want means giving up what you don&rsquo;t want. Sounds simple enough in theory, but in reality, it sucks. After all, embracing intimacy means more than sex, a shared history, or a mutual dislike of olives.  For me, it meant giving up my protective walls that had kept me safe for so long.</p><p> So how did I navigate this painful transition in order to truly be open to love?</p><p> <strong>  I FOLLOWED THESE 5 TIPS: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Accept The Assignment. </strong></p><p> People show up in our life for a reason. Maybe they teach us how to love, maybe they teach us how to set boundaries, or maybe they simply teach us how to build Ikea furniture. Whatever the reason may be, it&rsquo;s your job to accept the assignment that&rsquo;s coming your way. Ask yourself, &ldquo;What is this person teaching me about myself that I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned without them?&rdquo; When you view others as spiritual assignments for growth rather than as answers to your problems, you&rsquo;re able to let go of the idea that they will &ldquo;complete you.&rdquo; This fosters intimacy and manages expectations.</p><p> <strong>  2. See The Present Rather Than The Potential. </strong></p><p> Intimacy involves both people being present to what&rsquo;s actually happening, not what they&rsquo;d like to happen. It involves accepting that you&rsquo;re dating a human with flaws and not a house that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;fixer upper.&rdquo; Sure, it&rsquo;s nice to pretend that he doesn&rsquo;t have a weird obsession with his cat or that his unemployment for the last 5 years is &ldquo;temporary,&rdquo; but at the end of the day, you need to be able to ask yourself if you love this person or you love the person you want them to be. Intimacy requires that both people live in reality (and like it).</p><p> <strong>  3. Learn To Love Alone Time. </strong></p><p> When I was a codependent mess, being alone felt like failure. I preferred the constant validation of someone else&rsquo;s company, even if I didn&rsquo;t enjoy his company. But spending more time alone and developing hobbies helped me to feel complete without another person. Instead of defining intimacy like a kid watching a Disney movie, define it as a self-sufficient adult. True intimacy is &ldquo;needing&rdquo; someone because you love them, rather than loving them because you need them. Feeling safe, secure, and sane on your own will make it easier to give and receive love.</p><p> <strong>  4. Own. Your. Shit. </strong></p><p> Intimacy with another requires you to get intimate with yourself first. That means, learning to honor your strengths and accept your flaws. Do the work, quit running away, and stop blaming others. Intimacy requires courage. And courage is a decision, not a feeling. Cleaning up your side of the street paves the way to true honesty and intimacy with yourself and others.</p><p> <strong>  5. Give To Give (Not To Get). </strong></p><p> True intimacy is fostered by those who give out of compassion, empathy, and mutual respect. In an unhealthy relationship, giving is used as a tool to get something in return. Avoid the quid pro quo mentality by giving from a place of presence and abundance, (not just so he&rsquo;ll take out the trash). This simple shift not only helps you to identify what you want in a partnership, but the gifts you have to offer.</p><p> Achieving intimacy isn&rsquo;t solely about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/why-you-arent-attracting-the-right-people\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   attracting the right partner  </a> </u> , it&rsquo;s about creating the space for one in your life. To make anything work, you have to start with you.</p><p> <strong>  THE TAKEAWAY: </strong></p><p> Know yourself, trust yourself, and love yourself.</p><p> And from that place of wholeness, you&rsquo;re better prepared to cultivate true intimacy.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Some time ago, my dad was unemployed and picking up contract work when it was made available to him. In order to procure this contract work, he had to sign up with a few security agencies. </strong> In doing so, he eventually landed a full-time gig supervising security guards and investigators for a major supermarket chain. The nature of his employment agreement with this chain was that he was technically employed by the security firm but assigned to the supermarket as a worker- so no company perks, benefits or official employer-employee relationship. This supermarket is well-known for their concepts around creating democratized workforces that enjoy their work, have a passion for what they do and are rewarded in innumerable ways for such efforts. I&rsquo;ll let you ponder that one.</p><p> Despite the purported mindful leadership at the helm, my father had no direction of what was right or wrong- where it concerned his employment. <strong>  What do I mean? </strong>  As a supervisor, his job was to watch the cameras for any potential for theft. He also supervised a staff of investigators and store detectives. In addition, he was required to walk the store to observe customer behavior ensuring the overall security of the premises. When the store closed at night, he was responsible for making sure all remaining customers exited in a timely fashion so he could continue his nightly closing procedure. At least weekly, there would be a customer that felt his presence was &ldquo;harassing&rdquo; when he would pleasantly ask the customer to proceed to the nearest register, because they decided to shop for food at 9:50 p.m. and the store was closing in ten minutes. There would be one or two customers who tried to steal goods under his watch and he would act accordingly. There were managers that would gossip about him saying he &ldquo;had an attitude&rdquo; because he didn&rsquo;t spend time chatting with them on the floor. In light of all of this, no complaint was ever logged with the agency he was employed by  and so he continued on doing his job. Yet there were very different views and perceptions about whether he was doing his job,</p><p> <strong>  Until&hellip; </strong></p><p> One day, he is told don&rsquo;t show up to his normal store. Manager X didn&rsquo;t want him there any longer, so the agency pulled him- no questions asked. The agency&rsquo;s response was &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a tough store to work in and lots of guys have had issues with that manager- we&rsquo;ll just reassign you.&rdquo;  He was reassigned to a new store, things were great there until some months in- he receives notice that another manager wrote to the regional head to say that: &ldquo;a customer allegedly complained about him harassing them at closing- suggesting that he should not be employed by any of the supermarket&rsquo;s other locations.&rdquo; He was never called by the agency to find out his side of the story. He had to proactively seek out answers- which was met with the following answer &ldquo;we have a lot of issues with the managers there- we&rsquo;ll get you working with some other clients.&rdquo;</p><p> The problem with this entire situation is the employee-whether my dad or someone else is always in limbo. The supermarket and the agency operated under separate and very different standards of operation- which was confusing to the people working for either of them. The agency signed and enforced a contract with this company that basically prevented them from defending their employees. Their unwillingness to get to the bottom of the alleged complaint against my dad (which affected his employment) told me that they were far more concerned about tarnishing the business relationship than retaining him as a contractor. They set the precedent that, anytime any alleged customer complaint was filed or if a manager disliked any contractor they sent- the worker could expect to be ousted from that location.</p><p> <strong>  He who fails to plan, plans to fail&hellip; </strong></p><p> The biggest mistake they made in this partnership was not planning for a collaboration that ensured the seamless integration of workers whether directly employed or via the agency. You cannot have a successful workforce outsourcing situation where the rules are different for how employees work and are treated because of the nature of their employment. Since this company was quite possibly the biggest account they had-therefore contributing to a large portion of their revenue; the agency was unwilling to stand up for their workers when these issues arose. In return, they also had a hard time retaining people with this account because of the treatment.</p><p> The terms of any workforce outsourcing agreement need to be true to how each entity operates, while also ensuring the fair and consistent treatment of employees. Each party has to be willing to be flexible in their terms-as the relationship continues, to allow for tweaks to the service level agreement in place. As a vendor, your primary focus cannot be the money you will make on the account. You also have to seriously consider your ability to hire and retain the talent you will need to sustain the account.</p><p> <strong>  Here are some other items to consider when entering a workforce outsourcing contract: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1) Did you ask about the company culture?  </strong> You need to. Understanding and deciding how your workforce will blend with the existing client workforce is an important consideration for how successful you will be.</p><p> <strong>  2) Creating a conflict mediation practice.  </strong> Just like the client values their employees, you do too (hopefully). If you do, it is important that anyone you hire knows how they can resolve an issue should one arise. There should also be a collective agreement between you and the client of how these issues will be resolved.</p><p> <strong>  3) How do you socialize the onboarding of new staff? </strong>  Will the client simply have people show up to work on Monday or will there be a formal meet and greet? Whether an employee is a contractor or directly employed by the company, it is important for management to communicate the acquisition of new talent and communicate the expectations for how everyone will work together.</p><p> <strong>  4) What can you do to make &ldquo;contractors&rdquo; feel like they are a part of the company? </strong> Can you afford to offer contractors a discount or pro-rated benefits? Making people feel more like an employee even if the relationship is temporary, can increase productivity and improve their engagement in the business and operations.</p><p> Customers don&rsquo;t care who employees work for when it comes to patronizing your business. They know that they expect to have a great experience and if something should go wrong- they will be provided with a consistent and speedy resolution. Spending time in the beginning to develop and incorporate some basic talent management practices into your workforce outsourcing agreement will help to assimilate these new people into the current workforce seamlessly.</p><p> Ready to develop or improve your talent management strategy for your business?  <u>  <a href=\"http://talentthinkinnovations.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Contact me  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PMPhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bruce Harpham  </a> </u></p><p> Quality separates the professional from the amateur. The commitment to produce on time is admirable and important. Yet, it is not enough. Whether you are managing a multi-million dollar IT project or managing your career, a commitment to quality makes a big difference.</p><p> When I think about quality practices, manufacturing and safety are the first concepts that come to mind. When manufacturing firms like Toyota embraced quality, lives AND money were saved (though Toyota&rsquo;s recent experience shows that quality is a never ending activity). Delivering quality is one of those cases where we can see Adam Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo; at work.</p><p> <strong>  Improving Profits Through Quality: AtlantiCare Case Study </strong></p><p> Consider the following quality case study reported in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.europeanceo.com/business-and-management/total-quality-management-three-case-studies-from-around-the-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   European CEO  </a> </u>  in 2014:</p><li> New Jersey-based healthcare provider AtlantiCare has 5,000 employees</li><li> Pre-quality improvement profit: $280 million</li><li> Post-quality improvement program profit: $650 million</li><li> &ldquo;AtlantiCare decided to ensure all new employees understood this quality culture from the onset. At orientation, staff now receive a crash course in the company&rsquo;s performance excellence framework &ndash; a management system that organises the firm&rsquo;s processes into five key areas: quality, customer service, people and workplace, growth and financial performance. As employees rise through the ranks, this emphasis on improvement follows, so managers can operate within the company&rsquo;s tight-loose-tight process management style.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> The above example attracts my interest on several points. The company&rsquo;s improvement shows that there is still significant room to improve quality in many sectors of the economy. As the services sector continues to grow (in the US, services are 79% of GDP; in Canada, services are 69% of GDP and, in the UK, services are 78% according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_sector_composition\" target=\"_blank\">   Wikipedia  </a> </u> ), it is vital to improve the productivity of the sector. In the public sector, quality improvements can translate to more services per tax dollar.</p><p> Whether you are managing a large project or your own work, we can benefit from improving our quality practices. The following four principles and techniques are tried and true ways to improve quality in a variety of environments. If you are looking for a way to improve your productivity, improving quality is an excellent strategy to pursue.</p><p> <strong>  1. Define quality clearly </strong></p><p> In the management literature, there are several definitions to quality. For example, the Six Sigma school of thought developed at Motorola and General Electric defines quality as minimizing the number of defects or errors. That&rsquo;s a definition well suited to manufacturing and heavy industry. New approaches to quality emphasize customer satisfaction. In this view, quality is only achieved if the end customer or user can effectively use the product.</p><p> <strong>  Action:  </strong> take the time to define quality for your current work. If you select customer satisfaction as the definition, come up with an assessment tool (e.g. a survey).</p><p> <strong>  2. Use the Pareto Rule to choose which quality problem to solve </strong></p><p> Made famous by Tim Ferriss in  <u>  <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The 4-Hour Workweek  </a> </u>  and several other recent books, the Pareto Rule is a valuable concept with many applications in the business world. The rule states that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts (e.g. 20% of the sales staff generate 80% of the revenues). In this context, the Pareto Rule is helpful in identifying causes of poor quality.</p><p> For example, let&rsquo;s say that you manage an online banking application for a large bank. As millions of people use the application every day, you will likely receive a large quantity of comments and feedback regarding the application. Start by organizing the comments into a small number of categories (e.g. system stability, mobile app performance and security). Once you have those categories in place, you may notice that the majority of defects fall into the security category. The Pareto Rule suggests that addressing customer security concerns will improve quality as measured by customer satisfaction.</p><p> <strong>  Action:  </strong> Organize defect information into categories and identify the top cause of quality problems. Applying your resources to improve the most significant cause of problems is an excellent quality approach.</p><p> <strong>  3.  Choose a quality tool </strong></p><p> In project management (e.g. PMBOK Guide) and other management approaches, there are numerous quality tools and methods. These tools include check sheets, control charts, Cause-and-effect diagrams and the Pareto Rule referenced above. Depending on your circumstances,  some or all of these tools will be relevant. If you have never used any of the tools, I encourage readers to start with the check sheet.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you are running a technology project to improve customer service at an eCommerce company like Amazon. As you build and test new capabilities, you may be asked (or simply wonder) how the project is improving customer service. One way to improve customer service is to improve the consistency of the customer experience. For example, you can build a check list that describes what happens when a customer places an order: they receive an order confirmation email within 30 minutes of ordering, a shipment status email within 48 hours and so forth. You can then choose random transactions from the project and run them through the checklist.</p><p> <strong>  Action: </strong>  Checklists improve the performance of aircraft pilots, surgeons, and other professionals. Choose a task that you perform each week (or monthly) and build a check list for it. The quality of your work will improve as you use the checklist.</p><p> <strong>  Tip: </strong> For further reading and inspiration on how checklists save lives and improve results, I recommend reading  <u>  <a href=\"http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right  </a> </u>  by Atul Gawande.</p><p> <strong>  4. Make quality easy to improve </strong></p><p> Complexity is often the enemy of improvement and effectiveness. The more variables and issues we face in our work, the more difficult it becomes to deliver work. As you build your quality improvement efforts, remember to keep it simple. This quality concept is especially important when you are building quality practices for others to use.</p><p> How can quality be made easy in the health care context? As Atul Gawande points out, using checklists is one approach. In a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122226184\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NPR article  </a> </u> , Gawande suggests a checklist for surgeons include items such as &ldquo;we just made sure that the checklist had some basic things: Make sure that blood is available, antibiotics are there.&rdquo; These improvements do not require new technology or other costly changes and they may seem obvious to some readers. However, health professionals face a great deal of stress and long working hours &ndash; simply assuming they will remember everything is not realistic.</p><p> My favorite example of making quality easy to improve? Introduce yourself!</p><p> When introductions were made before a surgery, Gawande says, the average number of complications and deaths dipped by 35 percent. ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122226184\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NPR  </a> </u> )</p><p> <strong>  Action: </strong> as you learn about the power of quality improvements, it is easy to get carried away with the options. Start with a simple change first to show the benefits of quality. Once that change is implemented, you will have enhanced credibility to implement other quality improvements.</p><p> <strong>  Tip: </strong>  For personal improvement, I recommend the  <u>  <a href=\"http://tinyhabits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tiny Habits  </a> </u>  program developed by Dr BJ Fogg (thanks to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/about/about-ramit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ramit Sethi  </a> </u>  for introducing me to Fogg).</p>",

    "content": "<p> The workplace is a healthy mix of many generations. We have Baby Boomers who are nearing the ends of their careers and Millennials&mdash;or Generation Y&mdash; whose careers are just beginning. <strong>  But, these are not the only two generations in our organizations. </strong> Yet, when looking at news articles dealing Millennials and Baby Boomers tend to steal the limelight. These reports would lead us to believe that these are the only generations in the work world today. Of course, they're not.</p><p> Because of this, Generation X often is overshadowed and unheard, yet they are an integral part of the workforce and deserve to be included. This is also the perspective of Mary Donohue&rsquo;s Huffington Post article, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/millennials-_b_5239628.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Why Gen X Is Unhappy and Hates Working  </a> </u> .&rdquo; While she thinks it&rsquo;s wise to be studying the up and coming generation (Millennials) and the retirement habits and trends of Baby Boomers, she notes that fewer resources are being spent on Generation X.</p><p> &ldquo;&hellip;to build your company you need to also starting thinking about what is happening with the Gen X now,&rdquo; writes Donohue. She then goes on to say that, while Gen X has been studied the least out of the generations in the workplace, that doesn&rsquo;t make them any less important. &ldquo;The closer these workers get to 50 the more their knowledge becomes invaluable to your organization and to your customers,&rdquo; says Donohue.</p><p> The message is loud and clear&mdash; <strong>  Generation X is crucial to the success of our organizations, yet we aren&rsquo;t treating them like it. </strong> While we focus on making sure Baby Boomers are prepared for retirement&mdash;and we are prepared for their exodus&mdash;and we try to understand the idiosyncrasies of Millennials, we may be overlooking those equally valuable employees we have who fall in between. Their knowledge and skills, like Donohue says, are invaluable, and to ignore them would be counterproductive to business growth.</p><p> In other words, we need to be more inclusive of all of the generations in our workplaces.</p><p> What is the best way to remedy this problem?</p><p> First, make sure you&rsquo;re not ignoring your Gen Xers. They have significant knowledge of your business that you&rsquo;ll need once the Baby Boomers begin to leave. When they do, these Gen Xers will be next in line to help grow your organization and well positioned to mentor your Millennial staff members. It makes sense to start engaging with them now!</p><p> Next, talk to your Generation X employees. Learn what they like most about your company, if they think they&rsquo;re being listened to or if they feel their needs are being met. The best way to know if you&rsquo;re being inclusive of your employees is to open up the dialogue and ask. Ask how things are going for them. Ask for their input on where they think the company is going. Be inclusive of their ideas and their input.</p><p> Inclusivity isn&rsquo;t for just one generation&mdash;it&rsquo;s for employees of all ages and stages of life!</p>",

    "link": "old-seo-vs-new-seo-content-marketing-for-advisors",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/old-seo-vs-new-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   part 1  </a> </u>  of this series, we looked briefly at an overview of what  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-search-engine-optimization-seo-and-why-do-i-need-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Search Engine Optimization  </a> </u>  used to be versus what Search Engine Optimization is now. <strong>  One thing that we know for sure is that what used to work, doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. </strong> One of the biggest game changers in SEO over the years has been  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing  </a> </u> . For some background on content marketing, and how it relates to Financial and Insurance Advisors,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click here  </a> </u>  before reading on.</p><p> The old SEO was largely focused on finding target keywords and then building an SEO campaign around those focused keywords. It was understood that search crawlers looked for keywords in website content and that it was most effective to use those keywords in titles, meta-descriptions and the first 100 words of an article. Content was created and those keywords were inserted in all the right places. If you were an Advisor that was early to market, and there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of competition around your keywords, chances are you would see some success.  Traditional SEO, focused more on trying to rank high using target keywords and less on trying to fulfill the needs and requirements of the people using these keywords to make searches.</p><p> SEO used to be a strategy that was fairly easy to take advantage of. It didn&rsquo;t take rocket science to trick Google into ranking a poorly put together website high on their search results page.</p><p> But then&hellip;</p><p> Online competition increased, consumer awareness improved, and in came the new SEO.</p><p> <strong>  Unlike old SEO strategies, the new SEO puts focus on value, quality and engagement. </strong> Keyword research has become far less important than good content marketing and creation. Today&rsquo;s SEO is in large part a combination of creating and sharing great content. It has become about communicating with your current and future customers without trying to promote your Advisor services, a method of helping your prospects by teaching instead of selling. If you are creating valuable content focused on questions and topics that are relevant to your business and your client&rsquo;s and prospect&rsquo;s interests and challenges, they should naturally contain the keywords for which you want to rank.</p><p> Google is now looking for more active engagement with your site&rsquo;s content. This is why unique and valuable content is more effective then ever. High quality content offers Advisor&rsquo;s clients and prospects unique and applicable information that they can engage with, like and share. If more people are liking and sharing your content, you have a better chance of getting ranked higher in search engines than if you were to solely target the &lsquo;&rsquo;right&rsquo;&rsquo; keywords.  Additionally, creating high quality and unique traffic helps to drive more <u>  t  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/blogging-tips-for-financial-advisors-the-top-3-reasons-why-every-advisor-should-be-blogging-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   raffic to your website, drives client engagement and leads, and has a long-term effect for your web presence  </a>  . </u></p><p> So, what are 2 of the most important things Advisors should be doing to get results?</p><li> <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/blogging-tips-for-financial-advisors-the-top-3-reasons-why-every-advisor-should-be-blogging-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blog  </u>  , blog blog!  </a> The new SEO is all about great content.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  A new mobile app called   <u>   <a href=\"http://meerkatapp.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Meerkat   </a>  </u>   was all the rage at the recent South by Southwest (  <u>   <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    sxsw.com   </a>  </u>  ) tech startup conference. </strong> The app enables users to stream live video to their followers, either at their whim, or by scheduling a video for a later time. All notifications from Meerkat are transmitted on Twitter, and users can set up alerts that notify them when one of their Twitter connections has a live video underway.</p><p> The immediacy of Meerkat's live streaming, and its lack of video archiving, seem to be the way things are headed on the Web. If you miss a \"live\" video, there's no replay or archiving capability. The videos disappear into the ether. Meerkat seems to have tapped into the same verve that got Mark Cuban excited when he started  <u>  Cyberdust </u> , an instant-messaging (IM) app that leaves no records of messages sent. </p><p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Present-Shock-When-Everything-Happens/dp/1591844762/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410788268&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=present+shock\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now  </a> </u> , author Douglas Rushkoff describes how society&rsquo;s framework for perceiving events evolved from forward-looking futurism, to an almost obsessive preoccupation with what&rsquo;s happening right now. Rushkoff explains this phenomenon of &ldquo;narrative collapse.&rdquo; Live-streaming video and vanishing instant messages represent the most recent manifestation of this narrative collapse.</p><p> In his latest blog article,  <u>  <a href=\"http://stocktwits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   StockTwits  </a> </u>  CEO and angel investor,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.howardlindzon.com/live-streaming-video-twitter-periscope-and-meerkat/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Howard Lindzon  </a> </u> , intimates that he is \"making ... notes and organizing ... product thoughts,\" as he reflects on Meerkat's potential to disrupt financial markets. He seems to envision a financial media product idea that \"won't be kind to cable and incumbents.\" Given his product development and entrepreneurial experience, I'm sure he has something interesting in mind.</p><p> When I think about Meerkat's impact on finance, my mind goes in a different direction. I spent twenty years on Wall Street, where analysts respond to real-time, stock-moving events by doing a \"break-in\" call on the firm-wide intercom system, known as the \"hoot 'n' holler.\" A product manager might give the firm's salesforce a head's up, with an announcement that \"Brian Egger will have a break-in call in two minutes.\" </p><p> Sometimes these calls reflect an analyst's \"quick take\" on corporate or industry news. In other instances, an analyst might report findings from a management meeting or industry conference. These verbal comments would be followed by a short \"flash\" note that would be disseminated to the firm's clients.  </p><p> The idea of live-streaming video trumps Wall Street's somewhat clumsy efforts to deliver real-time commentary. The Street's current process requires analysts to script their thoughts, await an opening on the hoot-'n'-holler to break in, and then wait for the firm's busy traders and salespeople to distill their comments and convey them by phone or IM to investor clients.</p><p> Wall Street firms have to ensure that analyst comments, and their written-form post-scripts, comply with internal and regulatory rules. The compliance rules make for a protracted process. With more financial market conversations occurring in \"real\" real time, facilitated by tools like Twitter, StockTwits, and Meerkat, research analysts may soon face a new challenge to their traditional role as \"on the scene\" market commentators. The fact that Wall Street must devote much of its time to \"archiving\" all that is said and written by analysts is another reason why the brokerage community is out-of-step with the latest developments in online communications. </p>",

    "link": "boomers-get-social-best-because-they-have-relationship-building-experience",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> You&rsquo;ve often heard me say that social media should be more about building real relationships than just &lsquo;friending/liking/following&rsquo; a lot of people. That&rsquo;s why I think Baby Boomers &lsquo;get&rsquo; social media better than those who were born into it&mdash;because they&rsquo;re old hats at building person-to-person relationships. And that&rsquo;s not just because I&rsquo;m one of them!</p><p> <strong>  We Learned &lsquo;The Basics&rsquo; Early </strong></p><p> Seventy-six million American children were born between 1945 and 1964, and in our formative years, the most advanced piece of communication technology was the rotary dial telephone. Neighbors still talked over fences, joined in-person social clubs, read the newspaper that was delivered to their door and wrote letters to each other (real, honest-to-goodness letters written on paper and sent out in envelopes with stamps).</p><p> These kinds of things might seem old-fashioned and out of touch by younger generations, but I think that upbringing actually gives Boomers the advantage in building social relationships. Why? Because we learned the basics of face-to-face interaction with people at an early age: being polite, shaking hands, looking people in the eye and listening. Those skills were drummed into us from the time we could walk. First by parents, and then reinforced from grandparents, aunts and uncles, siblings, neighbors, teachers, and coaches. There were no &lsquo;preschool&rsquo; classes to teach children how to behave with one another. Mom often stayed home and prepared children for kindergarten with playdates and other family and social activities. Most of what we learned about interacting with people we learned before we were six!</p><p> <strong>  We Understand What Friendship Really Means </strong></p><p> Having a friend as a child in my day meant actually playing with someone in the sandbox, having sleepovers and birthday parties, or riding bikes to the nearest mom-and-pop grocer to spend nickels and dimes on penny candy. If you were lucky you kept those friends through school and/or college and deepened the relationship with them over time. There were no video games. There was no Internet. We played outside, got dirty and learned teamwork!</p><p> As we got older, those relationship-building skills translated to working relationships with superiors, peers and customers. We instinctively know how to talk &lsquo;with&rsquo; each other, so we gravitate toward face-to-face networking situations.</p><p> <strong>  We Take Technology a Little Slower (and that can be a Good Thing) </strong></p><p> We weren&rsquo;t born into today&rsquo;s technology, but we&rsquo;ve seen lots of technological changes in our time, including the birth of personal computers, the Internet, cell phones and social media. Up until the last decade, technology moved slower for us, and that causes us to be a little slower to adopt new gizmos and gadgets. However, we bring our person-to-person social skills with us, so we don&rsquo;t have to be taught how to #justbenice on new digital channels.</p><p> Once Boomers &lsquo;get&rsquo; how to use social, we&rsquo;re better at listening, adjusting to situations on the fly, and reaching out in various ways to take relationships to the next level. It&rsquo;s has to do with the way we were wired from the beginning&hellip; but more importantly it&rsquo;s about experience building relationships and learning how to adapt, that comes to anyone with age and the passage of time.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a shame that so many who follow us didn&rsquo;t learn the same basic people skills we learned as children. Younger generations have a technological advantage in that they were immersed in digital tech from birth, but a tech advantage isn&rsquo;t a people-skills advantage. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s my mission to re-teach those concepts to people and business today. It&rsquo;s important that we don&rsquo;t forget or gloss over them because in the end, it&rsquo;s all about building human-to-human relationships, no matter where technology take us.x</p>",

    "title": "Behavioral Finance and Beyond Fear and Greed",
    "link": "behavioral-finance-and-beyond-fear-and-greed",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Understanding the gap in what we know we should do and why we don&rsquo;t do it is essentially known as behavioral finance. Having had many economics classes I have been puzzled at what some people call what a rational person would do. And who is this rational person? Harry Markowitz a Nobel prize-winning economist didn&rsquo;t follow the rational side of what his own research showed that others should do. Fortunately people like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, Schlomo Benartzi, Dan Ariely and Daniel Crosby have studied more on why we don&rsquo;t do what we should do. Dr. Crosby writes:</p><p> &ldquo;We as investors are always searching to make the best investment possible, to beat the market and try and secure for ourselves untold fortunes in the process. What few understand though is that all along the way, we are subject to emotional traps that make this difficult for the average investor and we actually end up doing much worse than average. For the twenty years ending 12/31/2013 the S&amp;P 500 averaged 8.21% a year but the average equity investor earned a market return of a mere 4.25%. This emotion fueled gap between market returns and investor returns is often the difference between being able to retire or not&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Behavioral Finance and Beyond Fear and Greed </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at the state of Illinois pension woes. Pension funds typically use professional Actuaries and institutional money managers. Surely these people with all of their knowledge would do the rational thing in managing the pension. However, that is not what happened. Few people enjoy the act of saving. It is often perceived as a loss of what you could do with the dollars today. Politicians have their constituents demanding funding for today&rsquo;s needs and desires. Saving money for those who are delivering services is not a priority to these people.</p><p> Rather than saving more and assuming a more conservative rate of return why not target a higher rate of return and save less? Do you prefer to spend money today rather than save it for something in the future? Unfortunately Illinois&rsquo; hoped-for rates of return did not happen. I would argue that those hoped-for returns were highly improbable and came with their own level of risk. Wouldn&rsquo;t a rational person understand the risks and have a backup plan Have you calculated your own risks such as investments, losing your job, becoming disabled, etc.?</p><p> Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Thinking Fast and Slow&rdquo; changed my life. Essentially he says that there are times when we need to slow down and think more rather than react or jump to conclusions. There are other times when reacting is a positive thing. Knowing when to switch from one thought process to another is key.</p><p> <strong>  Behavioral finance and following the herd </strong></p><p> Herd behavior is when we follow the crowd. Often there&rsquo;s comfort in being in the pack. There&rsquo;s even a song lyric &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in with the in crowd&rdquo;. Companies know this and often advertise that they are the number one in their category. They hope that you will find it comforting to be in the &ldquo;in crowd&rdquo;. Have you done that? Do you know if the crowd is right? In the Poseidon Adventure, one of my favorite movies, the eventual survivors tell several passerby&rsquo;s why they are going the wrong way. However those passerby&rsquo;s decided not to listen to logic but to follow the crowd to their peril.</p><p> <strong>  Behavioral finance and recency bias </strong></p><p> We often focus on recent events. Ebola has been replaced by ISIS (ISIL). We tend to overweight what has happened to us recently. When the market is good we tend to believe it will continue forever. When the market is bad we tend to believe that it will be bad forever. When looking at investments many people tend to look at what has happened recently. As a qualified investment advisor representative investment companies regularly try to sell to me in an effort to sell to you. Often I hear we were a top performer in the last 12 months. Should I run and tell my clients about this fact? Does that indicate luck or skill? What evidence do I have that over performance will continue?</p><p> I know that if I flip a coin 10 times I may get 10 heads in a row. However I know that the probability is 50-50 and that if I continue flipping the coin long enough it will come back to that average. If it does not I know that there have been some shenanigans going on with the coin. Should I mention Bernie made off at this point?</p><p> <strong>  How can you use behavioral finance to your advantage </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with helping you to save. Are you saving enough for your retirement? Are you saving enough for your other goals? Do you have plans in place if you&rsquo;re unemployed, disabled or a key family member is the tragic car wreck story on the evening news. One of the ways to deal with the perceived loss of saving is to couch it in terms of getting other raises. You might get a raise at work and rather than spend it all you could save half in your 401(k) and spend half. As you pay off debt, rather than thinking of that as free cash flow, why not take half of that savings and put that towards getting life or disability insurance to hedge against those risks.</p><p> Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize for behavioral finance offers his personal way to deal with the perils of his nerves surrounding investing. In his book he quantifies the costs of trading too much in reacting or overconfidence. We typically buy low and sell high which is costly. His answer is to not look at his quarterly statement.</p><p> If you have ever seen one of those long-term results for the stock market since the Great Depression its long-term average came from not doing anything other than staying invested for the entire time in the S &amp; P top 500 US companies. Averages have their ups and downs. Have your stock investments done better?</p><p> We look forward to learning more about your situation and seeing how incorporating behavioral finance into the building of your financial plan might help you achieve your goals.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimconnolly\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jim Connolly  </a> </u> There is a powerful success factor behind every great business, which you can implement starting today.It can be summed up in just 4 words: It&rsquo;s all about them! <strong>  It&rsquo;s all about them </strong> The most successful business owners have figured it out. They know that their success is always going to be an extension of what they do for their clients. So, they consistently look for ways to be of greater value.In short: They are more interested in the success of their clients, than they are in their own fees or prices. <strong>  Why the me, me, me approach doesn&rsquo;t work </strong> The least effective business owners are focused on what they can get from their clients or customers.</p><li> They talk about closing the sale, rather than opening the relationship.</li><li> They talk about up-selling, rather than upping the value they provide to their clients.</li><li> They focus on what they can get, rather than what they can give.</li>That approach comes across in everything they do. As a result, their client retention is poor and they get few referrals from their clients, because we don&rsquo;t recommend greedy, self-obsessed people to our friends.<strong> Some ideas for developing the &lsquo;them&rsquo; approach to business</strong>It starts with an understanding that it&rsquo;s all about what you do, not what you say. Every business owner claims to be client focused. So, you need to demonstrate that you are passionate about the success of their business.For example:<li> Keep in regular contact and if  <u>  <a href=\"https://jimsmarketingblog.com/2012/11/02/how-to-quickly-increase-sales-and-build-stronger-relationships/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you find they have a problem, offer to help  </a> </u> .</li><li> Help them make connections. Think of people you know, who you can introduce them to&hellip; then do it!</li><li> Take a little time out every day, to help one of your clients in a way they were not expecting. This can be something as simple as sharing a useful blog post or newsletter article.</li><li> Find something valuable, which has a low delivery cost to you. Then add it to the service they receive from you&hellip; at no extra cost.</li><li> Keep your promises. Surprisingly few service providers can be totally relied upon. Become one of this rare group and your clients will notice (and tell their friends).</li>As the late Zig Ziglar used to say: You can have everything you want, if you will just help enough other people get what they want.",

    "title": "Why Do I Want a Financial Advisor?",
    "link": "why-do-i-want-a-financial-advisor",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p>That&rsquo;s a good question. On my television series, MoneyTrack (PBS), and as a guest on other shows, I explained the reasons to not hire an advisor. Mostly because I did so many scam alert stories about bad broker behavior. Since then, I&rsquo;ve decided to lay out some good reasons to work with a qualified financial advisor. Most of the big milestones in life require serious decision-making about finances. A qualified financial advisor can be an ally as you face changes and reach milestones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Focus on Asset Protection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve worked hard to build up your nest egg. It may represent your retirement fund, savings for college, or money for investment opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Provide Expert Advice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people think of financial advisors as stockbrokers on Wall Street who invest other people&rsquo;s (wealthy people&rsquo;s) money. It&rsquo;s true that financial advisors manage and invest a lot of wealth, but they also offer a host of other services, from kitchen-table household budgeting to socially responsible investing to complicated estate planning. Things have changed in the money management world, and new technologies are paving the way for everyday investors to access good, solid advice. You might be surprised to learn there are now hundreds of top-echelon investment advisors who want to help investors who are considered &ldquo;mass-affluent, &ldquo; meaning consumers who typically have $250,00 in total net worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>See the Big Picture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your advisor can look at your entire financial life with fresh eyes. Even if you have a strong idea of what you want your money to do for you, a good advisor can offer smart strategies to further those goals. Your advisors will typically sit down with you and talk through all aspects of your financial situation, including listening to your biggest worries to determine how you&rsquo;d like your money to work for you. Taking the big picture into consideration will greatly increase the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll be able to realize your lifestyle goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Connect the Dots</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about it...most aspects of your financial life relate to each other: For example, easing your tax burden may be offset by making charitable donations or setting up a simple family trust. Your financial advisor can help you keep everything in balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Handle Life Changes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your financial life is dynamic and changes all the time. Death, divorce, job loss, starting or selling a business, or even the beginning of a second career can warrant getting outside assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Future</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re close to retirement or have just retired. Your biggest worry may be how to make your savings last for 20, 30, even 40 years? Unpredictable events in the markets and in the economy can make growing wealth a challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while you may be concerned with your parents&rsquo; estate plan, advisors can also help with yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidance for Women</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So many women today juggle a hectic work schedule, saving for children&rsquo;s educations, retirement, and even caring for elderly parents. Keeping all of your balls in the air can make financial planning seem like a fantasy.There&rsquo;s also the fact that women live longer than men, making a solid investment strategy critically important in later years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shoring Up Your Estate Plan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A financial advisor who understands that equal doesn&rsquo;t always mean fair when it comes to dividing up money for heirs can really help lessen potential stresses and conflicts about who gets what after Mom and Dad are gone. It&rsquo;s all too common for parents to assume the heirs will work it all out later. The fact is, money arguments can divide even the most stable families</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A really qualified financial advisor can offer more than simply investing your savings in the stock market or lowering your tax bill. The key is finding the right partner who will focus growing and protecting your invested savings in sync with your personal style, specific goals, and unique needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iris.xyz/viewpoints/does-your-financial-advisor-help-to-improve-your-overall-life/\">Does Your Financial Advisor Help to Improve Your Overall Life?</a></p>",

    "title": "Company Culture Matters – Four Ways to Make Yours Thrive",
    "link": "company-culture-matters-four-ways-to-make-yours-thrive",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I am a big believer in company culture. Or rather, I should say positive company culture. <strong>  All companies have a culture, just as all companies have a brand. </strong> And, like a great brand, <strong>  a great company culture can make a big difference in a company&rsquo;s performance and valuation. </strong></p><p> Because of my conviction that a brand is more about what you do than what you say, I would argue that a company&rsquo;s culture and brand are inseparable. The culture gives form to the brand. The brand gives voice to the culture.</p><p> Recent research (see below) concludes that culture does, in fact, have a material impact on a company&rsquo;s business outcomes, and that the CEO&rsquo;s style and personality exert a disproportionate influence on culture. This probably comes as no surprise to any of you, but it reinforces the importance of making culture an acknowledged corporate asset, and one that existing leadership should be charged with preserving,</p><p> I was fortunate to work for D. A. Davidson for twenty years. When I joined the firm, it was led by Ian Davidson, the son of the founder and a visionary who transformed the company from a sleepy little stock and bond shop on Central Avenue in Great Falls, Montana to the largest regional full-service financial services firm in the West.</p><p> With his easy, approachable manner, gregariousness and inclusiveness, Mr. Davidson set the tone for his company&rsquo;s culture. It was a place where opinions were sought and respected, opportunities for growth and advancement were abundant (particularly as the firm grew), and everyone felt like they were a part of the family even while we were held to high standards of performance. When I left the firm in early 2013, Ian still sent hand-written birthday cards to each of the firm&rsquo;s nearly 1,100 employees &ndash; a practice he maintained for decades.</p><p> During the course of my tenure, Mr. Davidson was succeeded by two other CEOs, Vinney Purpura and Bill Johnstone. Each of these talented leaders put his unique stamp on the firm, presiding over growth, diversification and expansion, while preserving the firm&rsquo;s cultural qualities. To this day, the firm&rsquo;s culture is considered a critical business attribute, contributing to employee retention, recruiting and operating results. A topic I&rsquo;ll be addressing in greater detail in another article to be published soon.</p><p> While it&rsquo;s probably obvious that culture is affected by the CEO, it&rsquo;s also important to note that, for companies interested in protecting their cultures, culture can also be institutionalized &ndash; or structured &ndash; in ways that help sustain it, even when a new CEO&rsquo;s personality may not align well with the culture. </p><p> Some cultures actually dampen business outcomes. I know because I&rsquo;ve worked with companies like these too. But, assuming your company&rsquo;s culture aligns with your business objectives for growth and high performance, here are four actions you and your firm can take to help ensure that your company&rsquo;s culture survives and thrives&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  1. Enable Employee Ownership </strong></p><p> D.A. Davidson is employee owned. As stakeholders, employees are encouraged to view the company and their contributions from a larger, results-oriented perspective. Employees participate in the company&rsquo;s growth and success via the firm&rsquo;s various stock ownership programs.</p><p> If your company is private or public, there are a variety of techniques for making your employees stakeholders by making them owners and business partners.</p><p> <strong>  2. Communicate. Communicate. Communicate. </strong></p><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re determined to make your culture last, your employee stakeholders will need more than just a piece of the action. They need to know what you&rsquo;re doing and why. </strong></p><p> The old command and control form of leadership and my-way-or-the-highway proclamations won&rsquo;t cut it. If you honestly want your people to embrace all the implications of ownership, they have to be included in the discussion. This isn&rsquo;t some squishy principle designed to make everybody feel good. It&rsquo;s about accountability. It&rsquo;s about taking ownership in the success of our company.</p><p> Talk openly with your employees about what&rsquo;s going on &ndash; where you&rsquo;re killing it and where, frankly, you&rsquo;re losing ground to your competitors and why. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how your people will step up to bring fresh ideas and overcome challenges. </p><p> <strong>  3. Institutionalize Your Values </strong></p><p> Several years ago, I participated with a group of fellow D.A. Davidson employees from different businesses, regions and disciplines in an exercise to better understand the firm&rsquo;s culture and the qualities and behaviors that made it up.</p><p> As a result, we were able for the first time to identify actions and attitudes that did &ndash; and did not &ndash; align with the culture. With this information in hand, we instituted an annual award, recognizing the employees whose contributions represented the very best of the firm&rsquo;s culture. Celebrating cultural excellence is now a tradition at the firm.</p><p> <strong>  4. Make Culture an Important Part of Your Growth and Recruitment Strategy </strong></p><p> In a recent article, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.strategy-business.com/blog/A-Culture-of-Personality?gko=bab94\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A Culture of Personality  </a> </u> &rdquo; by Strategy + Business contributor Matt Palmquist, the author cites research on the topic of leadership and culture conducted by Charles O&rsquo;Reilly III, Stanford University; David Caldwell, Santa Clara University; Jennifer Chatman and Bernadette Doerr, both of the University of California Berkeley.</p><p> In their report, &ldquo; <u>  The Promise and Problems of Organizational Culture: CEO Personality, Culture and Firm Performance </u> &rdquo;, the researchers set out to test the long argued but empirically unproven theory that &ldquo;CEO personality affects a firm&rsquo;s culture and that culture is subsequently related to a broad set of organizational outcomes including a firm&rsquo;s financial performance (revenue growth, net income, Tobin&rsquo;s Q), reputation, and employee attitudes.&rdquo;</p><p> The research is compelling and delves deeply into the personality traits of CEOs and the implications for company cultures when those companies are seeking growth, adaptability, meticulous attention to detail, etc.</p><p> My point is this: For companies that have made their culture a business asset and strategic imperative, even a CEO whose personality and style might impair the culture would have difficulty completely undoing long observed corporate traditions. Even more important, in an environment where culture is highly valued by leadership, directors and the rank and file, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that such a CEO would ever land the job.</p><p> For me, this research validates one of my personal convictions &ndash; a company&rsquo;s culture matters. A lot. Companies that have strong cultures driving desirable business outcomes need to be deliberate about preserving and improving their cultures. The firm&rsquo;s leadership should dedicate themselves to understanding what make their cultures tick and instituting business practices that support the culture&rsquo;s long-term health and vitality.</p><p> In the consumer driven economy of the 21st century, your brand and your business are depending on it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Late this afternoon, the websites and Twitter feeds of both mainstream business and niche financial industry publications were blowing up with the news around yet another digital advice/financial planning and information company getting bought up by a more conventional financial services company.  <u>  <a href=\"/category/learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LearnVest, the \"innovative financial planning platform\" launched by uber-Millenial Alexa von Tobel, has agreed to become part of Northwestern Mutual Life's family.  </a> </u></p><p> Score this a win for the \"if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em\" camp. Just like Fidelity's takeout of eMoney (adviser tech/software) and Janus' purchase of Velocity Shares (ETFs), the acquisition of LearnVest by Northwestern Mutual is evidence that older, established financial industry firms are buying their way into the more innovative ends of the business. Why? Because they have to and they recognize it's better to play catch up than not play at all.</p><p> For the independently owned and operated RIA firms witnessing this quick succession of deals, take heed: you can ill-afford to delay your own adaptation to what's next; the time is now to ready your firm for the opportunities and challenges of today, as well as the yet to appear challenges of tomorrow.</p><p> In the case of LearnVest, Northwestern Mutual surmised that the upstart firm is doing a far better job at engaging millenials then the old insurance-oriented financial services behemoth has been. LearnVest has exemplified the best practices of how an RIA should market itself today: sharp multimedia content marketing combined with an assertive voice in the realm of media relations, all the while maintaining engagement with millenials in the places and channels were they are most comfortable.</p><p> If you look how LearnVest, Betterment, Mint, Personal Capital and others engage their audiences, they demonstrate a better grasp of the millenial mindset than the big Wall Street firms stocked with MBAs. But those firms are not without insight. Just look at  <u>  <a href=\"http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2014/02/07/millennials-may-be-the-smartest-generation-when-it-comes-to-finances/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the study released by UBS in 2014  </a> </u> , that showcased these stats:</p><li> 45 percent of Millennials believe saving is the key to financial success, compared to 39 percent of older generations.</li><li> Only 28 percent of Millennials see investment as important in long-term financial success, compared to 52 percent of Baby Boomers. <br/>  </li><p> The study shows that the mindset is about saving, not investing. But, when was the last time you saw an advertisement from UBS that spoke to this understanding? I am not picking on UBS, but rather using this to underscore why the independent, nimble RIA firms are still in position to catch up to - and in many cases get ahead of - the curve. The facts are that many recognize the need and the challenge to engage a new generation, but many firms haven't fully embraced the call to action.</p><p> I had the fortune today to speak with a group of female leaders of approximately 15 Washington, DC area RIA firms at a session hosted by Schwab Advisor Services. When given the opportunity to share their own points of view, each woman said that they knew they needed to do more to capture the opportunities and meet the challenges that the generational, technological and customer preference shifts were bringing to their business.</p><p> The road map set forth by Alexa von Tobel and LearnVest can be replicated, at least in terms of marketing. If you want to get a sense of how RIA firms are doing it, send me a message about what you are looking for. Or, if you have your own take on the shifting sands of the financial advice business, leave a comment here.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  I propose you stop using an elevator pitch to describe your advisory business. </strong></p><p> You have likely been told every advisor needs to have an elevator speech. You need a way to summarize your value proposition. A fast and concise way to describe your worth to a prospective client. A clear statement that differentiates you from other advisors.</p><p> And you need all that. But I recommend you stop using an elevator pitch.</p><p> I suggest this because you may think an elevator pitch is something that a salesperson uses. Because you are uncomfortable selling your services. Because it feels fake. Because it is too &ldquo;salesy.&rdquo; Because it is uncomfortable. And that, because of all these reasons, you resist doing it. I have clients who have spent months working with me to refine a unique and succinct elevator pitch who, months later, still do not use it habitually because they are uncomfortable saying it. So you should not have one.</p><p> That still leaves you with a need to concisely describe to people what is special about the kind of advice you provide. That explains quickly and clearly what sets you apart from other advisors and why your target client should hire you over the other advisors they might meet. To address that need I recommend that you develop a positioning statement for your firm.</p><p> &ldquo;Positioning&rdquo; refers to a marketing concept first popularized by legendary marketing strategists Al Ries and Jack Trout in their book of the same name in 1981. In the book they discuss the problems faced by anyone trying to communicate something in an over communicated society. (Imagine &ndash; it was an over communicated society and we had not yet invented the World Wide Web! Think of the scale of that problem today.) They point out that the attempt to communicate what you do may be futile and that what you really want is to occupy a certain position in people&rsquo;s minds. The goal is to become associated with a concept that is not occupied by other companies. The way that IBM occupies the position of big computers, Kleenex occupies the position of facial tissue, and Lego occupies the position of plastic interlocking building blocks. What I refer to as &ldquo;owning a spot on the client&rsquo;s brain.&rdquo;</p><p> Everyone has a filing system in their mind. And for every concept, every product, every person, every brand, we attempt to find a pigeonhole to put it in. Your goal as a marketer is to occupy the right cubby. You cannot occupy a space that another company or person occupies and you cannot occupy something that has no pigeonhole, like service or peace of mind. So your objective when you meet someone new who asks about your firm is to help them file you in the right place.</p><p> You have probably had an experience like I did early in my career. I was visiting a client&rsquo;s office. I managed the investments in the company&rsquo;s 401(k), and the personal portfolios of several of the firm&rsquo;s executives and managers. I noticed that the client had a life insurance illustration on the desk in front of him. He was looking to add key person policies for several of the top people. I asked if I could bring him a proposal if only for comparison purposes to make sure they were getting the best value. His response? &ldquo;Oh, you do insurance?&rdquo;</p><p> I had inadvertently positioned myself as an investment manager even though my original training was as a financial planner and I always took a comprehensive approach with my clients. This client had worked with me for several years. When I put together his original personal financial plan, I reviewed his risk management program and determined neither he nor his wife needed any additional coverage. Over time, our original conversation about insurance faded in his memory and what replaced it was the ongoing work I did for him. And since I never taught him any better way of describing me, he talked about investment management when he mentioned me to other people. And why he almost went to another advisor when he found that he needed insurance in his business.</p><p> <strong>  This is why it is so important to make it clear what makes you different from other advisors the first time you have an opportunity to describe your firm to someone. </strong> And to repeat versions of it throughout your relationship. You want to make sure they file you in the right pigeonhole so that you are easy to recall when one of their friends describes a need for what occupies that same pigeonhole.</p><p> And so you need a way to describe what you do to position you in the right spot in the clients mind. Ideally it will start by identifying the unique need of your ideal client and the special way you address that need. It may lead to listing a couple examples of what kind of outcome or experience certain clients had because they worked with you.</p><p> <strong>  Here is a structure I recommend as a way to start building your positioning statement: </strong></p><li> <strong>  A quick introduction that summarizes what is different and most significant about what you offer. </strong> It should run no more than about 10 seconds. And it should serve primarily to prompt a question if the person you&rsquo;re talking to is in your target market or knows someone who is.</li><li> <strong>  If they open the door to a longer conversation, give a sentence or two that summarizes the benefit you provide. </strong></li><li> <strong>  List a couple of bullet points with facts that are relevant to your target client. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Possibly include a surprising statistic that many advisors would not know if they did not have the same area of focus. </strong> You may want to introduce it with &ldquo;for example, did you know&hellip;?&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Pivot to a client story that illustrates the benefit of the work you do. </strong> Stories are more memorable than a list of benefits and a great way to explain the outcome of working with you rather than what the process will look like.</li><p> <strong>  A positioning statement is not a sales pitch. </strong> It is simply a more focused and meaningful way of explaining the business you are in. It is a way of telling people how to file you in their mental records. Even better, it is a lot more interesting than a sales pitch and does not come with the kind of pressure a sales pitch might generate.</p><p> I have created a short guide with 10 tips on putting together a great positioning statement for your company. You can download it for free  <a href=\"http://free-report.theclientdrivenpractice.com/10-steps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> . I hope you find it helpful.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s your positioning statement? What are some of the best ones you have heard? </strong> If you use or have come across an outstanding one, or want to get an opinion on yours, post it to the comments below.

    "link": "how-high-net-worth-individuals-make-financial-decisions",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Emily Heaton </u></p><p> Many High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) work long hours and often have very limited time to consider the long term management of their accumulating wealth.</p><p> While everyone can make investment mistakes, bad decisions can be more significant for wealthy individuals.</p><p> Understanding  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/blog/how-to-reach-high-net-worth-individuals-online\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   how to attract high net worth clients  </a> </u>  before the damage is done is important to financial services firms.</p><p> Digital marketing can help. Let's take a look.</p><h3> The Desire for Self Control</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to our finances the degree to which we can control our emotional reactions when making investment decisions will dictate how successful we are. <br/> <br/> Whilst we are all individual, research shows that, when it comes to our desire for self control, distinct groups emerge amongst HNWIs. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Those more likely to have a greater desire for self control over financial behaviour: </strong></p><li> Women</li><li> Entrepreneurs</li><li> People who inherited their wealth</li><li> People whose wealth comes from property or bonuses <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Those less likely to have a greater desire for self control over financial behaviour: </strong></p><li> Men</li><li> Older people</li><li> People who earned their wealth</li><li> People whose wealth comes from investments <br/>  </li><p> Financial services firms know that patience, continual market study and occasional rebalancing are the keys to creating and managing a successful long term investment portfolio.</p><p> Persuading their next clients that working with professionals is critcal to yielding the best results can be a challenge if that client is less likely to have a greater desire for self control over financial behaviour.</p><h3> 8 Concepts of Behavioural Finance</h3><p> <br/> Rooted in psychology and economics, behavioural finance is the study of why people make irrational financial decisions.</p><p> Understanding these concepts can help firms to appreciate the seeming contradictions demonstrated by HNWIs.</p><p> <strong>  1. Anchoring </strong></p><p> The concept of anchoring is the tendency for us to attach or anchor our thoughts around a reference point, despite the fact that it may not have any logical relevance to the decision at hand.</p><p> <strong>  2. Mental accounting </strong></p><p> Mental accounting refers to the tendency for us to divide our money into separate accounts based on criteria like the source and intent for the money.</p><p> In addition, the importance of the money in each account also varies depending upon the source and what it is intended to be used for.</p><p> <strong>  3. Confirmation and Hindsight bias </strong></p><p> Confirmation bias refers to how we tend to be more receptive to new information that confirms our preconceived ideas about a subject.</p><p> The hindsight bias represents how we believe that after the fact, the occurrence of an event was completely obvious.</p><p> <strong>  4. Gambler&rsquo;s Fallacy </strong></p><p> The gambler's fallacy refers to an incorrect interpretation of statistics where someone believes that the occurrence of a random independent event would somehow mean that another random independent event is less likely to happen.</p><p> <strong>  5. Herd behaviour </strong></p><p> Herd behaviour represents the preference for individuals to mimic the behaviours or actions of a larger sized group. Also called social proofing.</p><p> <strong>  6. Overconfidence </strong></p><p> Overconfidence represents the tendency for an investor to overestimate his or her ability in performing some action/task.</p><p> <strong>  7. Overreaction </strong></p><p> Overreaction occurs when one reacts to a piece of news in a way that is greater than actual impact of the news.</p><p> <strong>  8. Prospect theory </strong></p><p> Prospect theory says that people do not feel equal levels of joy and pain to the same effect.</p><p> The average person tends to be more loss sensitive, ie he or she will feel more pain in receiving a loss compared to the amount of joy felt from receiving an equal amount of gain.</p><h3> The Value of Professional Support</h3><p> <br/> Successful individuals believe that they will be successful at just about anything they tackle.  <br/> <br/> Yet nearly half of all HNWIs would like to have more self control when it comes to making financial decisions.  <br/> <br/> It is important for financial services firms to understand behavioural finance concepts and how they apply to HNWIs if they are to attract them as future clients. <br/> <br/> Given that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/blog/80-of-your-next-clients-are-online-are-you\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   over 80% of HNWIs are online  </a> </u> , digital marketing messages conveyed via blogging, offers and nurturing email programmes will be effective.</p>",

The researchers identified procrastinators in the sample as the people who waited until the final day of open enrollment to choose their health plan from among their employer options.  (To separate them from employees who intentionally delayed so they could collect enough information, the researchers looked at how often people used various online employee benefit tools &ndash; these strategic delayers were very active; procrastinators were not.)</p><p> The procrastinators, when confronted with a range of retirement saving decisions, consistently made different decisions:</p><li> Just 7.5 percent of new employees enrolled in at least one of two voluntary retirement plans offered by the University of Illinois &ndash; this number looks low but these are supplemental plans for U of I employees, who also have a defined benefit plan   Procrastinators were significantly less likely to enroll &ndash; by 2.4 percentage points &ndash; in the supplemental plans, even when the researchers controlled for age.</li><li> Of the procrastinators who eventually signed up and contributed to 55 company plans also analyzed in this study, they delayed for between 44 days and 85 days longer than non-procrastinators.</li><li> Procrastinators also saved 1.3 percent to 2 percent less than the average contribution of 7.2 percent of pay.</li><li> In the subset of employers that automatically enrolled their workers, procrastinators were more likely to contribute the default percentage selected by the employer than to choose their own contribution rate.</li><li> Procrastination also influenced investment decisions.  Procrastinators proved more likely to remain in their employer&rsquo;s default investment options, such as target date funds, than to make independent choices. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Procrastinators don&rsquo;t store away as much for the future, because they suffer from a severe case of what economists call &ldquo;present-bias preferences.&rdquo;  </strong> This study, however, offered one bright spot: they are very amenable to letting their employers, through defaults, make these decisions for them.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Complexity has many definitions; excessive complication is the simplest. In today&rsquo;s business, chronic complexity is stifling, stagnating, and bringing companies to their knees. </strong> This is why we hear so much about focus from C-suites and corporate boards. CEOs talk focus all the time and nod to its importance, but few take the necessary measures to cut through complexity and clear a path to clarity and coherence.</p><p> The truth of the matter is that business leaders are the ones adding complexity to their organizations. To thwart the impact of low-cost foreign competition and to meet the accelerating demands of customers and shareholders, they embark on doing more, and adding more. This can mean expanding product lines, entering new markets and geographies, line extending brands, acquiring new businesses, creating projects, and adding layers of management to manage the self-created complexity.</p><p> <strong>  It takes discipline to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to new revenue, even when the sources are strategically questionable. </strong> After all, the fixed overheads are already in place. Surely, the newfound margin will drop to the bottom line &ndash; it will not. Added complexity makes sure of that. It also takes courage to make tough strategic sacrifices, such as killing pet projects and sacred cows, and reducing the customer list. Giving up something of value for the sake of other considerations is the essence of sacrifice. Companies that appreciate the power of sacrifice also appreciate that &lsquo;do less better&rsquo; is a winning strategy at both the corporate and functional level.</p><p> <strong>  Doing less, better applies to both large and small companies. These 5 practice focus very well. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Coca-Cola </strong></p><p> Coca-Cola&rsquo;s focus begins at 30,000 feet, where corporate strategy is crafted. Back in 1989, Coke divested Columbia pictures, the last of their non-beverage businesses. From that point on, they committed themselves to soft drinks. History tells us that Coca-Cola has put corporate clarity, coherence and specialization to good work. Their economic performance supports the theory that specialists beat generalists. Although Coca-Cola sales lag those of their food and beverage arch rival, Coke&rsquo;s profit and market cap significantly outpaces Pepsi. That said, $47 billion in sales isn&rsquo;t too shabby for a company that sells only soft drinks. Thanks to Coke&rsquo;s global reach, brand power, bottling network, and single-minded focus, I&rsquo;m betting on Coca-Cola sustaining this competitive advantage.</p><p> <strong>  2.  LEGO </strong></p><p> Back in the &lsquo;90s, LEGO had cluttered its corporate structure with the complexity that comes with acquiring a variety of businesses from apparel to theme parks. By 2004, sales and profits were in double digit declines. Complexity had brought LEGO to its knees. Something had to be done. A new management team pruned several of the acquisitions, stopped &lsquo;doing more and more,&rsquo; and started &lsquo;doing less better&rsquo; by giving their full attention to their core business, LEGO blocks. They launched new product kits, created the blockbuster LEGO Digital Designer, and negotiated some very lucrative licensing arrangements such as Harry Potter and Star Wars. The outcome of &lsquo;doing less better&rsquo; in market scope has been stellar; past five years sales have doubled and earnings have tripled. With 60% of annual sales coming from innovative new products, it is clear that LEGO has not been idle. &lsquo;Doing less better&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean doing less work.</p><p> <strong>  3.  In-N-Out Burger </strong></p><p> MacDonald&rsquo;s is the largest fast food restaurant in the world. Last year, MacDonald&rsquo;s boasted sales of $28 billion. That&rsquo;s a lot of hamburgers. But with a menu of well over a 100 items, MacDonald&rsquo;s sells plenty more than hamburgers. By contrast, California&rsquo;s In-N-Out Burger, keeps its menu simple &ndash; 3 types of beef burgers, fries, shakes and soft drinks. That&rsquo;s it. If you want chicken, salad, pizza, or wraps, get out of the line-up to the counter and go elsewhere. In-N-Out understands strategic sacrifice. Simplicity is the culture; it is the cornerstone of customer service &ndash; even extends to geographies. They&rsquo;ve been in business since 1948 and 80% of their 290 outlets are in California. They&rsquo;ve never franchised . . . never wanted to expand to 50 states . . . and going public? Blasphemy. Now for the kicker. Despite the limited product line that doesn&rsquo;t even include a chicken burger, In-N-Out&rsquo;s sales per outlet rivals those of Macdonald&rsquo;s.</p><p> <strong>  4. Intuit </strong></p><p> Intuit develops financial and tax preparation software for small business, accountants and the general public. Their goal is to make accounting, simple. This vision establishes the principles for running a simple operation. But Intuit isn&rsquo;t a small business. A workforce of 8,000 led by a transformational CEO, seemingly knows how to deal with the ever-changing digital world. Their evolving brands, Quicken, TurboTax, and QuickBooks continue to be strong contributors to 2014&rsquo;s revenue of $4.5 billion and record earnings. Intuit is successful because they bring their &lsquo;do less better&rsquo; cultural ethic to their customers. At tax time, there&rsquo;s a broad array of options and choices available to get through the arduous task of tax preparation. Intuit cuts through that complexity with software that simplifies. Because of that, they are rewarded with brand loyalty.</p><p> <strong>  5. Nike </strong></p><p> Nike is known for linking the spirit of American pop culture to sports by capitalizing on the public&rsquo;s idolization of athletic heroes. Ever since the launch of the &lsquo;Just Do It&rsquo; campaign, Nike shoes have bolstered their functional product benefits with emotional pay-offs. That&rsquo;s the secret to their brand power. Management power rests with focused strategies on two product categories, athletic shoes and apparel. Although this strategy led them into acquisitions of other brand names, when complexity rears its ugly head, Nike rectifies. Such was the case with the divestment of Umbro and Cole Hann, set loose to facilitate greater focus on the Nike brand of footwear and apparel. As for logistics and strategic simplicity, anything branded &lsquo;Nike&rsquo; must complement Nike footwear and fit within the same marketing and distribution channels.</p><p> <strong>  Coca-Cola, LEGO, In-N-Out, Intuit, and Nike are fortified with leaders who believe in, and practice focus and specialization 365 days a year. These companies are a testament to the power of strategic sacrifice in a complex world. </strong></p><p> For more on focus and sacrifice check out my new book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dolessbetter.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Do Less Better  </a> </u> .

    "content": "Over the past few years I have made a significant investment in time (and some money) into evaluating the biggest levers for growth. Basically, I have tried to figure out how to get a predictable output that is more than what you put into it (i.e. scale). Whether you are looking at a startup or a 400M+ company looking to scale for bigger growth, these three items prove to be the deciding factors most influential to a company&rsquo;s ability to grow at scale&hellip;regardless of product.<li> Positioning &ndash; your story behind the product.</li><li> Process &ndash; how you get things done.</li><li> People &ndash; those on your team and around your team. <br/>  </li><p> Why isn&rsquo;t product in there? Am I saying product can&rsquo;t drive growth? Quite the contrary, I definitely think it can, but I try to view it as an output of the following items instead of an input.</p><h3> <img alt=\"\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/POSITIONING-300x225.png\" width=\"300\"/></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  POSITIONING </strong></p><p> This is one of the most impactful areas of any business, yet almost always overlooked or under-invested. Let&rsquo;s start with a definition of positioning: Your positioning is your story.</p><li> The WHO you help&hellip;</li><li> The WHAT you do&hellip;</li><li> The WHY you do it&hellip;</li><li> The HOW you do it differently&hellip; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  This is not just a Marketing ploy to get you to write down some &ldquo;fluff&rdquo; on a brochure. </strong> Think about each of these activities that drive scale&hellip; your story is a part of each and every one of them.</p><li> <strong>  Raise funding &ndash; </strong> If investors don&rsquo;t get it&hellip; you don&rsquo;t get their money.</li><li> <strong>  Develop product </strong> &ndash; If the team working on your product doesn&rsquo;t know the big picture on what they are developing, how can you expect it to be developed right? I include the decision to pivot under this umbrella. If you decide to change what you are doing (i.e. your story), you will need to change your product.</li><li> <strong>  Sell product </strong> &ndash; Every conversation is a potential sale. If your employees or  customers can&rsquo;t describe what you do, why you do it, and how you are different &ndash; then do not expect many sales to happen.</li><li> <strong>  Form partnerships </strong> &ndash; Partners must have a quick understanding of where you fit into their ecosystem, so if that is not easy for them to figure out, then you are probably not going to achieve much from your partner network.</li><li> <strong>  Expand networks </strong> &ndash; When you can get people outside of your network to understand what you do, it is much easier for them to share with their network, and so on&hellip; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  This is an amazing video from Google Ventures that speaks to the essence of getting your story right. </strong>  Beware &ndash; it is an actual 1hr lecture for a class, but absolutely chock full of information that will make you think twice about how you are going to market. Grab a comfy seat and take a look.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/za7PbKZcnos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-29-at-9.22.00-AM.png\" width=\"839\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  So what do you about your positioning?  </strong> Here is an article written that gives a great summary on positioning by someone who really, really knows her stuff:</p><p> <a href=\"http://firstround.com/review/Positioning-Your-Startup-is-Vital-Heres-How-to-Do-It-Right/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-29-at-9.30.28-AM.png\" width=\"739\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  PROCESS </strong></p><p> This is the biggest pain point that I have seen for any marketing organization is the process behind GSD (getting stuff done). What is interesting is the dynamic of the first two items (people and positioning) that often cause issues with the process of getting things done.</p><p> Regardless of your product, the ability to create marketing items to increase brand awareness and drive demand is absolutely fundamental to scale. If you are not working to become more agile in your approach to marketing, then you are already at a disadvantage.</p><p> So if you are not getting what you expect from Marketing, there is a great read here from Scott Brinker&rsquo;s ChiefMarTec blog about Agile Marketing:</p><p> <a href=\"http://chiefmartec.com/2014/09/agile-era-business-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-29-at-9.25.51-AM.png\" width=\"595\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  PEOPLE </strong></p><p> This should not be earth shattering&hellip; having the right people in the right place is well known. What I am challenging is the focus on what you specifically want them to do in order to drive scale throughout the team. Depending on what you need at a certain stage of growth, you need to consider what is the most important type of person to bring into the mix. Sometimes being too conservative on your PEOPLE approach can significantly hinder your growth.</p><p> Who do you have on your team that is not only good at what they do, but adds successful and sustainable value to the business? The people on your team impact your ability to:</p><li> Raise funding &ndash; Having the right people allows you to attract and raise more money. More money = more options&hellip; it is that simple.</li><li> Develop product &ndash; The product is a result of the people developing it, so getting product people to ask the right questions is critical to growth.</li><li> Sell product &ndash; Just getting people to be passionate about your idea significantly helps to sell the product. Finding people that believe in the vision more than the actual widgets will pay for itself over and over.</li><li> Form partnerships &ndash; Getting others to sell for you or integrate with you extends your product beyond what only you (and your team) can produce.</li><li> Expand networks &ndash; I am a firm believer in the network effect and 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon&hellip; It&rsquo;s all about who you know&hellip; and who they know&hellip; and so on.</li><p> <strong>  PRODUCT </strong></p><p> So now that you see what positioning, process, and people can do as an input, it should make more sense to see product as the output of it. If you want to dig into how to do more with your product, then there is no better source than the Lean Startup.</p><p> <a href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/principles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-29-at-9.26.30-AM.png\" width=\"597\"/> </a></p><p>  </p>",

It means millennials have a lot of debt in the form of student loans.</p><p> Holmes says that 30% of millennials feel that student debt has hurt their financial independence. That&rsquo;s the trade off between earning a degree and potentially landing a job; some people end up in debt after graduation.</p><p> Unfortunately we live in a time when education is not affordable for everyone. However there are options for students who wish to pursue a higher education but can&rsquo;t afford the tuition.</p><p> Students can apply for grants to enter their program of study. Full and partial scholarships are also available for a variety of reasons from sports ability to outstanding GPAs. If you want to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree, see if your employer offers tuition reimbursement. Check with your local student services center or guidance counselor to get more information on financial aid for college students.</p><p> <strong>  Living for today, not thinking about tomorrow </strong></p><p> Living in the moment is both a gift and a curse. MoneyTips.com says &ldquo;One-third (of millennials) either aren&rsquo;t meeting their financial objectives or haven&rsquo;t set goals.&rdquo; This has come to be a common millennial attitude.</p><p> The younger generation is known for living in the moment with the &ldquo;you only live once&rdquo; mentality. That&rsquo;s great for today while you can still work, but what about tomorrow? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to work because you want to and not because you have to?</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t know where to start, get off the fence and start small! Any amount of money aside for retirement every month is a good idea because over time a little bit of money can add up to  <u>  <a href=\"http://yourrichestlifeplanning.com/investing-money-grows/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a lot of savings  </a> </u> . Taking advantage of  <u>  <a href=\"http://yourrichestlifeplanning.com/choosing-best-retirement-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employer savings plans or IRAs  </a> </u>  is another way millennials (actually everyone) can save more for their future.</p><p> Of course the more you save in earlier years, the sooner you can achieve financial independence, but not saving at all means you&rsquo;ll be working forever. I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t want to do that. I think we all look forward to the day we can at least have the option to do something else.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What makes a successful TED talk? </strong></p><p> Here at the <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People  </u> </a> we endeavored to find out. Why do some TED talks rack up millions of views, change lives and are talked about everywhere?</p><p> We were amazed at what we found. Before I get into the 5 patterns, I want to give you some juicy background:</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s New? </strong></p><p> A few authors have aspired to take on the puzzle of what makes a successful TED talk. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s different:</p><li> <strong>  More than One Opinion: </strong>  We crowd-sourced the data. Instead of one researcher coding and looking for patterns, we had hundreds of participants rating and analyzing the talks.</li><li> <strong>  Beyond Words:  </strong> Although there are some amazing books about the verbal patterns, strategies and rhetoric in TED talks, very few focus on the body language patterns. And we quickly found out that the nonverbal is even more important than the verbal (see #1 below).</li><li> <strong>  Previous Research: </strong> We based our experiment on peer-reviewed academic research on nonverbal patterns. In this way, we know our results have a solid foundation in respected scientific trials.</li><li> <strong>  Controls: </strong>  To get the most accurate results, we only used videos that had been posted on TED.com (so they had similar exposure), were posted in 2010 (so they had about the same amount of time to garner views) and were between 15 and 20 minutes long (so extra short or long talks didn&rsquo;t skew the participants&rsquo; ratings). We also worked with the amazing Data Scientist, Brandon Vaughn, to make sure our results were solid. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Why TED? </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   TED  </u> </a>  is a non-profit that posts videos of the best speakers in the world presenting on a variety of fascinating topics. This gave us the perfect database of videos of charismatic and intelligent people. Most importantly, the number of views on each video gave us a clear idea of popularity. For example, here are two amazing talks on leadership: one by Fields Wicker-Miurin called &ldquo;Learning from Leadership&rsquo;s Missing Manual&rdquo; and one by Simon Sinek called &ldquo;How Great Leaders Inspire Action&rdquo;. Note the difference in views:</p><p> <strong>  Puzzle: </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-02-05-at-2.09.16-PM.png\" width=\"651\"/></p><p> While Wicker-Muirin gets a respectable 609,366 views, Sinek&rsquo;s talk gets a mind-boggling 20,929,959 views! And:</p><li> <strong>  Both talks were published the same month (September 2009) which means they had the same amount of time to garner views. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They are both on similar topics. </strong></li><li> <strong>  These are both respected, but NOT famous speakers. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Something about Sinek&rsquo;s talk caught fire, captured people and went viral. We see this pattern over and over again on TED. Some talks hit big and some don&rsquo;t. But, why? Watch the video and see our findings. </p><p> While we examined TED talks in this experiment, the implications are wide reaching. We are talking about how to increase your charisma, presence and the personal power from a stage, in board rooms and when interacting with people.</p><p> For further reading on the study, citations and bios, please click <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/03/secrets-of-a-successful-ted-talk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As Craig Groeschel says in his book, <u>  Chazown </u> , to find our purpose we need to learn 3 things about ourselves. We need to know what makes us glad, sad, and mad.</p><p> <strong>  I am fortunate to have discovered my purpose early in life. Fortunate to have had the courage to pursue my dreams, follow my passion, and then have it lead me to my purpose. It was there I found my destiny and realized what kind of life legacy I wanted to leave behind. </strong></p><p> Even though I was born and raised in confines of a religious commune started by my grandfather, I realized in my early teens that I was passionate about about entrepreneurship (before I even knew what the word meant). I had this dream of becoming a successful businessman. Being born a communist, was not going stop me from becoming a capitalist!</p><p> I left that commune at the age of 21. I was passionate about life and was willing to do whatever ever it took to be success. I loved every minute of being an entrepreneur. I was on fire. Entrepreneurship and starting new enterprises really turned me on. It made me glad, if you will!</p><p> <strong>  However, the danger that exists when one is on fire, is a thing called &ldquo;Burnout&rdquo;. At the age of 27, after achieving most of the goals I had set for my life, I suffered a complete mental, physical and spiritual  <u>   burnout  </u>  . The thing that I was so passionate about almost cost me my life. </strong></p><p> As I recovered from burnout, I realized that I needed to find a greater meaning for my life. As a result, I ended up in Guatemala for a weekend tour of some mission projects there. It was that weekend that I discovered what it took to make me sad. Seeing those kids living in the dump and digging through the garbage is a picture I can&rsquo;t erase from my mind til today.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve seen extreme poverty and the pain it causes, you can&rsquo;t un-see it. Having exposed myself to suffering caused by poverty, I realized that poverty really does make me sad. Visiting other developing countries since, I was to discover what it would take to make me mad.</p><p> Social injustice and corruption hold millions in grip of poverty. Seeing that and experiencing that first-hand as I have now chosen to relocate to <u>  Romania </u> , makes me mad! The lack of respect for self, for human life and laws God and man are the trap called &ldquo;systemic poverty&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  Knowing what makes me glad, sad, and mad&hellip;has been key to helping find my purpose in life. That purpose is: helping people know, go, and grow. </strong> Teaching people by freely sharing information, then providing them the motivation they need to get them to go and start their own enterprise, and then finally inspiring them to grow and prosper.</p><p> I did not have the opportunity to attend school beyond the 8th grade. However, I knew that I wanted more for my life. Without formal education, business experience or contacts, I quickly became a success in business. The experience of making the transition from communism to capitalism has helped me help many other young people in similar circumstances.</p><p> My first attempt at making a difference with the knowledge and experience I had, was helping with the construction of churches, orphanages and community centers. First in Guatemala and then in Romania. In time, I realized that we can build all the buildings we want, but relief will never bring an end to poverty. We need to build business to employ people.</p><p> <strong>  I was still wrong! I&rsquo;ve recently concluded that first we must build the people by training young people for entrepreneurship. These entrepreneurs will then build businesses. </strong> The businesses will provide employment for the people. The people can then build and maintain their own buildings.</p><p> The old saying &ldquo;Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for life.&rdquo; is not the answer. If everyone who is able to, feeds themselves, we still have poverty! We are forgetting what it takes to bring about transformation in a community, in a country. It takes people who are caring, compassionate and able to give back to their communities.</p><p> Ending poverty will take more than skilled fishermen. It will take young entrepreneurs start fishing enterprises that produce more than what their family will consume. The question is: What kind of business can be started anywhere, with very capital, and yet have the potential to produce significant profits.</p><p> <strong>  I believe that the answer lies in the power of the internet. </strong> Think about it. The young person in a poor village in Romania, where the average wage is $2.00/hr (if you can find a job), only needs a computer and access to the internet to have same earning potential as the person living in any major city in North America.</p><p> The same internet makes it possible to train these young people online, without ever having to leave their village. Sounds real simple.  Why then does poverty still exist, you may be thinking.</p><p> The answer to that question is simple, but not easy. The missing ingredient to begin the process from poverty to prosperity is information or education. The Bible says &ldquo;For the lack of knowledge people perish.&rdquo; And if people don&rsquo;t KNOW, they won&rsquo;t GO. The problem is: most people don&rsquo;t know, that they don&rsquo;t know.</p><p> <strong>  Education is the first step in process of training young entrepreneurs. </strong> But where to find the teachers? The key is not more <u>  missionaries </u> , but rather experienced entrepreneurs sharing their knowledge and experience. This can be done online.</p><p> This realization and my experience on the ground in a developing country, has led me to my purpose in life and the vision of creating a future young entrepreneur online training system to empower young people in developing countries to become entrepreneurs. More to follow in a future article.</p><p> What about you? What is they makes you glad? What makes you sad? What makes you mad? Have you found your purpose?</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "in-business-timing-is-everything",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://alexpirouz.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Alex Pirouz  </u> </a></p><p> Good timing can turn a mediocre product into a breakout success; bad timing can destroy an otherwise successful career.</p><p> <strong>  In business, timing is everything. </strong></p><p> Unfortunately, most people think timing is just like luck. It isn&rsquo;t. Nothing can be further from the truth. It&rsquo;s a critical success factor and you can learn to use it to your advantage &hellip; or let it bite you in the you-know-what.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a business plan, a negotiation, a customer relationship, a product launch, a presentation, a marketing campaign, a proposal, a career, or an entire corporation. Timing can make or break it; I see it happen all the time.</p><p> Unfortunately, even some of the best and brightest business people consider timing as an afterthought. Their thinking goes something like this: 1) idea, 2) budget, 3) target customers or audience, 4) competition, &hellip; , 27) timing.</p><p> I have no idea why, but it&rsquo;s true. And sad. Really.</p><p> <strong>  FEW THINGS MATTER MORE IN BUSINESS THAN TIMING </strong></p><p> Being too early or too late can be just the same as failing &ndash; even if the idea itself is correct.</p><p> But, if you get your timing just right, you can make a lot of other mistakes and still succeed.</p><p> In terms of timing, it&rsquo;s hard to beat British technology entrepreneur Michael Birch. He and his wife started working on the social networking website Bebo in January 2005. It grew rapidly and just three years later, he sold it to AOL for $850 million.</p><p> Yet a mere two years after the purchase, AOL proceeded to dispose of Bebo for an undisclosed amount thought to be less than $10m. As Birch said afterwards: &ldquo;Obviously, the timing was good for us and bad for AOL.&rdquo;</p><p> Did Birch predict the financial crisis and the rise of Facebook? I doubt it. But, he saw a fashion, obtained sound advice and knew when to take some cash off the table.</p><p> <strong>  TIMING IS EVERYTHING </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;ve likely heard this said many times before but, a clear explanation of why is rarely forthcoming. And, since timing is so important, how can you identify and take advantage of good timing?</p><p> To answer this question I spoke with a Sydney based serial entrepreneur Aleksandar Svetski, founder of Crave Frozen Yogurt in Australia &amp; NZ. Svetski seems to have a knack for picking the right time to enter an industry or launch a new product/service.</p><p> For the past 6 years he&rsquo;s managed to successfully time his entry and exit within various businesses he has been involved in. All were in different industries.</p><p> &ldquo;I have a saying: Too early and you end up being the guy with the arrows in your back. Too Late, and you missed the show,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p> &ldquo;At 19 years old, I thought I was a hot-shot trader making what most people make in a year in under a month, doing what I liked to call &ldquo;swing trading&rdquo;. I learnt the hard way that you need to be on the right side of the trend otherwise you&rsquo;ll get run over. It&rsquo;s a lesson I will never forget,&rdquo; Svetski continued.</p><p> &ldquo;Markets are a collective and, whether it&rsquo;s the stock market or a more micro-form of a market your business is involved in, if you can spot the trend, then you can take advantage of it. A word of caution though. Some trends don&rsquo;t take off or, as we call them in the world of trading, &ldquo;a false break&rdquo;. This means it looks like something will take off, but in reality it&rsquo;s a short-term move. A smart business owner and a smart trader always waits for confirmation of a trend before they invest. That is, they wait until there is some support behind the movement,&rdquo; he continued.</p><p> &ldquo;This is exactly what we did when introducing CRAVE Frozen Yogurt into Australia. We waited, we bided our time, we sharpened our axe all whilst waiting for the actual trend to be confirmed and the market to adopt the product before we charged in, all guns blazing,&rdquo; Svetski shared.</p><h3> How Do You Create Perfect Timing?</h3><p> <br/> Even though it plays an important role in your business&rsquo;s development, identifying the right timing in business is fairly simple.</p><p> Here are four things that you can do to try to find perfect timing.</p><p> <strong>  NETWORK WITH OTHERS </strong></p><p> Doing this will allow you to take advantage of a wider variety of resources and insight that could prove useful. Essentially, you never know what other people know, until you ask.</p><p> <strong>  STUDY RELEVANT WEBSITES AND BLOGS </strong></p><p> Find online sources that are related to what you do and compare them to other similarly themed sites.</p><p> If a trend is emerging in your industry, you can bet that more than a few places will be talking about it. So, follow what others are talking about and you&rsquo;ll be able to capitalise on it.</p><p> <strong>  DO SOME MARKET RESEARCH </strong></p><p> If you want to get information straight from the source, then you should set up some way of gathering information right from your customers.</p><p> Try sending out surveys, providing polls through social media or, conducting market research that will offer insight into the behaviour of people who buy from you.</p><p> <strong>  LOOK AT INDUSTRY LEADERS </strong></p><p> The leading companies in your industry may be in their position, in part, because they jump on trends before anyone else.</p><p> Keep that in mind when working at identifying business trends.</p><p> You may notice newly adopted practices that are keeping those companies ahead of the game.</p><h3> Be Your Own Superhero. Be Vigilant.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Vigilance is an important quality to have in business management. </strong></p><p> It will serve you well when identifying business trends because it will allow you to catch emerging trends as quickly as possible and maximize your return on them.</p><p> Whilst timing is important, it is merely a function of finding the right balance between supply and demand.</p><p> You need to find the sweet spot when demand exceeds supply. This will make your job easier and provide the runway you&rsquo;ll need to take off, before a market consolidates.</p><p> With this in mind, know you can afford to get a lot of other things wrong, if you get your timing right.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.raymondjames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tash Elwyn  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;This &lsquo;telephone&rsquo; has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.&rdquo; &mdash; William Orton, President of Western Union, 1876 </strong></p><p> Mr. Orton joins several others on a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertszczerba/2015/01/05/15-worst-tech-predictions-of-all-time/\" target=\"_blank\">   list  </a> </u> , published recently on Forbes.com, of the worst tech predictions of all time. At risk of being among those lambasted in just such a list in the future, I&rsquo;d like to make my own prediction:</p><p> Contrary to so much that has been written and said about the rise of the machines and the demise of human financial advice, I believe that the need and demand for personal, face-to-face, human advice will remain. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><p> Money is emotional. Numbers are predictable, rational, constant. Put a dollar sign in front of them, and things change. There&rsquo;s real emotion wrapped up in money &ndash; security, opportunities, dreams. Sure, a computer or  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo-Advisor\" target=\"_blank\">   robo-advisor  </a> </u>  can tell you what you need to do to keep your money and grow it &ndash; it can even do that based on your comfort with risk or a specific goal about wanting to sail around the world, or pay for your twins&rsquo; double wedding. But can it challenge your assumptions, or cut through to what you&rsquo;re really comfortable with before you take risks that you thought were within your comfort level, but weren&rsquo;t?</p><p> <strong>  Financial advice is science and art. </strong>  The fact is, many of the best financial advisors already &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; investment allocation to professional money managers or automatically reallocated portfolios. That&rsquo;s because they know their real value is the art of guiding clients through a decision-making process, helping them resist emotional reactions when markets turn or when personal circumstances cloud judgment. It&rsquo;s a delicate job that requires trust built on personal relationships. <strong>  A computer, even one with advanced algorithms, can only go so far. </strong></p><p> <strong>  People crave connection. </strong>  The Internet has changed our world&hellip; in most ways, for the better. And while it&rsquo;s one of the biggest technology stories in my lifetime, it&rsquo;s also a story of personal connection. There&rsquo;s a reason there are more than 1.35 Billion Facebook users. (Yes, that&rsquo;s Billion. With a &ldquo;B.&rdquo; Rivaling the number of people in the most populous country on Earth, according to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/29/almost-as-many-people-use-facebook-as-live-in-the-entire-country-of-china/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Washington Post  </a> </u> ). <strong>  People want connection, interaction, relationships. While a computer can crunch the numbers, it can&rsquo;t address the nuance that a personal connection can. </strong></p><p> For example,  <u>  Dr. Joseph Coughlin </u> , and his team of researchers at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://agelab.mit.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MIT AgeLab  </a> </u>  are helping financial professionals understand the importance of not only asking, but helping clients understand, the deep planning issues behind three questions:</p><li> <strong>  Who will change my lightbulbs? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How will I get an ice cream cone? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Who will I have lunch with? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Simple questions, perhaps even questions a robo-advisor can ask, but in actuality, these are questions and, more importantly, answers that provoke thoughtful answers and follow up questions that get to the importance of a professional human financial advisor.</p><p> I am a huge technology advocate &ndash; a  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TashElwynRJ/status/576514383150325760\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   gadget geek  </a> </u>  in fact. I believe in the power of technology to improve our lives and can prove it (I have virtually every device available on the market, just ask my wife.) <strong>  But I believe it&rsquo;s available to assist and enhance, not replace. </strong></p><p> <strong>  In financial services, we should embrace what computers do best &ndash; analyzing data and providing insights. </strong> By so doing, we will create additional understanding of our clients, and greater capacity for human interaction that leads to even deeper relationships and better advice.</p><p> This is why I confidently predict that technology won&rsquo;t make our profession obsolete. It&rsquo;s why one of my favorite parts of my job is helping the next generation enter this business &ndash; I&rsquo;m excited about the possibilities yet to come.</p><p> <strong>  Technology will continue to change what we do and how we do it, but it won&rsquo;t change why we do it: to connect with others, and create a meaningful impact on their lives. </strong></p><p> If you found this post interesting, please \"Like,\" Comment,\" \"Share,\" +1 and/or Tweet.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  One source of destructive conflict among partners, especially between founding partners and more junior partners is a succession planning time-line that is not definitive. </strong> In our experience a remarkable number of founders refer to a &ldquo;five-year&rdquo; plan. However, many admit that they have had this vague five-year plan for a least three years, but it remains a five year horizon. This uncertainly can cause great tension with successors who become frustrated but feel they have little leverage.</p><p> For some founders, failure to commit to a plan is based on the inability to answer the fundamental question: <strong>  do I want this firm to survive me? </strong> But even for those who have decided that they want to build a business that survives them, the transition can be difficult.  The extension of succession plan timelines can cause very serious conflict not only with those who are already equity owners and being groomed to take over, but younger staff who are observing career paths.  <strong>  In the worst cases, the legacy that the founders hoped to create is threatened by defections and stagnant growth. </strong></p><p> Even before embarking on a formal plan, a simple but effective starting point is to discuss the transition in terms of specific dates, not relative time. Saying, &ldquo;by June 2016&rdquo; sets a firmer stake than &ldquo;next year.&ldquo; It is then important to meet even minor delegation benchmarks, despite economic or market conditions, client demands, staff changes and other short term events that can be seen as reasons to postpone.</p><p> <strong>  The hesitancy of some founders to formulate and then stick to a defined succession plan is understandable. </strong> A 2008 study at University of California at San Francisco showed that high-achievers are especially reluctant to retire. In the study, only 6% of high-achievers reported wanting to fully retire, more than 50% planned to &ldquo;partially&rsquo; retire.  Partial retirement is an area rife with conflict concerning succession timelines, management decisions, and allocation of resources and it is critical that successors are involved in defining what that looks like, specifically.  Communication regarding succession issues are some of the most difficult conversations a firm&rsquo;s leaders can have, and outside help can prove critical in mooring the rolling five-year succession plan.  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Workflow automation is taking the wealth management industry by storm. Automated account onboarding, digital client signatures and streamlined blotter submissions are just a few innovations that are transforming the way advisors serve their clients.</p><p> <strong>  At an Empower 2015 </strong> panel discussion, Deborah Fox, CEO of Fox Financial Planning, Tim Welsh, President of Nexus Strategy, and Joel Bruckenstein, Founder of Technology Tools for Today, discussed the workflow tools and best practices that are helping wealth management firms gain a competitive edge. Here are three key takeaways from the discussion.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/empower_panelists.png\" width=\"604\"/></p><p> Pictured from left to right: Deborah Fox, CEO of Fox Financial Planning; Timothy Welsh, President of Nexus Strategy and Joel Bruckenstein, Founder of Technology Tools for Today.</p><p> <strong>  1. Workflow Automation Drives Advisor Profits </strong></p><p> The panel emphasized the role of workflow automation in driving profits and productivity. Every hour an advisor spends manually filling out new account forms, tracking down approvals or collecting client signatures can be spent booking new trades or adding clients when automation is in place.</p><p> Deborah stressed that the present time is ripe for automation, adding that advisors following manual processes will be no match for the efficiency of those using workflow.</p><p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait to automate your processes. Don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to do it later,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Workflow automation is catching on quickly, and the firms that recognize that it is an inflection point in the industry will flourish.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2. Next Generation Clients Expect Digital Delivery </strong></p><p> Millennials&mdash;a growing demographic in the investment market&mdash;are accustomed to online communication. Whether they&rsquo;re chatting with a friend or reviewing their latest trading statement, they frequently interact through digital platforms.</p><p> &ldquo;Younger clients don&rsquo;t want to see paper when you deliver financial documents to them,&rdquo; Joel says. &ldquo;They want that information on their smartphones or tablets. They want immediacy.&rdquo;</p><p> With US Social Security benefits  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html\" target=\"_blank\">   projected  </a> </u>  to dry up in 2037, millennials are seeking new long-term investment opportunities. Implementing workflow automation will help advisors compete for this market share by offering the quick, convenient service delivery young investors expect.</p><p> <strong>  3. Analytics Optimize Workflow Efficiency </strong></p><p> With the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.laserfiche.com/ECMBlog/7-highlights-from-the-day-1-keynote-at-empower-2015?utm_medium=ad-digital\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Empower 2015 product demonstrations  </a> </u>  fresh in mind, the panelists buzzed about enhanced reporting capabilities in Laserfiche and how advisors can use them to improve workflow efficiency.</p><p> &ldquo;I was excited to hear about new Laserfiche analytics functionality in yesterday&rsquo;s general session,&rdquo; Joel says. &ldquo;If you have a heat map or dashboard on workflow performance, you can see which users are using workflows effectively and which users are not.&rdquo;</p><p> For instance, charts in Laserfiche Workflow report which steps in a business process take the most time and how they compare to average rates of process completion. When Laserfiche integrates with analytics tools that generate heat maps, this information can produce meaningful patterns that help firms improve workflow performance and maximize profits.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/laserfiche_workflow_report.png\" width=\"709\"/></p><p> This report generated in Laserfiche Workflow shows which steps in a business process take the most time and how they compare to average rates of process completion.</p><p> Want to see how a full-service broker/dealer automates new account onboarding, blotter submissions, advertising approvals and more?

    "content": "<p> <strong>  March 9th marked the sixth anniversary of the current bull market. </strong> Since the average bull market lasts only 3.8 years, we think it may be time to take a look at client portfolios and decide whether it makes sense to incorporate additional safeguards.</p><p> Our last  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.ccmg.com/?p=1630\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Navigator Insights  </a> </u>  discussed taking a personalized approach to risk management. Just as the markets go up and down, investors&rsquo; appetite for risk goes up and down. A personalized risk management approach will adjust and adapt to the changing markets based upon the desired outcome or goal of the client. There are a variety of ways to manage volatility, and each has its pros and cons.</p><h3> Pros &amp; Cons of Risk Reduction Tools</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Time  </strong> can manage volatility, since over long periods of time, the effects of market spikes are smoothed out. Using a bucket approach to asset management can help spread a client&rsquo;s risk out throughout their investing lifecycle. But not every investor has the luxury of a long time horizon nor do they always have the emotional fortitude to just &ldquo;stick it out&rdquo; in a bear market.</p><p> <strong>  Bonds </strong>  have traditionally been used as a volatility mitigation tool to help provide an income stream and to lower the overall risk of the portfolio. However, the threat of rising interest rates may mean higher volatility in the bond markets. Investors should not expect to receive the same benefits that they received over the past 30 years of a declining rate environment. Rates simply don&rsquo;t have any lower to go.</p><p> <strong>  Alternatives  </strong> can help incorporate non-correlated asset classes into a portfolio. But the alternative category is all-encompassing, containing many different types of investments. It&rsquo;s important to truly understand the individual characteristics of the alternative investments you&rsquo;re incorporating to know how they will complement the overall portfolio and react in different market scenarios.</p><p> <strong>  Hedging vehicles </strong> , such as products that track the VIX Index, can provide a way to access areas of the market that are negatively correlated to the equity markets. Hedging strategies are used to protect investors from severe market declines. However, in an up market or sideways market, they may create drag on the portfolio. It&rsquo;s important to use them correctly and set the proper expectations with investors.</p><p> We believe one or all of the above vehicles can provide risk management for an investor.</p><p> Considering the full spectrum of risk management tools available when building asset allocations can help ensure that clients make the right decisions about their money regardless of market conditions.</p>",

    "content": "<p> LinkedIn has become an essential tool for businesses and individuals all over the world, having jumped from 4,500 members in its first month to nearly 350 million now.</p><p> No matter what you use it for - whether it's to find sales prospects, jobs, or to stay in touch with others in your industry - LinkedIn offers up a world of business opportunities. <strong>  But are you using it correctly? </strong> Are you sure about that?</p><p> Business experts Inc.com recently published an article on the LinkedIn truths all professionals should know &ndash; let's take a closer look at what they reveal...</p><p> <strong>  1. Sorry, not everybody is desperate to know you </strong></p><p> It's easy to get carried away when you first join LinkedIn and start trying to connect with everybody; but some users might be offended by receiving requests from people they've never met. While some friendly folk are happy to meet new people and connections, others will view it as a waste of their time and even an invasion of their privacy. So err on the side of caution and only connect with people you have met or spoken to in 'real life,' - or at the very least you have a mutual connection with.</p><p> <strong>  2. First impressions matter </strong></p><p> Remember the essentials: have a professional headshot profile picture (no silly faces or puppies/children/alcoholic beverages...); customise your page URL; include personal recommendations and details about your experience and expertise.</p><p> <strong>  3. Death of the salesman? </strong></p><p> People are becoming more savvy to advertising these days, and most of us dislike the thought of being sold to. Avoid messages or connection attempts that come across as 'salesy' or you risk putting people off; instead, write unique content that shows you are a real person looking to make real connections. And most importantly, be yourself.</p><p> <strong>  4. Become a groupie </strong></p><p> Personal profiles and private messages only get you so far. Groups can be a powerful way to reach out to large numbers of new people without p**ing anybody off - join as many as you think appropriate (50 is the current LinkedIn limit), and establish your voice and personality by joining in with comment threads or starting your own conversation. Before you know it, you'll have more connections than before - and you might even be inspired to start up a group of your own!</p><p> <strong>  5. Next time it's personal </strong></p><p> Start each new connection off on the right foot by sending a brief message, for example explaining why why making that connection means something to you. The default LinkedIn message is cold, impersonal and frankly quite boring. After that, remember to communicate with your connections regularly - e.g. congratulating them on work anniversary or promotion, and so on. It doesn't take a lot of effort but can go a long way towards keeping you front of mind and deepening business relationships.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Take a look at what&rsquo;s on your calendar today or tomorrow. </strong> Is it filled with meetings that you have either been invited to or initiated where the goal is to make a company decision? Are you the only one in the company that can make that decision? Probably not, but you don&rsquo;t trust anyone else to make that decision because whenever you have, you&rsquo;ve been let down, so you stopped letting anyone else make the decisions.</p><p> A full calendar, and decision making resting with you and you alone, forces a ceiling on both you and the business. It means you&rsquo;re not free to ponder the bigger questions of the business, strategize its growth or take the meetings that match your skill set and position. As a result, staff members rarely voice opinions any longer as they don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ll react to their suggestions. This is a common situation, especially in owner operated businesses. The business is your baby and you&rsquo;re the only one that can raise it properly. Of course that thinking is just in your head. You had the vision to start the business but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to manage veery aspect of it. There are many tasks in my business that I could do because I know how, but I choose not to, instead focusing my time where it will benefit the business most.</p><p> <strong>  Oftentimes, the reason for this micromanagement comes down to a lack of a cohesive, unified vision, set of values and mission for the company that employees not only buy into, but are the biggest advocates of. </strong> We need rails and fences to keep us where we need to be going or where we need to remain. We seek out and yearn for structure so that we can utilize our talents to help best exemplify and achieve the standards and goals shared by the company and as a company leader, you are being looked to to provide these guides.</p><p> The solution is easier than you might think and the results are dramatic. <strong>  This solution requires you to remove as much subjectivity from your vision, mission and goals as possible. </strong> In doing so, you create the framework for employees to help you achieve your goals without constant intervention or micromanagement. But it takes discipline and belief. You must believe in yourself and the company enough to want to do it. The greatest joy in my business comes from seeing the faces of business leaders after undertaking the work to articulate the company&rsquo;s position, vision and values, who are free to pursue the bigger picture goals, free to grow the company, safe in the knowledge that everyone understands where they are going. That feeling is amazing!</p><p> <strong>  When the vision and purpose are clear, strategies become easier and tactics become second nature. </strong> Measurement of every aspect becomes possible now that there&rsquo;s something to measure against, it becomes easier to hire, fire and invest in areas that help achieve the stated, documented and shared goals. Staff start to think about new and different ways to reach targets, management considers new business opportunities to explore and all because everyone now knows what the company stands for and where it is going.</p><p> In our Brandforging process, we use a proprietary set of tools and strategies to help companies achieve margin and preference. In this process, marketing tactics and the things normally rushed to in times of greatest need, are three quarters the way into the process. You see, without the foundation laid, we have no business building walls and erecting roofs. <strong>  The consequences would be dire. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> You&rsquo;ve just nailed your latest appointment. Your newest clients-in-waiting are on board. They see the value of the advice you&rsquo;re providing. They&rsquo;re clear on the costs and the process. Their financial problems are on the verge of being dealt with. All that remains is a spot of data gather, a few applications, a little bit elbow grease and they&rsquo;re on the way.</p><p> Days pass. You call. No response. An email. Same result. Another phone call goes to voicemail with no call back. Soon enough, weeks have passed and the client remains lodged in your pipeline like a barnacle on a boat.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve been caught in the Procrastination Zone. </strong></p><p> Procrastination is yet another one of those issues that holds back not just advice businesses, but also clients. In many ways, it&rsquo;s a bit like paying bills. Many of us naturally hold off until the last minute before paying them, regardless of the fact we could do so earlier. Often we run the risk of missing the due date, incurring late fees in the process.</p><p> The same can be true of advice, the difference being that waiting too long to implement the right advice can mean missing the opportunity altogether.</p><p> From working with advice businesses, I&rsquo;ve found that getting on the front foot in addressing client procrastination is a good habit to adopt. It helps create better engagement, demonstrating to the client a mastery of &ldquo;getting it done&rdquo; and a deeper commitment to making sure they take real action that is in their best interests.</p><p> So, what practical steps can you take to help clients avoid putting off key decisions until tomorrow?</p><p> <strong>  1. Never end a meeting without asking &ldquo;What do I need to explain better?&rdquo; </strong>  In making a decision to engage your services, there are two factors that influence a person&rsquo;s decision. One is known as buyer acceptance, the other is buyer reluctance. Buyer acceptance is achieved by the client accepting the upside of what you have to offer and your ability to deliver. Buyer reluctance is about the client rationalising all the reasons that may exist that would stop them from engaging. Of the two, the latter is more powerful. If you don&rsquo;t address all those reasons in the clients head as to why they shouldn&rsquo;t pay your fees, take your advice and send back the information you ask for, there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll fall into procrastination. The solution is to make sure you are extracting via questioning all the things they don&rsquo;t really understand about what you&rsquo;re proposing but won&rsquo;t admit until skilfully prompted.</p><p> <strong>  2. Follow up within 24-48 hours. </strong>  Client enthusiasm for acting is never greater than the moment they walk out of meeting with you. Every moment that passes reduces their likelihood of acting. If you want to find the root cause of the reason why a client has been stuck in pipeline limbo for the past six months, it usually lies in what is done within the first 24-48 hours after meeting. A summary email, identifying specifically defined action items for both your business AND the client is a great way of turning a discussion into action.</p><p> <strong>  3. Ask for a preferred communication medium. </strong>  Some people live on email. Others never set foot near a computer but carry a smartphone with them everywhere. Many hate texting but will gladly answer a call. Some will answer a call but only at certain times. By taking time to inquire what might be the best way to get in contact, not only do you maximise your chances of choosing the right medium, but you also prime the client to expect contact.</p><p> <strong>  4. Ask for permission. </strong>  We all have the greatest of intentions. I don&rsquo;t purposefully ignore my accountants email asking me to get back some piece of information they need. In fact, I appreciate his persistence, but I end up feeling guilty about not coming back to him and so the procrastination cycle continues. A simple solution is to ask, &ldquo;Do I have your permission to keep following you up?&rdquo; By asking permission it transforms incessant pestering into a service provided with the purpose of achieving a commonly agreed objective.</p><p> <strong>  5. Talk about the effort required. </strong>  Behind the scenes of your business, a lot of stuff goes on that clients have absolutely no idea about. Sometimes they may even think that it&rsquo;s so simple that they can leave you to your own devices with no need for their input. This is a perception that can be addressed head on by talking to the client about the level of input required at each stage of the process. If there is clear understanding that you need a significant amount of their input early on, but not so much later on, it puts the emphasis on the need for them to act promptly when needed.</p>",

In recent years, we have given so much emphasis to dotting the i's and crossing the t's, and enhancing our technical capability, and developing robust and detailed plans that will stand judicial scrutiny, that I suspect there IS a real issue with a high proportion of clients being unable to categorically answer the key financial planning value question: <strong>  Are you on track to achieve what you wanted and planned to achieve? </strong></p><p> When we get right down to it, not much else matters in financial planning from the client's perspective, does it? The planning process, and the plan itself, exists to assist the client achieve their defined goals.</p><p> <strong>  What if 60 percent of your clients were unable to state that they were on track to meet their defined financial planning goals? What if those 60 percent decided that perhaps the whole financial planning thing was a waste of money? </strong></p><p> There is certainly a widely held consumer perception that financial planning costs too much, and there is an ever increasing scrutiny upon financial adviser costs.</p><p> The first thing any smart adviser should do do is make sure that every single existing, ongoing, fee-paying client is absolutely sure that they know where they stand in relation to achieving their goals. All the brilliant marketing, and extra client communication touch points, and clever strategies are no substitute for the one thing that really matters in the typical clients mind: Am I getting closer to the life I planned?</p><p> Build all client communications, reviews and portfolio reports around this single simple question, and there will be little questioning of reasonable planning fees. </p>",

I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why, but I suspect it may be because many just aren&rsquo;t aware of all the benefits.Here are five great reasons why women should consider a career in financial services: <strong>  1. WOMEN EXCEL AT BUILDING AND NURTURING LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS </strong> This is a business built on relationships. Women tend to be very strong communicators, and they excel at building and nurturing long-term relationships, one of the most important skill sets a financial advisor can have. Women are accustomed to giving and getting referrals. We do that with our friends, our family, and our business colleagues.We also naturally work in a team environment. Clients today like knowing that they have a long-term relationship with someone who is backed by a whole team of people who can help them. The days of working in a silo are long gone. <strong>  2. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK </strong> There&rsquo;s a lot of controversy about equal pay for equal work. Generally,  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap#United_States\" target=\"_blank\">   women earn only 77 percent of what men earn  </a> </u>  for the same work.However, the financial services industry does not distinguish gender when you&rsquo;re talking about pay-for-performance. In our industry, you get compensated based on the success you have in building client relationships and how hard you work, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re a man or a woman. Even today, where the headlines read that women still are not receiving equal pay, that problem doesn&rsquo;t exist for women who become advisors in the life insurance industry. Because the commissions are regulated, it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for an insurance firm to pay a man more than a woman. <strong>  3. WORK/LIFE BALANCE </strong> Personally, one of the things that really attracted me to the business was the ability to have it all-to have a family and still be able to have a very successful career. I don&rsquo;t think many other professions offer that. This was a critical factor for me, and it&rsquo;s an element that I think would attract a lot more women if they were aware of it.Although you have to work very hard early on to build your practice, just as you would if you were an attorney or a doctor, you have a lot of autonomy and independence in determining your work/life balance because you can set appointments with clients based on your schedule. You can work certain days of the week or certain times of the day and still be able to go to your children&rsquo;s events or to check in on an elderly parent.If someone asked me whether this is something you can do part-time, my response would be that this is a results-driven business. If you can achieve the performance and the results, no one worries about the time you put in doing it. When my kids were younger, I could get just as much work done by working three days a week, because I was totally focused on doing only what I needed to do so I could get home to my kids. <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.pennmutual.com/author/eileen-c-mcdonnell/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Eileen McDonnell, Penn Mutual&rsquo;s CEO  </a> </u> , recently spoke about whether this can be a part-time job. She said that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter how many hours you put in. What matters is the outcome of your work, and I&rsquo;m a big believer in that.  <u>  <a href=\"/category/workforce/career-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   In our agency  </a> </u> , for example, if people need to spend a certain amount of time making appointments to see new clients, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to us whether they&rsquo;re making those calls from home or from the office. As long as the outcome and the productivity are there, it isn&rsquo;t relevant to us whether someone is sitting in their cubicle or in their home office while making those calls. <strong>  4. A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF OTHERS </strong> It&rsquo;s important to have a passion for your work, to have a sense of mission. I&rsquo;m always amazed at the impact that our agency has on the lives of our clients. We are helping them educate their kids for college, retire successfully, and leave a legacy while also protecting them from the unforeseen things that happen. We&rsquo;re the only ones who are really delivering the check when someone becomes disabled or passes on, enabling a family or a business to pick up and carry on towards the goals and dreams that a person may have had for the people they loved. There&rsquo;s really no other business that compares to that, except perhaps medicine. <strong>  5. THE NEED HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER </strong> The industry needs to attract new people. The average insurance agent is a 57-year-old white male. There a number of problems with that. First, the U.S. workforce as a whole is much younger and more diverse, and the industry needs to keep pace in order to serve its clients better. For example, some older men overlook the financial contributions that women make in the modern household today, which has resulted in an insurance gap between men and women.The women that I know in the business don&rsquo;t shy away from the impact a woman has, and also the need she has for insurance. Whether a woman is working at a particular job or profession, or if she is a stay-at-home mom, there&rsquo;s a huge value to what she does that would need to be replaced if something happened to her.Second, a lot of current financial advisors will soon begin retiring and will need to be replaced. It&rsquo;s estimated that the industry will need 237,000 advisors over the next decade simply to replace the ones who will be retiring. This will naturally create more diversity in the industry, and better opportunities than ever for women.For all these reasons, becoming a financial advisor in the financial services industry can be a great career for women of all ages and backgrounds. The need has never been greater, and women excel at doing this sort of relationship-based, team-oriented work. The work also enables women to have tremendous control of their work/life balance, and they get compensated equally based on their performance. Finally, it allows women to make a positive impact on the lives of others, while enjoying a passion for what they do.If you want to learn more about a career in financial services, visit  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.pennmutual.com/financial-professionals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.pennmutual.com  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/course/gaining-commitments\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gaining commitments  </a> </u> : it can be a natural part of consultative sales when you apply the principles correctly. But sometimes there are challenges. As a sales professional, you may feel as if you're using your sales skills effectively, and that your calls are going really well. But somehow getting to that commitment isn't happening as consistently as you would like. You don't want to be pushy (which isn't effective), but you do want to gain commitments from customers.</p><p> Developing the sales skills that gain commitments involves learning to recognize buying signs and use certain &ldquo;convincer strategies&rdquo; to confirm the sale. Start with the mindset that \"closing\" isn't a singular event. In fact, with insightful sales solutions, closing takes place at every step of the sales process, whenever you take the opportunity to reinforce decisions and gain commitments. The final close is important, but it's not everything.</p><p> Here are some things to keep in mind when you face challenges in gaining customer commitments.</p><p> <strong>  Reassess: Have You Covered All the Bases? </strong></p><p> First, reassess whether you have covered all the processes that go into successful consultative selling:</p><li> Pre-Call Planning - Before contacting a customer, consider expected outcomes and set your contact objectives. Prepare questions that guide the sale, and have a strategy for influencing customer questions. Be sure to research changes that are happening in your customer&rsquo;s business so you can position potential solutions that are relevant. <br/>  </li><li> Call Openings - Are you building rapport, striving to understand the customer's communication style? Are you clear about why you're contacting them and the potential value that you bring? <br/>  </li><li> Discovering Needs - Do you have a sound understanding of the customer's business, their needs, and the value you can offer? They may not tell you their needs, and in fact may not entirely know what they are.  <br/>  </li><li> Positioning Solutions - Are you discussing solutions that add value for that particular customer? This is an ongoing process and involves doing some upfront research, spending time with them and asking smart questions. <br/>  </li><li> Handling Stalls and Closing on Actions - When you make recommendations, you may encounter objections. The first step is to avoid defensiveness. So for instance, if someone were to object to your price, you could say something like, &ldquo;Price is important, Let&rsquo;s take a look at it.&rdquo; That will help get the customer moving with you rather than against. Then you can clarify to get to the heart of the issue by asking open-ended questions like, &ldquo;What are you comparing it to? Or How much too much is it?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><li> Following Up - You may have to initiate actions that were promised during the sales process. Here you work to solidify action from the customer, and following through on what you said you would do can set you apart from the competition. Make sure you have a good internal communication system for keeping your pulse on implementation. <br/>  </li><li> Fine-Tuning Strategy - Each customer contact is a chance to uncover information that can advance the sales strategy. Every new commitment is an opportunity to ask yourself what the next sales objective is for the account. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How Coaching Can Help </strong></p><p> Training expands your knowledge base, while coaching is more personal and deals with specific behaviors. Coaching is a matter of putting what you've learned into practice and receiving feedback and insights for moving forward. Since salespeople often operate independently, it is important for sales people to coach themselves after each call. Start with reinforcing what went well and then evaluate what you will change. If you get into this habit, it will become a natural part of your sales process. There is also benefit to receiving sales coaching from peers, sales managers and other experts. In Consultative Sales Certification, we hold online meetings where participants share successes and give each other feedback under the direction of an expert coach. Collectively, the group has all the answers to any sales situation you might face. If you are having difficulty moving a sale forward, pose the situation to your peers and managers. Most likely someone in the group will have faced the same issue at one point and may be able to help you walk through solutions.</p><p> <strong>  Know that Closing Doesn't Just Happen </strong></p><p> Sometimes, the only thing that gets in the way of commitments is lack of taking action. &ldquo;This (participating in CSC) has helped me realize why we aren&rsquo;t closing. Before, we would go into a sale and feel like it felt good and then nothing would happen. So now we plan sales so we are able to plan for commitments and know when to ask for them,&rdquo; said Tari Warwick, Sales Operations Manager-Sashco and recent Consultative Sales Certification (CSC) graduate. If you are closing sales without taking action, then you should feel very blessed. Some of the most effective actions to take are simply getting small commitments throughout the entire process and interactions with your customers. Getting little yes&rsquo;s along the way makes the big yes easier. Recognizing and acting on simple buying signs is also very important to your ability to gain commitments. For instance, if a customer asks you to review details of your solution, that is a positive buying sign. They wouldn't bother if they weren't interested. Another positive buying sign is when customers lean forward. This is a sign of confidence and may be an opportunity to affirm decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Reestablish and Demonstrate Value </strong></p><p> When you're working toward gaining a customer commitment, you may have to reestablish value. Remind the customer that they currently do not have the benefit your solution offers. If you've established rapport, your solution will be accepted more easily. Go back to your initial needs assessment. What potential solution do you offer to the customer to either alleviate a problem or to help them gain more. You may need to calculate out the exact gains. For instance, I just received a new insurance quote. While everything looked good, I did not have urgency to take action until the agent showed me exactly what I was going to be saving in a year. Then, be ready to follow with a simple closing question like, &ldquo;What is preventing you from moving forward right now?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Break It Down </strong></p><p> Sometimes when commitment to a sale appears far off, you have to wonder: is this account worth hanging in there for? If you conclude that it is, then you may consider breaking your value-oriented selling down into smaller, simpler steps. What small commitment could you expect from this potential customer, and how can you pursue that? From there you can add another small goal, working steadily toward the commitment for purchase. By accepting smaller wins, it also enables you to demonstrate how good you are.</p><p> <strong>  Convincer Strategies </strong></p><p> The icing on the cake is really knowing how each and every person is influenced. Some people are influenced by testimonials from others, some from proof, some from the need for change and a myriad of other &ldquo;convincer strategies&rdquo;. While you can, and should, learn the formal convincer strategies aligned to consultative selling, it really is as simple as paying attention to the behavior of your customers. If they have asked you for a demonstration or proof in the past, chances are they will be influenced by the same for future considerations. Don&rsquo;t wait for them to ask you &ndash; armed with this information, take action and watch your closing rates increase!</p><p> <strong>  Conclusion </strong></p><p> Gaining commitment is at the heart of value-added selling, and sometimes gaining commitments can be challenging. But when your sales skills include reassessing and ensuring you've covered the bases, working with a coach on specific sales skills, establishing and demonstrating value for customers, and occasionally breaking the \"sale\" commitment down into smaller commitments, you can meet these challenges effectively.</p><p> Insightful sales solutions are central to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.getcsc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CSC  </a> </u> 's consultative sales certification coaching, a comprehensive program that coaches the sales professional on core competencies and specific sales skills they need every day.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  I find it hard to recall a time when I didn&rsquo;t Google, send a text message or even deposit a check without leaving my office. </strong> The last two decades have generated innumerable technological innovations that have enhanced our daily lives, not to mention the way many companies conduct business.</p><p> Industries across the globe scrupulously try to understand if and how any of these new tools and devices can improve operations. Will the cloud help streamline processes? The internet of everything is seemingly everywhere&mdash;should we care and how? Some companies instantly jump on the bandwagon and embrace new technologies, while others take time to shift company culture, change perception and adjust operations and processes.</p><p> Regardless of which side you&rsquo;re on at the moment&mdash;jumping in blindly or testing the waters, it is important to, at the very least, identify and understand all the new tools entering the marketplace. With mobility trends continuously on the rise and client expectations evolving, companies have no choice but to change the way they run their businesses.</p><p> As a wealth manager, I have seen a number of new products enter the financial realm over the past decade&mdash;from financial planning software and Client Relationship Manager (CRM) programs to account aggregation, document management tools and mobile apps. And while our industry, as a whole, has embraced the concept of emerging technologies, we still have a long way to go to shift antiquated perceptions and ensure many financial advisors and wealth managers are implementing new solutions. Not only can these tools enable us to service our clients better, but they can also significantly improve our operations and make our jobs easier and more efficient. In fact, findings from a recent Fidelity survey showed that one-third of investors would switch advisors if they weren&rsquo;t active technology users.</p><p> While different industry professionals will continue to ask questions about which technology to use and how, I put together a few reasons as to why:</p><p> <strong>  Efficiency. </strong> Automation technology offers speed and accessibility, helping advisors access data and communicate with clients at any time and from any location. Not only can it help advisors stay organized and on top of their workload and client needs, but it also frees up their time. Similarly, CRM enables advisors to more effectively and efficiently manage their practice by streamlining tasks and managing client information, while various financial planning software eliminate redundant manual processes, such as having to re-enter client information into separate systems </p><p> <strong>  Connect with Clients. </strong> With technology handling many of the jobs we used to do manually, we have more time to take on a wider range of clients and spend more time with them, building relationships with existing clients and seeking out new business. For instance, much of investment management can be implemented with technology these days. We no longer need to sit behind a computer screen and enter trades all day. We can focus on comprehensive planning and working with our clients face to face. Additionally, with so many next generation investors already expecting us to have the latest tools and communication methods, it&rsquo;s to our advantage to showcase our expertise in these tools and connect with clients in a preferred matter&mdash;with some even via text messaging. This all adds up to a better customer experience and improved client service&mdash;and in a crowded space, that personal touch can make a world of a difference in your business.</p><p> <strong>  Mitigate Risk. </strong> We&rsquo;ve all seen the rapid cloud progression&mdash;with businesses moving to the cloud to streamline operations, lower cost, improve service levels and, of course, security. As we embrace new technologies, we access tools that protect client information, which is critical in our business. No longer do we need to have drawers full paperwork and confidential documents stored on local computers&mdash;we can take advantage of secured infrastructures and still have access to data 24/7. Financial planning software can also minimize entry errors&mdash;instead of performing financial planning and analysis manually on an excel spreadsheet, we can use new programs and reduce the potential for error.</p><p> In addition to the benefits listed above, the use of emerging technologies can be a major differentiator for your business. Clients expect us to be forward-thinking. Embracing new technologies, including instant communication methods, shows them we are on the forefront of our industry.</p><p> <strong>  Our job is to service clients and offer sophisticated solutions to improve their financial well-being, helping them sleep better at night. </strong> Many new tools exist to help us become more efficient, effective, and accessible, creating a better experience for our clients. At the end of the day, the ROI gained from happy clients (and their immediate families, friends and colleagues) can far outweigh the costs in researching and implementing the new technologies.</p>",

Another issue to consider when deciding among policies is what coverage may already be in place under other insurance policies such as a Fidelity Bond or D&amp;O/E&amp;O Liability policy as to whether you need these coverages under your Cyber Liability Policy. For instance, the primary intent of a Fidelity Bond or Commercial Crime Policy is to protect your firm against financial loss due to a dishonest act of an employee. The D&amp;O (Directors &amp; Officers Liability) policy is designed to protect your firm against loss for issues such as lack of due diligence or breach of duty by your firm and its employees. In other words, what due diligence have you done to ensure that your clients&rsquo; personally identifiable information is secure with the vendors or independent contractors utilized?</p><p> <strong>  Yerzak: </strong> What minimum insuring agreements should be included?</p><p> <strong>  Fotopulos: </strong> Again, this is a factor influenced by the existence of other insurance contracts you may have in place. Some of the basic insuring agreements under a Cyber Liability Policy include Network Security &amp; Privacy, Breach Response Costs, Network Asset Protection, Reputational Expense, Regulatory Defense &amp; Penalties, Multimedia Insurance, as well as Cyber Extortion and Cyber Terrorism. Buyer beware, all insurance policies have an &ldquo;other insurance&rdquo; provision within the policy that states that their policy may not apply or only apply as excess to any other collectible insurance policy. Coordinating coverage can prevent disputes among carriers.</p><p> <strong>  Yerzak: </strong> Does the adviser need to encrypt everything in order to be approved for a policy?</p><p> <strong>  Fotopulos: </strong> Whether the insurance policy itself goes into &ldquo;encryption&rdquo; requirements or not, every policy has what we refer to as the &ldquo;Uniform Commercial Code&rdquo; Exclusion. Common policy language states, there is no coverage for loss based upon, arising from, or in any way involving the actual or alleged government enforcement of any state or federal regulation including, but not limited to, regulations promulgated by the United States Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, etc. Article 4A, under the Uniform Commercial Code requires encryption when it comes to Wire Transfers.</p><p> <strong>  Yerzak: </strong> Generally, who should report a cybersecurity incident to the carrier, and what is the timing for such reporting?</p><p> <strong>  Fotopulos: </strong> There is no standardized wording but the more narrow the definition of &ldquo;who becomes aware of the situation&rdquo; before the reporting requirement kicks-in, the better. Some policies state that you have to report within 60 days when an employee becomes aware of the event that may cause a loss. If the event is not immediately brought to the attention of the person familiar with the insurance policy requirements, policy provisions may be violated thus void coverage. Other insurance policies state that the Risk Manager, General Counsel, or a senior officer or director of the firm must first become aware of the event before the reporting provision clock starts ticking. This is also where your firm's Written Policies and Procedures&rsquo; escalation requirements need to be coordinated with your insurance policy reporting provisions. Coverage for forensic investigation and data breach notification costs are essentials when purchasing a Cyber Liability Policy, but you need to be aware of whether or not the limits are within or in addition to the policy limit of liability. Specific to data breach notification, there may be restrictions in terms of the number of individuals, records or a sub-limit of liability that applies.</p><p> <strong>  Yerzak: </strong> Are policies calculated based on number of clients, number of records, number of employees, type of data?</p><p> <strong>  Fotopulos: </strong> The insurance industry has not come-up with a unified method of determining the cost for this policy. Employee count, records, transactions, and annual revenues are some of the various factors insurer&rsquo;s utilize to rate a risk. The key is coordinating your various insurance policies to ensure you have the right protection for your unique risk and that the firm&rsquo;s Written Policies and Procedures are coordinated with your insurance policies. Due diligence is a continuous process and needs to be performed at many and various levels not only to properly protect your firm but you as CCO.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<strong> To some, WorldCentric, a Petaluma, CA &ndash; based company that makes and sells compostable products, might look as though it were trying to put itself out of business.</strong>It started out in 2004 as a not for profit dedicated to raising awareness about environmental and humanitarian problems. In 2009, it converted to a for profit corporation and then to a certified B Corporation. Today a core element of its business model is to give a minimum of 25% of its annual gross profits to grassroots social and environmental organizations. Actually, in 2011 WorldCentric gave away 38%; in 2012, 90%. But that&rsquo;s still not enough. The company says its ultimate target is &ldquo;to give 100% of our net profits over the coming years to positively affect our world and environment.&rdquo; For comparison, the average rate of corporate giving in America, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics, is 6.5%.WorldCentric is a striking example of what Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter calls shared value: it creates social and economic benefits simultaneously. In a 2011 article in the Harvard Business Review, Porter explains that classical economics assumes that social progress and economic efficiency are fundamentally opposed: spending money on the former imposes a constraint on the latter. It&rsquo;s true that many companies have established worthwhile corporate social responsibility programs. No matter how beneficial these may be, however, they tend to be peripheral to the company&rsquo;s main business, and are typically managed, evaluated and funded primarily as PR efforts.<strong> A matter of scale</strong>As reported in<a href=\"/ideas/insights/a-higher-kind-of-capitalism\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Part 1 of this article </u></a>, governments, NGOs and philanthropies simply don&rsquo;t have the scale to mount an effective response to such global problems as poor nutrition, access to water, climate change, deforestation, lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food, not enough healthcare, pollution, etc. Only business does, argues Porter. But before it can begin to make a real impact, it needs to be convinced that combining mission-driven and profit-driven represents a huge business opportunity &ndash; and possibly the most important one we&rsquo;ll ever see.Porter is not alone in advancing this argument. A growing number of organizations are working to help corporations marry purpose and profit. They include B Lab, creator of the Certified B Corporation; The B Team, backed by Richard Branson; Conscious Capitalism, backed by John Mackey of Whole Foods, and even the august World Economic Forum. And don&rsquo;t forget the Vatican. Believers and deniers alike anxiously await the encyclical on climate change Pope Francis has promised to release later this year.Even the combined talents and resources of such powerful allies will not bring about results overnight. But signs of change are evident in three broad trends.<strong> 1. Consumers</strong>The first of these involves consumers. The more they insist on buying socially responsible goods and services, the more of a force for change they&rsquo;ll become. Research indicates that &ldquo;conscious consumerism&rdquo; is on the rise. In a study conducted by Good.Must.Grow, a marketing consulting firm, 62% of the sample of 1,010 Americans said that buying from socially responsible companies was important. At the same time, though, 45% of respondents said that the biggest obstacle -- outranking availability, price, quality, selection and trust -- is that it&rsquo;s hard to know which products and services actually qualify. The proliferation of labels and badges that certify organic, humane, recycled, renewable, compostable, and minority-owned, among numerous other attributes, may not be entirely helpful. Combined with all the social media buttons increasingly seen on packaging, advertising and websites, those endorsements may make products as colorful as a NASCAR racer but don&rsquo;t help consumers distinguish between greenwash and the real thing.Indeed, the clearest indication coming from current consumer research is that shoppers don&rsquo;t trust business. According to the latest Harris Reputation Survey, only 1 in 5 Americans feels the reputation of Corporate America has improved in the past year. The 2015 edition of the Edelman Trust Barometer echoes that sentiment and finds a &ldquo;profound concern&rdquo; on the part of consumers about the pace of new developments in business, particularly hydraulic fracturing and genetically modified foods. The APCO Worldwide Champion Brand Survey shows clearly that consumers take a company&rsquo;s practices and policies into account before deciding whether or not to buy a product. To help consumers make purchase decisions aligned with their values, a company called Spend Consciously recently launched its BuyPartisan mobile app. BuyPartisan scans the bar code of dozens of popular supermarket products and produces a report on the user&rsquo;s smartphone detailing the political spending of the company&rsquo;s CEO, Board of Directors, PAC and employees.<strong> 2. Millennials</strong>Millennials, born between 1980 and 2000, undoubtedly comprise a portion of the conscious consumer segment, but their growing impact in the workplace offers an even stronger promise of transformations to come. Although the press may hyperbolize this generation into creatures that represent a wholly new species of human, there&rsquo;s nevertheless plenty of evidence that Millennials have ideas of their own. &ldquo;At Facebook, Boss Is A Dirty Word,&rdquo; headlined the Wall Street Journal, for instance, in an article describing the management techniques the social media company has developed for its 8,000 mostly 30-and-under employees.&ldquo;The message is clear,&rdquo; says Deloitte in its 2015 Millennial Survey of 7,900 respondents around the world: &ldquo;when looking at their career goals, today&rsquo;s Millennials are just as interested in how a business develops its people and its contribution to society as they are in its products and profits.&rdquo; Deloitte reports that 75% of Millennials believe businesses are too fixated on their own agendas and not focused enough on helping to improve society. Other surveys, ranging from The 2014 Millennial Impact Report to the 2015 Leadership Report from the U.K. creative and strategy consultants Wolff Olins (&lsquo;How Leaders Are Creating The Uncorporation&rdquo;) point in a similar direction.Particularly striking are the findings from a study conducted by the London Business School. Annually for five years LBS asked Millennials enrolled in one of its executive development programs to indicate which of five general options they would focus on if they were CEOs. Results:How do I make my organization and the world a better place: 43%Thinking entrepreneurially: 33%Minding the core business: 11.5%The global impact of the business: 11.5%Maximizing return to shareholders: 1%As Weber Shandwick&rsquo;s chief reputation strategist Leslie Gaines-Ross observes, &ldquo;Purpose is going to be hard core for this population segment.&rdquo;<strong> 3. Investors</strong>The indifference shown by these future business leaders to shareholder value points to the third trend, which revolves around what is probably the most influential driver of business behavior: how the capital markets measure &ndash; and reward -- performance. For nearly 50 years, managers and investors alike have viewed the creation of wealth for stockholders as a company&rsquo;s only social responsibility. Many have considered it an actual legal requirement, and still do. But it&rsquo;s not, argues Lynn Stout, a Distinguished Professor at Cornell Law School and author of an influential book published in 2012 called, unambiguously,<u> The Shareholder Value Myth</u>. &ldquo;Contrary to what many believe,&rdquo; she has written, &ldquo;U.S. corporate law does not impose any enforceable legal duty on corporate directors or executives of public corporations to maximize profits or share price.&rdquo;Theoretically, liberating corporate managers from the relentless pursuit of share price increases is potentially a giant leap in the direction of shared value. Pragmatically, though, if shareholder value alone isn&rsquo;t the right metric for encouraging and measuring responsible corporate performance, what is? For socially conscious companies trying to raise capital, as well as for the individuals, institutions and funds that have already committed nearly $6.6 trillion to socially responsible investments in the U.S., this is not a trivial question. Numerous efforts are currently underway worldwide to establish, among other things, common definitions, data collection tools and standards, regulations and reporting requirements, rating and weighting systems, models, metrics and analytics &ndash; and ways to make all these work harmoniously across markets, asset classes and geographic boundaries.&ldquo;The model is still quite new,&rdquo; says Michael van Patten, Founder and President of Mission Markets, a certified B Corporation and pioneer in the mission-focused investments arena. &ldquo;Today it&rsquo;s dominated by the very wealthy, it&rsquo;s highly illiquid and risky, and information is limited.&rdquo; Attracting mainstream investors and service providers is important, he adds, but there&rsquo;s currently no infrastructure that would allow that tohappen in a meaningful way.<strong> The Start of A New Era</strong>&ldquo;In a sense, all investing is impact investing,&rdquo; says Erika Karp, founder and CEO of Cornerstone Capital, an advisory and research firm and a leading voice in the field of sustainable investing and finance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that not all of it is conscious.&rdquo; The question, according to Steve Lydenberg, a partner at Domini Social Investments who spoke recently at a meeting hosted by Cornerstone, is whether impact investing is merely a change of degrees &ndash; a new technique &ndash; or whether it&rsquo;s part of a more fundamental shift in our financial system.As scientists consider switching the name of our current geological era from &ldquo;Holocene&rdquo; to &ldquo;Anthropocene,&rdquo; to indicate that human activity is now the dominant force affecting life on our planet (and not for the better), impact investing needs to do more than beat the market. In fact, says Lydenberg, thinking in those terms is like &ldquo;burning your house to stay warm in the winter.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s urgently needed, observes Karp, is a new benchmark to replace the short-term timescale focus that has driven investment managers for so long. &ldquo;We need to act now and with fierce urgency,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The time has come to do capitalism right.&rdquo;     ",

    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> I talked to a CEO last week.  She had just hired us to handle her company&rsquo;s online marketing and needed to firm up some details.</p><p> While we were talking, we were on the topic of monthly reports. Her former marketing firm had emailed a report every month showing her keyword rankings. She was wondering exactly what she was going to receive from us.</p><p> She asked if we were going to send SEO ranking reports monthly. I replied, &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Turns out, that was the right answer for this CEO.  She responded, &ldquo;I never really saw that much value in them anyway.&rdquo;</p><p> Can you relate to this conversation?</p><p> I see too many search engine optimization companies and marketing firms trying to sell #1 rankings. Never mind that the keywords they mention seldom get searched, or that the words they try to sell you aren&rsquo;t the same words your ideal customers use, or that rankings are different for everyone.</p><p> Still, marketing firms sell rankings, and people fall for it. Let&rsquo;s take a look at why rankings really don&rsquo;t matter in modern SEO.</p><p> <strong>  You know what words your ideal customers use better than an SEO company. </strong></p><p> An SEO company can research keywords all day, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the words they uncover will be what your ideal customers search for. When an administrative assistant in need of a more secure company network searches the internet, she may not know to search the phrase &ldquo;managed IT services.&rdquo;</p><p> Because your salespeople talk to prospects and customers every day, they likely know the phrases customers use, because they want to use those same phrases and scenarios as they explain your product or solution.</p><p> <strong>  #1 rankings don&rsquo;t always lead to sales. </strong></p><p> As a CEO or VP of sales, you don&rsquo;t need #1 rankings, you need sales. Even though a high ranking makes it more likely that more people arrive at your website, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they will become leads.</p><li> What happens when someone visits your website?</li><li> What&rsquo;s your conversion rate?</li><li> What percentage of website visitors make contact?  <br/>  </li><p> These matter far more than your keyword ranking.</p><p> You see, if you want more sales opportunities from your website, there&rsquo;s a lot more to the equation than getting people to visit your website. You also have to find ways to convince those visitors that your product or solution might solve their problem, or at least that you understand their need.</p><p> I remember an artist who ranked #1 for &ldquo;free cartoons&rdquo; back in 2007, but hired us to figure out why he wasn&rsquo;t getting any sales on his website. The phrase &ldquo;free cartoons&rdquo; is searched 5,400 times per month in the United States according to Google&rsquo;s Keyword Planner, but the commercial intent of that phrase is virtually non-existent. Needless to say, optimizing his website for &ldquo;free cartoons&rdquo; probably wasn&rsquo;t his best decision if he wanted sales.</p><p> <strong>  Search engine rankings vary from person to person. </strong></p><p> Most executives don&rsquo;t know that search engine rankings vary from person to person. When I search Google for something, I may get completely different results than you do. Google looks at many factors when returning results, including: </p><li> Your web history (Google may show a result from a website you visited in the past)</li><li> Your geographical location (if you have a smartphone, especially an Android smartphone, Google knows where you&rsquo;ve been because of location services)</li><li> and a lot more  <br/>  </li><p> Knowing that your target customer may see different results is important.</p><p> <strong>  How should you measure SEO? </strong></p><p> The problem with the question, &ldquo;how should I measure SEO?&rdquo; is that SEO is simply a small portion of your online presence. No measurement is going to tell the whole story.</p><p> Instead, look at metrics that tell the story of your online marketing effectiveness, like: </p><li> Website visits (trends, measure month-to-month)</li><li> Website visits from search engines (also called &ldquo;organic traffic&rdquo;)</li><li> Number of times people read your blog posts each month</li><li> Number of web leads derived from search engines</li><li> Conversion rate from &ldquo;organic&rdquo; (search engine) traffic <br/>  </li><p> Don&rsquo;t be duped by SEO firms selling #1 rankings. Know that rankings don&rsquo;t necessarily lead to sales, and that your website rankings are likely to fluctuate from person to person.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.1.1426530835155&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1426518934825.1426530835155.13&amp;hsCtaTracking=d8d897ed-b3ae-49df-b281-96b13ac06e14%7C74b52b2f-8514-41b6-a7d2-717473fc05d0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/smart-marketing-template_2_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

When they hit tough times, they use mental toughness to keep moving forward because their heart and passion are hitched to a cause&mdash;failure or adversity is not enough to compel them to quit and move on and settle for something that provides less value and meaning in their life.</p><p> TIP: Ask yourself these two questions: &ldquo;What will make me happy?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What will make me successful?&rdquo; Do not mistakenly assume these two questions are one in the same.</p><p> <strong>  2. Examine Every Mistake For Lessons Learned </strong></p><p> Smart leaders know that mistakes teach you some of the most important lessons in life. </p><p> They understand that the only real mistake they can make in life is not learning from their misstep, or choosing to do nothing because they were too afraid of making another one. </p><p> TIP: Become a smart leader by taking chances&mdash;opportunities are where luck hides. It&rsquo;s not about something falling into your lap; it&rsquo;s about taking chances and finding your luck.</p><p> <strong>  3. Explore All Opportunities, Whether You Feel Prepared Or Not </strong></p><p> Smart leaders do not need to feel 100% ready when an opportunity arises.</p><p> They understand that all great opportunities will stretch them beyond their comfort zone. They will be stretched emotionally, intellectually, and philosophically. </p><p> TIP: Since luck hides in opportunities, move forward with mental toughness so you can manage your emotions, thoughts, and behavior in ways that will set you up for growth. These opportunities will continue to show up throughout your life, so make the most of them&mdash;even if you don&rsquo;t feel 100% ready!</p><p> <strong>  4. Focus On Priorities And Say &ldquo;NO&rdquo; To The Rest </strong></p><p> Smart leaders know how to say no, both to themselves and others.</p><p> They have learned that self-control helps them avoid impulsive decisions, stress, and burnout. Saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; is very different from saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can.&rdquo; Saying NO to things, people, and opportunities that are not a priority for them is a powerful way to exert self-control.</p><p> TIP: Saying NO is a way you can honor your goals and priorities so you can find the time to successfully achieve them.</p><p> <strong>  5. Pursue Peak Performance, Not Perfection </strong></p><p> Smart leaders focus on developing peak performance by continually moving into their discomfort zone.</p><p> They know that they will never reach their full potential if they become complacent and comfortable, so their grasp is always a bit beyond their reach.</p><p> TIP: Researchers agree that the gap between your skill level and your peak performance should hover around 4%. Anything more will discourage you from trying harder; anything less will not push you hard enough to move forward.</p><p> <strong>  6. Cultivate A Culture of Flexibility </strong></p><p> Smart leaders have an agile mind so they adapt to changes in their environment.</p><p> They know that fear of change is paralyzing and a major roadblock to their happiness. They learn how to embrace changes by continually placing themselves in situations where they are uncomfortable and change can be expected. And then, when they are confronted with the unknown in business and life, they are better able to predict their response. </p><p> TIP: Intentionally place yourself in situations where the outcome is not known. These situations will create new ways of thinking about obstacles and roadblocks that show up unexpectedly in your life. You will have the confidence to keep moving forward instead of reacting with fear and paralysis.</p><p> While success and happiness can be defined in many different ways, learn how to make these 6 habits your own. </p><p> What habits have helped make you successful?</p>",

    "content": "<p> As you&rsquo;re well aware, social media is nothing new and while I know many of you have a presence on at least one social network, it simply isn&rsquo;t enough to create value.</p><p> Typically what happens is many people create profiles and think they&rsquo;ve done enough. As an advisor, you must provide more by creating an online home where your community &ndash; your clients and prospects &ndash; can gather, engage with you, and find resources to help with their needs and challenges.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve had some advisors ask why they should even bother with social media because the information needed by their clients and prospects is already out there. This is a dangerous place to stay. <strong>  Your potential clients will gravitate to the advisor who is developing a relationship with them by providing resources they need and want. </strong></p><p> Here are 5 quick tips to create a solid foundation to your social media strategy:</p><p> <strong>  1. Determine Your Goals </strong></p><p> When it comes to social media, it&rsquo;s so easy to get pulled into the tactics by creating profiles and posting information with no formal strategy behind it. Answer the question, &ldquo;Why do you want to be on social media in the first place?&rdquo; When you determine why you want to be on social media, what you want to accomplish, and what your audience needs, you will be in a much stronger position with your social media efforts.</p><p> <strong>  2. Optimize Your Profiles with Keywords </strong></p><p> Start thinking about the words your prospects will use to find you in a Google search. They might try to search for you based on your title; Financial Advisor, Financial Planner, Wealth Advisor or by the services they need; retirement planning, tax planning, investing for women.  Choose the keywords that are applicable to you and your practice, and scatter them into your social profiles in a natural way.</p><p> <strong>  3. Know Your Target Market </strong></p><p> Segment your clients and prospects by determining their demographics, habits, challenges, and where they hang out on social media. A social mapping exercise will provide you with two key answers; the social media channels you need to engage on and the content you need to provide.</p><p> <strong>  4. Develop A Content Strategy </strong></p><p> Content is king! Social media requires great content and is the fuel for your social media engine. This step is going to require that you switch from a batch and blast marketing method to crafting intentional messages with purpose. Determine what you will share with whom before you decide how to share it.</p><p> <strong>  5. Test, Track, &amp; Measure </strong></p><p> Social media is always changing and to be successful you need to experiment and test. Play around with your posts by posting at different times of the day. Create different headlines for the same post and then watch to see which posts perform better. Review your activity based measurements which are your likes, shares, and followers along with your results based measurements, which are your conversions. You should always evaluate social media on its overall contribution to your business and marketing goals.</p><p> Download Ironstone&rsquo;s &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Media Implementation Guide.  </a> </u> &rdquo;</p><p>  The guide will provide you with the foundation to start your social strategy.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Many of my clients are successful professionals. They have good clients, make good money, and enjoy their jobs. The challenge is getting them to recognize that they could be even better at what they do.</p><p> Just because someone is successful doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything he or she does is effective (that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t bother to read articles by celebrities on diet and exercise, or how to make marriage last&hellip;!). Many of our management practices, to quote my friend and CEO coach Marshall Goldsmith, are &ldquo;superstitions.&rdquo; That is, even though they are second rate habits, over time we have associated them&mdash;erroneously&mdash;with positive outcomes. We write proposals or run first meetings with prospects a certain way, and we naturally associate those techniques with our success. But it&rsquo;s correlation not causation. That is: Many things we do work well, some things don&rsquo;t actually work that well, but we don&rsquo;t realize it because  overall  we are successful.</p><p> So how do you get highly successful people to recognize the need to change their average but ingrained behaviors that they believe have served them so well?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a simple idea: Use questions rather than trying to tell them what to do. The reason questions work well was identified by Ben Franklin 250 years ago. He said, &ldquo;Men are best convinced by ideas that they arrive at on their own.&rdquo; How true.</p><p> The right questions help engage and motivate the other person, and lead them to the right answer. Ideally, they will feel the idea was theirs, not yours.</p><p> Here are some suggestions for the types of questions that will help you change and improve others&rsquo; behaviors as a leader or coach:</p><h3> Ask self-assessment questions</h3><p> <br/> People love to self-assess, and it can help them recognize the need for change. For example:</p><li> &ldquo;In terms of achieving your objectives and advancing the sales process, how would you rate that meeting on a scale of 1-5, where 1=poor, 3=average, and 5=outstanding?&rdquo; and follow up with, &ldquo;Why did you give it that rating?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What would you change about it if you could do it over?&rdquo;</li><h3> Ask why questions: <br/>  </h3><li> &ldquo;Why do you think your client did that?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Why are we writing a proposal now?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Why is this important?&rdquo;</li><h3> Turn directives or statements into questions: <br/>  </h3><li> Instead of saying, &ldquo;You need to prepare more,&rdquo; ask &ldquo;How did feel about your preparation for that session?&rdquo; and &ldquo;In retrospect, is there anything you think you should have done differently, in terms of the way you prepared?&rdquo;</li><li> Instead of saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your team is collaborating very well on this account,&rdquo; simply ask &ldquo;How do you feel about the degree of collaboration within your team?&rdquo;</li><h3> Ask challenge questions: <br/>  </h3><li> &ldquo;Is this the best you can do?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do you feel this represented our best work/best effort?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Sounds like you wish that had gone better. Is there a better approach? Is anything holding you back from trying something different?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;I know the client doesn&rsquo;t want to consider this until the summer, but is there anything that would increase their sense of urgency? What could accelerate this?&rdquo;</li><p> When working with experienced managers, it&rsquo;s especially important to use questions to motivate and engage. You will most certainly provoke more positive change than if you simply tell people what they are doing wrong and how you want them to fix it.</p><p> Telling people what to do makes you look smart. Asking them thoughtful questions that help them discover the answer makes  them  look smart.</p>",

    "content": "<p> On average, we deal with over 100 email messages in our inbox every day. More and more, we rely on our emails to document and track communication between us and the people we work with and for. Knowing this, sometimes, we go too far or not far enough in choosing our words.</p><p> Here are the 5 phrases you&rsquo;re using that&rsquo;s hurting your reputation:</p><li> <strong>  &ldquo;As You Know&rdquo; </strong> <br/> If I know, it comes across snide and condescending. If I don&rsquo;t know, it comes across judgmental and rude. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Thanks, but&rdquo; </strong> <br/> This phrase is usually followed by something that negates any gratitude. If you really were thankful, it doesn&rsquo;t look like it. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;&hellip; and so on and so forth&rdquo; </strong> <br/> No one knows what this really means. It always comes across presumptive and dismissive. Arguably inarticulate and lazy. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;If you would be so kind as to&rdquo; </strong> <br/> This paints me into a no-win corner where either I have to do what, when and how you ask or be a jerkface. It&rsquo;s polite bullying. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t hear back from you, I will assume&rdquo;  </strong> <br/> This is demanding and slightly menacing. <br/>  </li><p> Everyone sets out to be seen as a supportive, helpful professional at work. At times, we fall short of this at times in moments of frustration, stress or weakness. No one is perfect; it is understandable.</p><p> This should be the exception in your communication, though, not the rule. If you&rsquo;re regularly using these kinds of phrases, it&rsquo;s time to make a change. Skip the passive-aggressive lead-ins and lead-ons &mdash; and just get to the point of what you want to say candidly, directly and tactfully. <br/>  </p><li> <strong>  Instead of saying &ldquo;As you know&rdquo;, try &ldquo;I am writing about the issue with X&rdquo; instead. </strong> This approach is direct and unassuming. If you&rsquo;re really not sure if the person knows about it, give a brief synopsis of the issue before moving into your questions or requests.</li><li> <strong>  Instead of &ldquo;Thanks, but&rdquo;, try &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; followed by a brand new sentence or paragraph about whatever additional thing is needed. </strong> This will not overshadow or erase your gratitude &hellip; Unless you&rsquo;re really not thankful. If you&rsquo;re not, don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; at all. No one like gratuitous gratitude.</li><li> <strong>  Instead of &ldquo;and so on and so forth&rdquo;, try a brief explanation of what the so on and so forth is. </strong>  Never assume the reader has all the same knowledge that you have. Use your message share information.</li><li> <strong>  Instead of &ldquo;if you would be so kind&rdquo;, just state what you need. </strong> And why.</li><li> <strong>  Instead of &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t hear from you, I will assume&rdquo;, just state the deadline for a response. </strong> And why. If the deadline is a short one, you may even want to pick up that old 19th century device called a telephone to let the person know that you sent an urgent email.</li><p> Because we send email to communicate, discuss, resolve and document the things that occur in our workplaces. If the communication isn&rsquo;t clear, it will lead to unnecessary complications and confusion &mdash; and, if it comes down to it, will not withstand legal scrutiny.</p><p> <strong>  Clear. Concise. Candid. Always in all ways. </strong></p><p> Are there more passive-aggressive email phrases you&rsquo;d like to see on this list? Tell me about it!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/author.html?author=12\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Helen Brown  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  In today's busy workplaces, finding time for employees to take part in traditional classroom training can be difficult and costly. </strong>  Training provided online can be a cost effective and flexible training solution. It allows employees to learn at their own pace wherever and whenever they want.</p><p> In a review of the workplace learning sector, the Annual Learning Survey 2014 report commissioned by  <u>  The Learning and Performance Institute </u>  (LPI) highlights how online learning is beginning to replace face to face training:</p><p> <strong>  \"One important long term trend is clear: the reduced role of the classroom.&rdquo; </strong>  Don Taylor, LPI Chairman</p><p> I spoke to two eLearning experts; Peter Gomms, Group Learning Technologies Manager at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.mottmac.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mott MacDonald  </a> </u>  and Guy McEvoy from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.guykat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   GuyKat  </a> </u> , who offer bespoke corporate eLearning and online training. </p><p> Mott McDonald have around 1500 employees learning online in 140 countries at any given time.  10 years ago they had just 6 courses, but now they have a catalogue of 800 with topics such as health and safety, induction, business skills and communication skills. Peter talked about how online training is particularly effective for Mott MacDonald as they have employees travelling and working around the world, often in remote locations.</p><p> For Mott MacDonald, online learning has replaced more costly methods of delivery and has been successfully adopted by employees across the business.  One example that Peter gave was the online induction course that replaced a book provided to each new employee.  For a company taking on around 500 new staff a year, the accumulative cost of the book was significant and there was no accurate way of measuring if employees were accessing the information fully.  Instead, employee progress could be tracked with the online course and short quizzes tested their knowledge on key points. The case for e-learning is clear, but what impact can video have?  </p><p> When I spoke to Guy McEvoy he was in Vegas for the  <u>  DevLearn </u>  conference, about to go in to a presentation about &lsquo;The Innovative Future of Video Learning&rsquo;.  He says that when used appropriately &ldquo;video is the way forward!&rdquo;.  Here are a few points we discussed: </p><p> <strong>  Bitesize content </strong>  </p><p> Guy said that &ldquo;increasingly, we&rsquo;re working with clients to build libraries of bite-size instruction that is specifically task-orientated.&rdquo;  Short, clear, well labelled video allows employees to access the knowledge when the need arises and dip in and out of learning.  Guy made the point that &ldquo;unless they&rsquo;re super diligent, learners won&rsquo;t really concentrate on the learning until they want or need to&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  Self-paced learning </strong></p><p> Learners can play, rewind or skip to the bits of video most relevant to them, allowing them to focus on areas they may be finding particularly difficult. This is especially valuable in &lsquo;how to&rsquo; videos where a complicated procedure is being demonstrated.</p><p> <strong>  Interactivity </strong></p><p> Guy was very enthusiastic about Branched Scenario Learning, the online learning equivalent to &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cyoa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Choose Your Own Adventure  </a> </u> &rsquo; books. Learners watch a video scenario, make a decision about where to go next and learn from the consequences.  Guy said that in his experience &ldquo;when learners are driving their own learning they find it far more engaging and memorable.&rdquo;</p><p> Online learning is here to stay. Well structured and high quality video is vital to engaging and retaining learners.  Using instructional video on an online learning platform can benefit a vast array of organisations. The accessibility and flexibility of learning resources is a catalyst for growth, no matter what industry you are in.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.sovereignman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Simon Black  </u> </a> <br/> Sovereign Valley Farm, Chile</p><p> Yesterday we discussed the utter insanity of the debt-based education system&mdash;the trillion+ dollar explosion of student loans out there that may very well be the next bubble to burst.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a completely ridiculous system which saddles 22-year olds with tens of thousands of dollars of debt before they even have a chance to start life.</p><p> But this has become the norm. DEBT has become the norm. Like everything else in our financial system, debt dominates.</p><p> Government finance. Consumer spending. Pension programs. Higher education.</p><p> All of these systems are based on debt.</p><p> And anyone who wants to break free from this needs to seek unconventional alternatives.</p><p> <strong>  So if you&rsquo;re a young person looking for other options other than debt-based university, consider the following: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1) Attend a foreign university. </strong>  If you absolutely MUST attend university at such a young age, consider top quality universities abroad.</p><p> Most importantly, you&rsquo;ll have the unforgettable experience of living abroad&hellip; something that can not only be life-changing, but also set you apart from your peers.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also a great way to learn a foreign language (even though the courses at many foreign universities may still be taught in English).</p><p> Plus, studying abroad can be a LOT cheaper.</p><p> L&rsquo;Ecole Polytechnique in France, for example, is consistently ranked as one of the top universities in the world. Yet first year tuition is less than $4,500, and they have a special program that&rsquo;s 100% English, including even the admissions process.</p><p> Even for advanced education, the English-language Masters programs at top-ranked EPFL in Switzerland can run as little as $1,350 each year, literally 95% less than in the US.</p><p> If you are American, this is a no-brainer while the dollar is strong. You can save tens of thousands of dollars on the cost of your education while still attending a tier-1 school.</p><p> <strong>  2) Travel. Get out and see the world. </strong> A budget as low as $5,000 can get you a round-the-world ticket and finance your living expenses for several months as you immerse yourself in rapidly growing economies.</p><p> (Note: travel &lsquo;hacks&rsquo; such as maximizing the use of free airline bonus miles are very useful in keeping to budget&hellip;)</p><p> You&rsquo;ll learn more about how the world works in four months on the road than in four years of university.</p><p> More importantly, you&rsquo;ll meet people and be exposed to countless opportunities that will prove invaluable when you&rsquo;re trying to decide what direction to take your life.</p><p> <strong>  3) Join a startup. </strong>   While traditional university education is a great way for young people to heavily indebt themselves before they even get started in life, joining a startup is the exact opposite&mdash;a potentially game-changing way for young people to build wealth.</p><p> Aside from the tremendous business experience and the life lessons in creating something from scratch, this route has the added benefit that eschewing college for a startup is socially palatable.</p><p> Naturally you&rsquo;ll need to go to a startup hive&mdash;places like San Francisco, Austin, Berlin, Bangkok, Santiago, etc.</p><p> While anyone can realistically do this, joining a startup is a great option for young people precisely because you&rsquo;re young.</p><p> You have no attachments. No family to support. No mortgage. Nothing to tie you down. And very little to lose.</p><p> <strong>  4) Find a mentor. </strong>  This used to be the way people learned their craft&mdash;by studying under someone who was doing it.</p><p> Seek out someone you admire who has all the success traits that you desire and make yourself indispensible to that person.</p><p> Offer to be an unpaid intern&mdash;use a small fraction of what you would have paid for a university education to finance your living costs. Then learn as many valuable skills as you can directly from someone who has mastered them.</p><p> <strong>  5) Above all else, learn. </strong>  Even if you can&rsquo;t go abroad, or you don&rsquo;t have enough scratch saved up for any of the above options, spend at least an hour a day improving your financial education, learning a language, or developing other marketable skills.</p><p> <strong>  6) And yes, apply for our summer entrepreneurship camp. </strong></p><p> Every summer I bring in some of the most successful entrepreneurs I know to teach young people exactly how to build a business and create value in the world.</p><p> But probably the biggest benefit is the alumni network that the students join&mdash;young, like-minded movers and shakers from around the world.</p><p> Our entrepreneurship camp is free&mdash;I finance it myself. And our goal for the past six years has been to essentially combine each of the options I outlined above. Education. Travel. Entrepreneurship. Mentorship. Etc.</p><p> Attending our camp is highly competitive. We receive applications from all over (this year we already have applications from places like Burkina Faso, Philippines, Moldova, Algeria, Kazakhstan, China, etc.), and we have limited space available.</p><p> But if you&rsquo;re interested in what could potentially be a life-changing experience, take a look at our website:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sovereignacademy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.sovereignacademy.org  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Even though social media, video and other areas of digital marketing get so much attention these days, we still believe that whitepapers play an important role in your marketing strategy. Here are five best practices to help you get these valuable pieces done right.</p><p> <strong>  Set the right tone </strong></p><p> Your whitepapers should be written in conversational tone &hellip; and in the third person.</p><p> There are fewer and fewer situations that require a very formal tone. As our conversations get more casual, our writing follows. Exercising restraint is important, as whitepapers are fairly &ldquo;academic,&rdquo; and are often read by people who are well-versed in the topic.</p><p> <strong>  Solve the right problem </strong></p><p> Writing a whitepaper may be one of the most challenging marketing exercises, so make sure the problem you are solving is one that your audience truly wants solved.</p><p> To make sure your topic engages your readers, do a little research into their needs. Survey your sales team, research online and, if you have the relationships and resources, talk to your clients directly.</p><p> <strong>  Use third-party facts </strong></p><p> Back up your points and arguments with some facts &ndash; and make sure these facts aren&rsquo;t all from your in-house team.</p><p> This is where we come across one of the most significant limitations of whitepapers: they tend to take more time to produce than other materials. If possible, you should include some independent research to support your findings. This will enhance the credibility of your work.</p><p> <strong>  Let your designers run wild </strong></p><p> Whitepaper doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;blankpaper&rdquo; or &ldquo;boringpaper.&rdquo; Luckily for you, not everyone knows this, so design is a way to stand out from the crowd.</p><p> Make your whitepaper look professional and easy to read, use a larger font, don&rsquo;t crowd the copy, and experiment with design elements and themes that break up the whitespace.</p><p> <strong>  Incorporate graphs, charts and infographics </strong></p><p> Amid your facts and findings, well-crafted visual aids will help keep your reader&rsquo;s attention.</p><p> Every data point can be backed up with an engaging chart or graph. We think whitepapers are begging for infographics. Since you&rsquo;ll have so much data to work with, it should be fairly simple to create some easy-to-read infographics that will surely engage your audience.</p><p> So, as you develop your social platforms and other digital marketing endeavours, don&rsquo;t forget about whitepapers and the unique value they add to a robust marketing strategy.</p>",

    "title": "Where is the Uber of Banking?",
    "link": "where-is-the-uber-of-banking",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The smartphone revolution has radically restructured every industry from booking a trip (TripAdvisor), a room (Airbnb) or a taxi (Uber), but where&rsquo;s the Uber of banking? There isn&rsquo;t one yet and consumers will soon defect to new players unless high street banks wake up, says Chris Skinner, chairman of the Financial Services Club</p><p> <strong>  Technology is changing every aspect of our daily lives and its march is getting louder, faster and stronger as each day goes by. You only have to look at the total immersion of people in their smartphone screens on the train or street to see the impact of consumer technologies. </strong> The imminent arrival of wearables, such as Apple iWatch and the Volvo helmet  to keep cyclists safe, will have even more impact this year.</p><p> However, it is not these technologies themselves that make them so immersive and persuasive, but the apps that run on them. If you have not used Uber yet, it is the usual app focused upon by innovators as the gold standard of disruptive innovation. The reason it is cited so often is because it has emerged from nowhere as the app everyone loves. This app finds your nearest taxi, tells them you need picking up and where you want to go, and pays them, all within the app. That takes away two big barriers to people with a busy city life: finding a taxi and paying them. The app does it all. It takes away the friction.</p><p> That is what disruptive innovators have achieved in travel and related markets, but what is happening in banking? Not a lot. Most large banks have just taken their internet services to a mobile screen or, as I like to think of it, they&rsquo;ve taken a big-screen banking system and converted it to a small screen. That is not particularly innovative thinking. For example, when the French insurance group AXA launched their mobile banking app, they invested in specifically making it a mobile-app-oriented experience. Similarly, new startups overseas, such as Moven in American, are creating new bank services with easy sign-on, touch-screen navigation, integration with other mobile apps and using fingerprints for authentication.</p><p> <strong>  SMELL THE COFFEE </strong></p><p> These are things we are not seeing from most mainstream banks, as most mainstream banks have to evolve their old systems to keep up with these innovations, rather than innovating themselves. In fact, it may surprise you to find that the most innovative financial app out there comes from Starbucks, the coffee company. Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, speaking about mobile payments during the company&rsquo;s January 22 investors&rsquo; update, said: &ldquo;Today, in the US alone, over 13 million customers were actively using our mobile apps and we are now averaging more than seven million mobile transactions in our stores each week, representing 16 per cent of total tender. That&rsquo;s more than any other bricks-and-mortar retailer in the marketplace.&rdquo;</p><p> And it&rsquo;s also more than most banks, although in Britain we have seen a strong take-up of mobile banking apps. According to the It&rsquo;s In Your Hands report, released last summer by the banking industry&rsquo;s representative body, the British Bankers&rsquo; Association, we are downloading more than 15,000 banking apps a day and making almost &pound;1 billion in payments per day via mobile and internet.</p><p> That is all well and good, but do you see your bank as an innovator?  Are their apps as cool as Songkick or as informative as Flipboard? Have you found the Uber of banking: the one that removes all the friction from dealing with your money and makes it easy and fun to keep up with your spending? I&rsquo;m guessing the answer is probably not, but two startups will address this challenge during 2015.</p><p> The first is founded by a team that comprises the former chief executive of First Direct and the co-founder of Metro Bank. It&rsquo;s called Atom Bank, based in Durham, and launching as a pure-play digital bank. What this means is that the bank is geared for mobile-first access. There is no call centre, apart from one for technical support, as you should not need to call a call centre for financial queries. Those are all answered by the app.</p><p> The other is Starling Bank that describes itself as the &ldquo;Facebook for finance&rdquo;. Embedding its service in a cool structure that is social as well as financial, Starling expects to be one of the killer players in UK banking this year.</p><p> A third player that already exists is Fidor Bank which has been operating since 2009 in Germany and plans to open its UK service in 2015 too. What is interesting about this bank &ndash; and you should note that all three of these new startups will be proper banks with proper bank licences &ndash; is it specifically wants to appeal to the post-2008 disaffected customer. It will bank money, commodities, investments, and even bitcoins and World of Warcraft Gold. This bank is different and very social.</p><p> <strong>  SOCIAL MEDIA </strong></p><p> They are proper banks that are community focused first. Their community is primarily in the social media world of Facebook and they become relevant to that community by firstly offering preferential interest rates based upon the number of Facebook likes they receive.</p><p> By way of example, last year they ran a promotion where the bank would lower interest rates on loans by 0.1 per cent and increase interest on savings by 0.1 per cent based upon gaining an extra 2,000 likes.</p><p> Why would Fidor do this? Because it builds community. They get 2,000 Facebook likes and that translates to 670,000 friends and family influencing the Facebook community to also like Fidor. That is because, according to Pew Research, the average Facebook user has 338 friends. So every like gets 338 people influenced to be aware of and engage with Fidor, and those influencers are friends and family.</p><p> The result is that Fidor is being exposed to thousands of people every day, and what they hear and see is that Fidor is a cool bank, engaged with their community in a social conversation about money and finance. It is the reason why Fidor spends just $20 to gain a fully KYC (know your client) on-boarded customer, compared with $1,500 for the average traditional bank.</p><p> In other words, traditional banks spend a fortune pushing products through channels by shouting at clients in the media; new banks spend a minimal amount talking to people about money through their communities of interest.</p><p> This is the key to the Uber of banking. The Uber of banking will be social, cool, transparent, trustworthy, simple, secure and reliable. There are some new ones out there today that are specifically trying to embrace these values and, if your bank is not one of them, but you want to be with one of them, then you may wish to consider taking a look at the launch plans of others soon in 2015.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stuart_Friedman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Stuart Friedman  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  All people&ndash;fortunately or unfortunately&ndash;are dispensable. </strong> One person cannot control another person and, should they quit tomorrow, there is little a boss can do beyond having a contingency plan in place. <strong>  Good leaders need to shift their paradigm to accepting circumstances may never change and always have a Plan B. </strong></p><p> An illustration:</p><p> On a Thursday, approximately five minutes before 2 p.m., the VP of Operations went into a meeting where people were already waiting. In observing the VP&rsquo;s appearance, one person asked if he was feeling okay; he was pale and had beads of sweat on his forehead. He replied that he was sluggish but okay. By the end of the meeting, more people inquired about his health as he seemed to worsen. The VP admitted to not feeling well.</p><p> The company president suggested the VP go to the hospital. He refused, saying that if he didn&rsquo;t feel better the next morning, he would have his wife take him.</p><p> The company was experiencing its greatest growth in 12 years. The VP was a 30-year employee in this privately-held, family-owned business. He had much of the know-how of running the operations: purchasing/procurement, manufacturing, finishing, shipping/receiving, etc. His brain was like a database of information especially with historical methods of solving complex problems that occur once every five or six years.</p><p> He was great as a go-to person. He created a sub-culture whereby people go to him for help and he fixes the problem. He responds with, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo; The result is that no one other than this VP can solve some&ndash;if not most&ndash;of the complex problems.</p><p> While the VP has great qualities, over the years, he has not been a good mentor, teacher or supervisor. The company president came in only two years ago and, during his short tenure, has tried to get the VP to document/memorialize much of what he does day to day. The VP, as busy as he has been, procrastinated on this request.</p><p> The company president relies on him so much that he has a plan to reorganize the operations division and place this VP on his own to execute special projects. The company is growing and a couple manager-level individualsfor operations were hired to take on responsibilities. The president asked the VP for assistance to create a plan for these managers. He didn&rsquo;t. Perhaps it was because he perceived a threat that he was being replaced before he was ready.</p><p> In my opinion, the VP positioned himself well to be &ldquo;counted on&rdquo; by the president as well as all the employees involved with operations. He made himself indispensable and created job security until he decides to retire. Shame on the organization for not seeing this and, because they didn&rsquo;t see it, they never set up a contingency plan. That problem was more glaring when, on Friday the next morning, the VP&rsquo;s wife couldn&rsquo;t wake him because he lay there dead in his bed from a heart attack during the night.</p><p> <strong>  Do any of the following sentiments apply to your organization: </strong></p><li> Do you have employees that refuse to share pertinent information with others?</li><li> Do you feel you have employees that hoard information and use only to their personal advancement?</li><li> Do you feel you have employees that are holding you hostage because of what they know or what they can do?</li><li> Do you feel stress every time you think of these team members or having to work with them? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Every good leader should have a Plan B for the organization. Consider: </strong></p><li> Ask them to create documentation: <li>  Be specific as to what you want them to document and timing for completion. </li> <li>  Have the individuals that would be using this information review for completeness, correctness and clear understanding. </li></li><li> Have the individual(s) create a training program with timelines to get this information into the minds of the appropriate employees, team members, colleagues, peers, etc.</li><li> Create an incentive and consequence. <br/>  </li><p> If you do not get response from your reports, cease hoping that one day these people in your organization will come around and your company will be okay for the future. They will not and it will not. <strong>  You are the leader and you need to be prepared for every circumstance. </strong></p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

    "link": "whats-the-meaning-of-all-of-this-employee-lingo",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Confused by some of the employee experience lingo you're hearing? You're not alone! </strong> <br/> <br/> A couple weeks ago, I participated in a  <u>  webinar </u>  with Kyle Antcliff of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.intradiem.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Intradiem  </a> </u> . We talked about the employee experience, employee journey mapping, and solutions that drive or impact workforce efficiency. <br/> <br/> During the presentation, a lot of employee experience terms were used, and I attempted to clarify with some definitions. I thought those definitions were worthy of sharing. <br/> <br/> Let's start with  <strong>  Employee Experience </strong> . I define it as:</p><p> The sum of all interactions that an employee has with his employer during the duration of his employment relationship. It includes any way the employee \"touches\" the company and vice versa in the course of doing his job.</p><p> It needs to be understood (using tools like personas, journey mapping, and surveys and other listening posts). And it can be designed/redesigned. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Employee Engagement </strong>  is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot, so it's important to understand what engagement means and how it comes about. This definition of engaged employees comes from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/166667/five-ways-improve-employee-engagement.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a> </u> .</p><p> Engaged workers stand apart from their not-engaged and actively disengaged counterparts because of the discretionary effort they consistently bring to their roles. These employees willingly go the extra mile, work with passion, and feel a profound connection to their company. They are the people who will drive innovation and move your business forward. </p><p> Engagement cannot be forced upon employees or mandated, dictated, or declared. No one can make an employee engaged. It comes from within, and yet the company has a role in it, as well. When  there's some confluence of: (1) emotions, commitment, passion, sense of ownership, etc. on the part of the employee about the brand and (2) what the organization does (purpose, brand promise, who the company is and why, etc.) to facilitate and enhance those emotions or that commitment - then we have employee engagement. <br/> <br/> &hellip;you have to want to be engaged. There has to be deep-seated desire in your heart and mind to participate, to be involved, and to make a difference. If the desire isn&rsquo;t there, no person or book can plant it within you. -Tim Clark <br/> <br/> What, then, is  <strong>  Employee Satisfaction </strong> ? Is it the same thing? It is not. Sorry for the circular argument, but...</p><p> Employee Satisfaction refers to how satisfied employees are; it doesn&rsquo;t address or include motivations or emotional commitment. </p><p> To further clarify: some employees are satisfied because they get paid every two weeks, because the employer provides childcare, or simply because they have a job. That doesn&rsquo;t really tell us much, unless we know what drives it. That puts the measure into context, but it's not the ultimate goal - for employees or for the business. <br/> <br/> How is  <strong>  Employee Happiness </strong>  related? There are a lot of definitions of Employee Happiness out there, but  <u>  <a href=\"/category/workforce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this one  </a> </u>  struck a chord with me:</p><p> Happiness at work is a function of engagement, morale, and satisfaction.</p><p> That almost makes it sound like an \"umbrella metric.\" Does that mean it's a good measure of the overall employee experience? Or is it a chicken and egg story? Does happiness come before (drive) or after engagement, morale, and satisfaction? <br/> <br/> What is  <strong>  Employee Morale </strong> ? According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_morale\" target=\"_blank\">   Wikipedia  </a> </u> , it is...</p><p> Employee morale, in human resources, is defined as the job satisfaction, outlook, and feelings of well-being an employee has within a workplace setting. Proven to have a direct effect on productivity, it is one of the cornerstones of business.</p><p> And finally, how does Employee Experience differ from  <strong>  Culture </strong> ? People often confuse the two. What is Culture? Herb Kelleher, former CEO of Southwest Airlines, defined it as...</p><p> ...what employees do when no one is looking. </p><p> I love that.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/05/heres-what-trumps-strategy-and-culture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I think  </a> </u>  it's... </p><p> ...the set of values and norms that guides how the business operates. Culture happens when we operationalize the values. </p><p> I also agree with these six components of culture, as outlined in an  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/05/six-components-of-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HBR article  </a> </u> : vision, values, practices, people, narrative, and place. <br/> <br/> You may have other definitions or thoughts on the differences in these terms. I'd love to hear them! <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s sad, really, how a negative workplace can impact our lives and the way we feel about ourselves. The situation is reaching pandemic heights &ndash; most people go to work at jobs they dislike, supervised by people who don&rsquo;t care about them, and directed by senior leaders who are often clueless about where to take the company.&rdquo;  - Leigh Branham and Mark Hirschfeld, Re-Engage: How America&rsquo;s Best Places to Work Inspire Extra Effort in Extraordinary Time.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In my blog &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.futuristmm.com/?p=8013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital Technology &ndash; What Now  </a> </u> ?&rsquo; I spoke about the plethora of technological discoveries and advancements we are making on a daily rate across the globe. The futuristas, the technological innovators, the neuroscientists, the strategists, the lateral thinkers creating systems far beyond anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p><p> First, we had the radio, the telephone, the television, the DVD player, the CD player, etc; all of these appliances being &lsquo;one way&rsquo; appliances (arguably, with the exception of the telephone). We are now beginning to look at technology in much more psychological and scientific ways. Now, like never before, we are looking deeply into our neurological self and applying this to economics, marketing and smart devices. We&rsquo;re not just looking at technology as one way road, we&rsquo;re looking at how we, as human beings, can interact and work with it by truly understanding how we work neurologically. We are beginning to look at ourselves more humanistically, i.e. as individuals and not just as a particular gender, age or race. So taking this all into consideration we are now looking at technology in a very different way.</p><p> The Hoover Dam of technology I referred to in this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.futuristmm.com/?p=8013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog  </a> </u>  is finally beginning to show cracks. There&rsquo;s trickles forming down the brick face. Cracks are appearing across the whole dam. As the build up increases soon the dam will break and there will be the most monumental, life changing tsumani of smart systems changing the face of modern life.</p><p> A great example of this is the  <a href=\"http://www.futuristmm.com/iot/internet-of-things/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I  <u>   nternet of Things  </u> </a> .</p><p> &lsquo;The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or &ldquo;things&rdquo; embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure&rsquo;</p><p> We still have a long way to go before the Internet of Things is fully integrated into our daily lives but, I for one, can&rsquo;t wait.</p><p> In this video Dr. John Barratt talks about the impending arrival of the Internet of Things and the importance of human wisdom and compassion to ensure control of this technology that will ultimately change our lives. I agree strongly that think this is key.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QaTIt1C5R-M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-11.26.56-AM.png\" width=\"1091\"/> </a></p><p> Dr. John Barrett is Head of Academic Studies at the Nimbus Centre for Embedded Systems Research at Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) and Group Director of the Centre&rsquo;s Smart Systems Integration Research Group. His research is focused on packaging, miniaturisation and embedding of smart systems in materials, objects and structures.</p><p> In my blog &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.futuristmm.com/?p=8400\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Are We Losing Our Ability to Be Human?&rsquo;  </a> </u>  I talk about the gradual diminishment of our ability to be human. Technology is, arguably creating dehumanization. Whilst we dive headlong into the fray of &lsquo;what will be&rsquo;, we must be mindful of retaining our humanism. We must ensure we utilise the Internet of Things for the betterment of mankind, because, as Barratt says, the opportunities to use this technology for negative purposes is a very real concern. We are already reading about terrorists utilizing smart devices to glean information and knowledge.</p><p> We are about to release a beast, a gigantic technological beast that will encompass us all. The secret to ensuring the beast is properly trained to help us as a race will be solely down to wise and considered human interaction. We cannot relinquish control to artificial intelligences and at the same time expect to retain it. We must create a balance of human input and artificial intelligence.</p><p> In my blog &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.futuristmm.com/?p=8041\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Are We Virtually There  </a> </u> &rsquo; I refer to the movie &lsquo;Her&rsquo; where &lsquo;Samantha&rsquo; played by Scarlett Johannson eventually becomes an independent intelligence making her own decisions and interacting freely and by her own means with other artificial intelligences. There are hundreds of sci fi and dystopian novels that talk about the over powering of the human race by robots and AI&rsquo;s.</p><p> Could this happen? If, sorry,  when , the Internet of Things happens everything will be linked, if we think we&rsquo;re plugged in now, then we&rsquo;d better think again. There&rsquo;s no denying we&rsquo;re heading for a technocratic world. Technocracy, as Barratt says in the video is already well and truly here. We are only a mere twenty years since the birth of the internet and look at what we&rsquo;ve achieved already. We&rsquo;ve really only just touched the surface ..</p><p> Buckle up, we&rsquo;re in for a big ride..</p>",

In fact, according to a study completed by Cerulli Associates, nearly one third of advisors plan to retire within the next decade and an estimated 200,000 advisors could retire by 2022.</p><p> At the crux of the issue is the question: who will inherit, purchase or manage the business when this retirement wave happens?</p><p> <strong>  The industry better get busy engaging, training and empowering professionals that graduated college within the last dozen years or get comfortable with the idea that technology will replace more people than the current advisor population might like to admit. </strong></p><p> With aging advisors managing the majority of the sector&rsquo;s wealth, and advisors over the age of 60 controlling  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/your-money/financial-planners/when-your-financial-adviser-retires.html?_r=2\" target=\"_blank\">   $2.3 trillion  </a> </u>  of this wealth, serious concerns have been raised as to how industry veterans plan on transferring their books of business to future generations. The issue, however, is that future generations are not pursuing financial advisory careers.</p><p> <strong>  According to Lisa Kidd Hunt, executive vice president at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., &ldquo;Less than 7% of college graduates coming out today are looking to pursue a career in financial services.&rdquo; </strong> Moreover, for every eight advisors that retire, only three are trained to replace them. With no one on the other end of their succession plans, seasoned advisors cannot ensure the continuity of their businesses. There is a reason why some advisors say they&rsquo;ll never retire&hellip;they can&rsquo;t!</p><p> In addition to the aging advisor population and talent shortages, the financial services industry must contend with yet another issue: new customers. According to a study produced by the Boston College Center on Wealth &amp; Philanthropy, it is estimated that by 2061, $36 trillion of wealth will be passed down to future generations.</p><p> While the industry braces for this intergenerational shift in wealth, it must first understand its new consumer &ndash; the millennial. Representing  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2014/03/07/financial-advisers-do-you-have-a-strategy-to-attract-millennials/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   24 percent of the population  </a> </u> , millennials fall a bit far from the proverbial apple tree when it comes to their finances. Unlike the generations before them, millennials have adopted an independent view on investing, with 72 percent of them describing themselves as &ldquo;self-directed.&rdquo; Moreover, not only are these budding investors autonomous, they seem to have placed little trust in the industry. According to a report produced by Merrill Lynch, only 19 percent of millennials believe financial advisors act in their best interest.</p><p> <strong>  Another important topic to note as it relates to millennials is how exactly they consume information, especially with regards to technology. </strong> Unlike their predecessors, younger millennials are less likely to have contact with their financial advisors and instead prefer to access financial services online.  <br/> <br/> From  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.wealthfront.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   WealthFront  </a> </u>  to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mint.com  </a> </u>  to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.esurance.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eSurance  </a> </u> , there are a host of financial information and money management services that have already captured the business of those in their twenties and thirties making their big financial decisions for the first time.</p><p> These websites raise an additional challenge for financial advisors in that the majority of them come at a cost that is a fraction of what traditional brick-and-mortar advice firms might charge.</p><p> Addressing millennials and their habits is a serious concern for financial advisors and at  <u>  77 million </u>  strong, not addressing this segment could present serious business risk.</p><p> <strong>  Given the changes in the financial services landscape &ndash; graying advisors, talent shortages and new customers &ndash; advisors need to devise a plan to adapt. </strong> They need to rebrand their industry, refine and modernize their messaging, and ultimately, engage with the investing generations of the future.</p><p> Financial services firms are not sitting idly staring at this issue. There is plenty of evidence that engaging younger prospective clients and employees is a core focus for many. For some, the solution is to tout a new app or online tool. For others, finding a way to use SnapChat or Instagram to showcase the firm&rsquo;s hip culture with recruits might be a tactic. Some have gone so far as to enable 30-year-old executives to lead recruitment or serve as lead spokespeople for their firms to put an age appropriate face on the firm.</p>",

    "title": "Should We Be Coaching or Managing Performance?",
    "link": "should-we-be-coaching-or-managing-performance",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Between employees who cannot cite any value in the performance evaluation process to practitioners who treat it as one more administrative task; performance management has taken a beating over the years. I always say the employee-employer dynamic is very much like a relationship- you should never go to bed mad and communication is key. In over ten years of working I have been reviewed five times. Each time, I found the process to be long, difficult and chock full of obligatory awkward conversations. This is coming from someone in HR, go figure! <strong>  Which raises the question, if both the employer and employee are dissatisfied with this process, why not change it? </strong></p><p> To start, the name &ldquo;performance management&rdquo; insinuates that leaders actually have control over performance. I would wager that this notion of managing performance is outdated and far from reality. Performance is owned and managed by none other than the employee. It is the employee who is responsible for knowing what is expected of them and decides how they will execute. Yes, management along with other external factors can have either a positive or negative effect on performance. However, the heavy-lifting is left to the devices of the employee. Try as any manager may, the best you can do is provide an ecosystem of success where resources and support are adequate; while coaching your employees along the way. By no stretch of the imagination can you coerce your employees to perform any better than their abilities and efforts will allow.</p><p> <strong>  Isn&rsquo;t performance coaching a better approach? </strong></p><p> I think so. It takes the drudgery out of managing a process that neither party is gleaning value from. Performance coaching takes the process from &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just get this over with&rdquo; to &rdquo; how can I help you be successful&rdquo;. Career progression and upward mobility in organizations are seldom possible without someone at the leadership level advocating for you. Performance coaching is a perfect way to shift the trajectory of the common performance conversation to a mutual dialogue where each person feels comfortable discussing their expectations, needs and solutions to moving beyond any performance barriers.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s some reasons why you may want a performance coach vs. someone who manages performance: </strong></p><p> 1) Good coaches will cheer you on and will be your biggest critic when you fail to execute.</p><p> 2) You are empowered to take control of your development; they are merely there to facilitate your goals.</p><p> 3) You become more than an evaluation or calibration form. Your coach can now connect with the human and hopefully better understand your motivations and career goals.</p><p> 4) As your accountability partner, your coach will be responsible for holding you accountable for meeting goals and company expectations.</p><p> 5) Lastly, it could be a safe haven where failure, mistakes and performance deficits become action plans for continuous improvement- rather than fodder for a static metric.</p><p> <strong>  I say ditch the performance evaluation forms, calibration meetings and all the other nonsense that goes along with performance management. </strong> Instead, incorporate regular, open and honest discussion and collaboration to improve people at whatever level they are at. It may sound crazy, but maybe we need to get back to assuming that our employees are doing the best they can everyday. On that premise alone, this concept of performance coaching is worth a shot.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This weekend we had beautiful weather and my son was eager to go outside and kick his soccer ball around.  Instead of going to the park, he ventured onto our tiny patch of green in the back of our house and within a few minutes had kicked the ball over the neighbor&rsquo;s fence. What happened next was eye opening. </p><p> My son knocked on the neighbor&rsquo;s door to get back his ball, but they weren&rsquo;t home. Finally, about an hour later, they pulled into their driveway, and he zipped to their door to ask for his ball.  </p><p> He was told:</p><p> &ldquo;I threw it back over the fence.&rdquo;</p><p> Simple!  Great!  Thank you! </p><p> My son ran into our yard and that&rsquo;s when I heard his wail.  He walked inside to show me his deflated ball with hundreds of tooth marks. It was clearly not salvageable. Their dog had chowed on his ball to the point where it resembled a new fangled frisbee more than a soccer ball.  </p><p> It wasn&rsquo;t only the fact that his ball was now trash that was upsetting, but also the reply to the request to get back his ball.  Yes, it was now back in our yard, but it was not exactly a ball anymore. Did not sit well with me. </p><p> So, did the neighbor lie when he said he threw it back into our yard?  No, he did chuck it over the fence.  Did he tell the whole truth?  I&rsquo;m going with no on that too. <strong>  Partial truths and whole lies may look similar, but they&rsquo;re not.  </strong></p><p> <strong>  What do you think?  Partial Truths, Whole Lies, or Something Else? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Scenario #1: Yesterday you gave your boss a key document to review. </strong></p><p> <strong>  You: </strong>  Did you get a chance to review my document?</p><p> <strong>  Boss: </strong>  I did.  Good work.  I just left it on your chair.  </p><p> When you get back to your desk, you discover a document with so many red marks that you have to turn it sideways to read all of the comments and suggested changes.  By the time you get done with revisions, it will not remotely resemble your initial draft. </p><p> <strong>  Scenario #2: You are unable to attend a client meeting with your team.   </strong></p><p> <strong>  You: </strong> How did the meeting go?</p><p> <strong>  Colleague: </strong> Great. They&rsquo;re happy. </p><p> Turns out when they client expressed some concerns about your portion of the project, your colleague threw you under the bus.  They commiserated with the client on your oh-so-shortsighted approach and vowed to keep an eye on you. That made the client happy. </p><p> <strong>  Scenario #3: You asked your friend to go to a concert on Saturday night. </strong></p><p> <strong>  You: </strong> Wow! Justin Bieber concert this Saturday! We&rsquo;ve got to get tickets!</p><p> <strong>  Friend: </strong> I can&rsquo;t. My grandmother&rsquo;s in town.  I&rsquo;m totally bummed. </p><p> Your friend&rsquo;s grandmother is in town but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from going to see Bieber do his thing with three of your other friends.  They didn&rsquo;t include you in the original plans.  </p><p> <strong>  Scenario #4: You demand that your child cleans their room.  </strong></p><p> <strong>  You: </strong> Clean your room, or you lose your iPad for three weeks! Do it!</p><p> <strong>  Child: </strong> All done! Look &ndash; not a thing&rsquo;s on the floor. </p><p> Your child is praying you don&rsquo;t open their closet or lift their beanbag where  months worth of stinky socks, toys and would-be trash are hiding.  At least it&rsquo;s true, the floor is finally clear and there is a path from the door to the bed. </p><p> <strong>  Scenario #5: There are tons of rumors about layoffs. You ask for the truth. </strong></p><p> <strong>  You: </strong> I hear that layoffs are coming.  Can you tell me the scoop?</p><p> <strong>  Boss: </strong> Where did you hear that? I&rsquo;d love to know. </p><p> Deflecting and redirecting the conversation your boss hopes that you don&rsquo;t realize that they did not give you a straight answer. You&rsquo;re not shocked when two weeks later half of your team gets their pink slips. You are disappointed in your boss and their lack of transparency. They had to know it was coming.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the key difference between partial truths and a whole lies? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Intention. </strong>  </p><p> Who does your response most serve?  You?  </p><p> In every scenario above, it was easier to tell a partial truth than a painful truth.  Self-protection and avoidance of tough conversations are common but are also not leadership.  <strong>  There are times when leaders have to step into what&rsquo;s uncomfortable and leave easy behind.  </strong></p><p> Partial truths (aka lies) are told as a CYA.  (unless of course it&rsquo;s defending the existence of Santa Claus) </p><u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The+truth+doesn%E2%80%99t+need+spin%2C+it+needs+compassion+and+courage.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/partial-truths-whole-lies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The truth doesn&rsquo;t need spin, it needs compassion and courage. </a></u> <strong> What if the neighbor had responded:</strong><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Our dog got to your ball. I had to throw it away.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  What if your boss said: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed by all of the red marks. We can discuss it. They&rsquo;re suggestions and ideas in addition to a few changes.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  What if your colleague said: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I know that (your name here) is working hard on a solution.  I&rsquo;ll have them reach out to you. They regret that they could not be here.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  What if your friend said: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you wanted to go. I already have tickets. I wish I had asked you.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  What if your child said: </strong></p><p> I cleaned up my desk and picked up my dirty clothes. I didn&rsquo;t realize it would take so much effort to get organized. I&rsquo;ll do more tomorrow too.</p><p> <strong>  What if your boss said: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not able to disclose the details because I&rsquo;m still getting information about the changes. I don&rsquo;t want to give you bad information.&rdquo;</p><u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=In+the+absence+of+facts%2C+we+make+up+stories+and+most+of+them+are+not+fairytales+with+happy+endings&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/partial-truths-whole-lies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  In the absence of facts, we make up stories and most of them are not fairytales with happy endings </a></u><p> As for my son, we bought him a new ball.  He loves it and has learned that there are consequences you can&rsquo;t always predict. Also, he learned why it&rsquo;s better to tell an uncomfortable truth than a partial one. </p><p> <strong>  BREAK THE FRAME ACTION: </strong></p><p> Step into your discomfort.</p><p> Lead with integrity to build trust.</p><p> Be a role model for respect, courage and compassion.</p><p> You always have a choice&hellip; tell the truth.</p><p> <strong>  How will you stop telling partial truths in favor of speaking the whole truth?

    "content": "<p> What comes first the business or the brand? Do you develop your business with branding in mind or focus on building your brand after?</p><p> With the economy resurging and more businesses starting to flourish, customers&rsquo; have more options. The competition is fierce and businesses that build a more valuable brand are winning.</p><p> Amazon&rsquo;s CEO,  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos\" target=\"_blank\">   Jeff Bezos  </a> </u>  says that:</p><p> Your brand is what other people say about you when you&rsquo;re not in the room. </p><p> A brand is the promise, the big idea, the expectations that reside in each customer&rsquo;s mind about a product, service or company.</p><p> Good branding is being a category leader for your product or service. Great branding is about adding value to the lives of consumers.</p><p> Here are 5 ways to build a more valuable brand for your business&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  5. Be More Convenient </strong></p><p> Convenience is critical to your sales and very important to your brand. Limiting the barriers your customers encounter before purchasing will ultimately increase sales and decrease purchase abandonment.</p><p> So, building a more valuable brand means increasing the distribution or presence of your brand.</p><p> For instance, having physical retail locations, website, mobile app, and independent representatives to service your clients helps your brand be more convenient.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/progressive.png\" width=\"426\"/></p><p> A great example is  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.progressive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Progressive  </a> </u>  insurance.

Be More Personal </strong></p><p> One way to establish an emotional connection with customers is to personalize your brand messaging. This is done successfully when you consider their behavior and what campaigns trigger emotions.</p><p> Last year I recall seeing people posting pictures on social media of Coke cans and bottles with their name imprinted on the label.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-11.35.17-AM.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> Good move Coke!</p><p> You had everyone from health enthusiasts to vegans&rsquo; posting your product on social media.</p><p> This campaign epitomizes the notion of &lsquo;connecting your brand with your customer&rsquo;.</p><p> So, how can this help you?</p><p> Try taking a page from Coke&rsquo;s playbook and see how you can incorporate your customers into your products or services.</p><p> As the old adage goes: &ldquo;we buy from people we know and like&rdquo;. Being more personal is the first step.</p><p> <strong>  3. Be More Social </strong></p><p> If you have read my previous post, you&rsquo;ll notice a recurring theme: It pays to be social. Let&rsquo;s face it, if you are not actively engaging in social media, your brand is suffering.</p><p> Brands that understand the importance of being social are naturally perceived as being valuable.</p><p> Now let&rsquo;s take this a step further.</p><p> Brands that are actively involved with social issues can be perceived as valuable because customers understand the value of their purchase.</p><p> They see how their patronage helps a cause.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7MV3HWQHl1s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-11.40.55-AM.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><p> A good case study is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.toms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Toms shoes  </a> </u> . They sell shoes on the premise that for each pair purchased another pair is given to a child in need.</p><p> <strong>  2. Be Beautiful </strong></p><p> In today&rsquo;s highly visual world, consumers are accustom to seeing beautiful images associated with your brand. When building a valuable brand, it is critical to align your brand images to the most current trends and styles.</p><p> The more beautiful your images, the more valuable your brand is to customers as they will naturally resonate with your brand messaging as a result.</p><p> Additionally, you should check the appeal of your offer to see if its still relevant to your customer base.</p><p> For instance, the first time I saw mini water bottles in the grocery aisle, I instantly got excited.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mini-Water-Bottles.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> I mean, come on, who really drinks a whole bottle of water in one sitting.</p><p> This is a great example of how to adapt your product offering to appeal to customers.</p><p> So, if you want to make your brand more valuable, see how you can update your product or service offerings.</p><p> <strong>  1. Be Apart of A Rising Category </strong></p><p> Lastly, one of the best ways to create a valuable brand is to be apart of a rising category.</p><p> If you wish to quickly expand your brand into these burgeoning categories you should consider acquisitions, partnerships, licensing and/or co-branding for your brand.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"554\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/oculus-facebook.png\" width=\"738\"/></p><p> <u>  Facebook </u>  is a great case study.</p><p> To stay valuable to users is has acquired  <u>  <a href=\"https://instagram.com/JuntaeDeLane/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Instagram  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Oculus  </a> </u>  and attempted to buy Snapchat for $3 Billion.</p><p> Now some of you may not have the bandwidth to acquire such companies but you should understand the strategy behind Facebook&rsquo;s efforts.</p><p> <strong>  Conclusion </strong></p><p> Building a more valuable brand takes time and effort along with a great strategy.</p><p> You must make your brand more convenient to customers, personalize your product offerings, be more social and beautiful and expand your brand into flourishing markets.</p><p> Whether you new or establish brand, building a valuable brand not only affects customer perception but can affect your profits.</p>",

However, staying in your style comfort zone can become routine and you begin to find yourself wearing the same items over and over again.   Imagine if you got a little adventurous and took a walk on the wild side of mixing stripes and paisleys and checks &ndash; OH MY!!  The combinations would be anything but cowardly.  </p><p> Face your fashion fears and follow these simple rules the next time you decide to mix it up:</p><p> Use one solid color as home base &ndash; either a solid shirt or if you are a pattern &ldquo;mirgin&rdquo; (mixing pattern virgin), I recommend starting out with a solid suit color, combine it with a striped shirt and checkered tie. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-1.59.24-PM_0.png\" width=\"240\"/></p><p> You can never go wrong (better yet it would be hard to go wrong) with opposing patterns &ndash;try checks with stripes.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-2.08.32-PM.png\" width=\"240\"/></p><p> Pay attention to pattern size &ndash; balance out larger prints with smaller ones.

Shake things up by incorporating florals, polka dots, and paisleys into your look.  Maybe you find a good duo in a check shirt paired with a polka dot tie and you throw a paisley pocket square in as a mixer.  Be daring.  Get creative.  Find a combination that works for you and most important makes you feel your best.

    "title": "It's the Highest Standard for Advisors, but Wasn't Madoff a Fiduciary?",
    "link": "its-the-highest-standard-for-advisors-but-wasnt-madoff-a-fiduciary",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In your search for a financial advisor, one of the most vexing words that you&rsquo;ll come across is &ldquo;fiduciary.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re likely to hear it a lot because the fiduciary issue is making news headlines.</p><p> <strong>  What it Means </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with the basic meaning of the word. First of all, you may have noticed that &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; is both a noun and an adjective. An advisor can be a fiduciary, which as a noun means an asset manger who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust between himself or herself and you, assuming you're the client.</p><p> <strong>  Why is a fiduciary relationship so special? </strong></p><p> When used as an adjective, &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; as in relationship, you place confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in this fiduciary duty. It means by law the fiduciary investment advisor must always place the client&rsquo;s interests above their own, regardless of any potential profit to the fiduciary. In other words, they offer unbiased advice.</p><p> Among lawyers and finance managers, a fiduciary duty is the highest standard of conduct. A fiduciary is expected to have undivided loyalty to the person to whom he or she serves, such that there is no conflict of interest between fiduciary and client.</p><p> <strong>  Aren&rsquo;t all advisors fiduciaries? </strong></p><p> Not yet but regulators are hotly debating it right now, but the fact is most advisors are not. Instead, they use a different standard known as &ldquo;suitability.&rdquo; While it&rsquo;s a subtle distinction, in some cases it can be very important. Under the standard of suitability, a financial advisor or asset manager is not required to place the client&rsquo;s interests above their own in every case; instead, they&rsquo;re obligated to recommend actions or investments that are merely &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; for their clients. These advisors, in most cases, get their paychecks from the commissions generated by your transactions. Clearly, your interests are not aligned. The suitability standard is not a code of ethics anyone would want an investment advisor to adhere to.</p><p> <strong>  The suitability standard protects the advisor, not you </strong></p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example. Say you&rsquo;re working with an investment advisor who is paid commissions and is in a position to recommend that you buy one of two annuities. Annuity A is an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; product for which the advisor will earn a nice fat commission. Annuity B is an outside product for which the advisor will earn a much smaller commission. Your advisor recommends that you buy Policy A. Gee. Why? Is it really the very best choice for you, or is it a &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; choice and your advisor will earn that bigger commission payout? Most people never realize they may have just paid seven percent in commissions for an annuity they never needed. The advice was in the advisor&rsquo;s best interest. Using a suitability standard, the advisor can defend his recommendation. On the other hand, the fee-only fiduciary advisor isn&rsquo;t likely to recommend any investment unless it really is the very best choice for you. There&rsquo;s no profit motivation. Sounds like the fiduciary role protects you from bad behavior. Well, that&rsquo;s the way it should work.</p><p> <strong>  This is a no-brainer, the fiduciary standard is better </strong></p><p> Yes absolutely, with the understanding that the fiduciary mantle is only as good as the advisor who wears it. The fiduciary as a standard is an obvious better choice because it&rsquo;s a higher legal hurdle. Not so simple when you&rsquo;re applying standards to human behavior. Investment advisors operating under this higher standard can still be completely incompetent or even dishonest as an investment manager. Relying on the fact that your advisor is legally operating in your best interest can give you a false sense of security.</p><p> <strong>  One name will make this very clear: Bernie Madoff. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s an extreme example, but you get my point. On my television series, MoneyTrack on PBS, I&rsquo;ve interviewed dozens of victims scammed by brokers who were not fiduciaries but also by investment advisors who were operating as fiduciaries. Madoff was a broker for most of his career&mdash;a position that does not require a fiduciary duty&mdash;but when he registered as an investment advisor in 2006, he took on a fiduciary duty to his clients.</p><p> Bernie&rsquo;s the poster child to illustrate that fiduciary status doesn&rsquo;t guarantee honesty. At the end of the day, fiduciary status cannot guarantee any level of competence. Operating under this higher standard does make an advisor more accountable and is something an investor should ask about as part of their screening process. Just don't rely on it as the only choice of advisor. The fiduciary standard is intended to protect you. And at the same time, I know some excellent, skilled advisors who put clients first but work for firms still operating under the lessor suitability standard.</p><p> <strong>  The Educated Consumer </strong></p><p> What can you do to gate out potential abuses, bad behavior and conflicts of interest? It&rsquo;s best to ask really good questions of the advisor you&rsquo;re interviewing. Ask him or her point blank: Are you a fiduciary? Show me, in writing what I will pay in fees&mdash;all in. Explain how you make investment choices. Do you sell any investments under your own company&rsquo;s brand name, or that your firm has packaged where you earn a commission? Even if and advisor claims to be an independent, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not beholden to a brokerage firm. Ask how much of his or her income comes from commissions. It&rsquo;s all about transparency.</p><p> <strong>  Separate the assets from the advisor </strong></p><p> Make sure whatever assets your advisor is assigned to invest or oversee are held at a separate, independent institution, typically a well-known custodian (think: bank or name-brand brokerage). Your investments need to be separated from your advisor&rsquo;s firm to make sure there are always two separate statements that agree and support the advisor&rsquo;s performance reports.</p><p> Personally, if I were interviewing an advisor for the very first time, the fiduciary question would come up right away. To me, it just makes sense that professional advisors operate under rules requiring them to act as fiduciaries when they manage other people&rsquo;s money. But with all the scams I&rsquo;ve seen, by no means would I rely on the fiduciary label alone. There are a lot of qualified professionals who can help you accomplish your goals. Some are RIA's, some work for large institutions. Don't expect brokerage houses to adopt the fiduciary standard anytime soon. Interview your potential advisor asking very pointed questions. Fiduciary or not, you&rsquo;re smart to thoroughly vet any advisor before signing on.</p>",

    "content": "Much has been said about the democratisation of photography &ndash; how applications such as Instagram and the rise of smartphones usage has made photography accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background, or the amount the time and money they invested in practicing and studying the craft of creating meaningful visual stories.The impact is not only visible on the way we are creating, but also on the way we&rsquo;re circulating this content. You don&rsquo;t need to be a household name anymore to be able to share your photos with the world. Heck, you don&rsquo;t even need to be talented at all. Though some professional photographers welcome those new digital mediums and don&rsquo;t feel threatened by the impressive and constant stream of images we&rsquo;re now all producing, <u> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/dec/13/death-of-photography-camera-phones\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  others are accusing smartphones of killing photography as an art form </a></u>.Smartphones, by nature, are not made for photography as a craft, they are made for communication. And this is how most of our generation is using them: to share and document our lives. Sharing photos on social networks, be it in an ephemeral way with Snapchat, or a more permanent one with Facebook and Instagram, has become central to the way we experience, capture, and remember small and big moments in our lives. We are now sharing and uploading <u> <a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a staggering 1.8 billion photos a day </a></u>.It is obvious that the mass adoption of smartphones and social networks has profoundly changed the way we capture and share our experiences, but how has it influenced the way we actually experience those moments? Are we thinking so much about how we will tell those stories to our friends and to the world that it hinders the way we are actually living them?If you&rsquo;ve been to a concert recently, I&rsquo;m sure you have noticed &ndash; and probably have felt quite annoyed at &ndash; the number of people in the audience watching the show through their device&rsquo;s screen. <u> <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/04/22/smartphones-concerts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  According to a T-Mobile study </a></u>, 47% of concert-goers text and email while at a show, and 32% of them engage in social media during a show. Some artists such as Pink Floyd and Prince find this wall of devices so irritating that they have even asked their fans not to use their phones during their concerts.Why do we feel compelled to shoot photos and videos of live music that we know for a fact we&rsquo;ll never look at again? Is it because we are deluding ourselves in thinking it will help us preserve the memory, or because we want to show everyone that we&rsquo;ve been engaging in something fun, cultural, and social?A very disturbing episode of the dystopian series Black Mirror &ndash; &ldquo;The Entire History Of You&rdquo; &ndash; explores a reality where most people have a &lsquo;grain&rsquo; implant which records everything they do, see or hear. There is even <u> <a href=\"http://getnarrative.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a startup </a></u> that created an automated wearable camera that captures your life at 30 second intervals.Unfortunately, recent <u> <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/12/04/0956797613504438.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  research published in The Journal of Psychological Science </a></u> suggests that taking photos without really investing ourselves in the process may impede our memory. We rely so much on our camera to record our memories that we lack the focus and the attention to properly engrave and remember the experience. This phenomenon has been dubbed thephoto-taking impairment effect, and only happens when we are doing point-and-shoot photos. Spending long enough time taking a photo can eliminate this effect, but it is rarely the case with most photos we&rsquo;re taking with our smartphones.Despite the fact that snapping photos and videos doesn&rsquo;t help us remember our experiences, and literally makes usobserve some of the best moments of our lives through a little screen, we keep doing it to better share our story with the world. Social media is giving us a unique opportunity to cut, edit, and re-shape our life stories for public consumption.

Another side-effect of social media is the now well-known FOMO (&ldquo;fear of missing out&rdquo;) effect, defined as the anxiety that an exciting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website.The constant social pressure explains why new, more intimate social platforms such as Snapchat are proving so popular. In <u> <a href=\"https://medium.com/backchannel/a-teenagers-view-on-social-media-1df945c09ac6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a great article written by a teenager about social media </a></u> &ndash; if you only click on one link in this article, I recommend you read this post &ndash; the author explains how the absence of comments, likes, or any public number of followers makes Snapchat so addictive and liberating. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get any likes on my Instagram photo or Facebook post within 15 minutes you can sure bet I&rsquo;ll delete it. Snapchat isn&rsquo;t like that at all and really focuses on creating the story of a day in your life, not some filtered, altered, or handpicked highlight. It&rsquo;s the real you&rdquo; writes Andrew in his article.Maybe the next big social network will be the one that finds the perfect balance between recording and remembering, sharing and experiencing. Until then, let&rsquo;s try to find that balance ourselves. ",

Many sales people think (encouraged by their leaders) that more sales calls equals more revenue. It really doesn't.

Having good conversations with prospects that will buy your service offering equals revenue.</p><p> The more research we do before picking up the phone, or writing an e-mail, the easier it will be to start a dialogue. Why? Because people want to feel special, no matter what their title or position is.</p><p> In a consultative sales environment, we don't need to reach out to every single company in the universe.

    "title": "Taxes and Your Portfolio: A Seasonal Primer",
    "link": "taxes-and-your-portfolio-a-seasonal-primer",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> Taxes cannot be an afterthought in investment management.</strong>After asset allocation and fees, taxes most dramatically affect your investment returns. Every step of the investment process - from initial portfolio construction through ongoing portfolio management to realizing portfolio returns - implicates taxes. With tax season upon us, here's a basic primer on how taxes might interact with your portfolio.<strong> Tax Deferral in Portfolio Construction</strong>The taxable status of your investment account(s) is a central portfolio decision. You can use a taxable account, a tax-advantaged (deferred) account, or some combination of taxable or tax-deferred accounts as vehicles to allocate and manage your investment portfolio. A separately managed account (the standard investment vehicle for families and small institutions) is typically taxable. IRAs, 401(k) s, investments held in certain types of trusts, and deferred annuities are common tax-deferred or tax-advantaged investment vehicles. Your choice of investment vehicle should reflect your marginal income tax bracket, level of investments, investment horizon, liquidity needs, and purpose of investment proceeds.The basic tax issue in portfolio construction is the timing of the tax incidence: tax is payable upon realized gain in taxable accounts, but is deferred in time or otherwise offset in tax-advantaged accounts. Relative to taxable accounts, tax-advantaged accounts often place significant limitations &ndash; as caps on investment value, limits on withdrawals, and/or narrowly defined uses for withdrawals &ndash; upon the account holder, which may limit their use for any particular investor or portfolio. Violations of these limitations may cause a tax-advantaged account to lose its tax-deferred (or other special) status and become taxable.<strong> Tax-deferral can be a valuable boost to your investment portfolio.</strong>Assuming your portfolio experiences a constant rate of growth, the present value difference between deferring and realizing gains as accrued can be over 10% in value after 10-15 years of deferral. The difference continues to grow with longer deferral horizons.By investing in a tax-deferred account you are also showing an implicit preference for being taxed at future, rather than at current, tax rates; the preference is reversed if you choose to invest through a taxable account. So if you expect your marginal income tax rate in the future (say, during retirement) to be much lower than your present rate, tax-deferral may become especially attractive. But if tax rates rise substantially over the course of your investment horizon, the benefits of tax-deferral may be significantly eroded.Given the limitations of use on tax-advantaged accounts, a basic principle of tax-efficient investing is to make tax-efficient investments through taxable accounts, and tax-inefficient investments through tax-advantaged accounts. A taxable account is typically suitable for investments in individual stocks and bonds held for over a year; stocks or funds that pay qualified dividends; municipal bonds (generally exempt from federal tax); or &ldquo;tax-managed&rdquo; stock or bond funds. On the other hand, tax-advantaged accounts should be generally reserved for securities held for less than a year; bonds or funds that generate high yields or non-qualified dividends; actively traded funds; and income from pass-through entities like LLCs or REITS. [Click <a href=\"http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/resource_center/expert_insight/personal_finance/tax/tax_efficient_investing_is_more_important_than_ever.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a> to learn more about where tax-smart investors place their investments.]<strong> Tax Implications of Portfolio Turnover</strong>The taxable status of your investment account also matters when rebalancing your portfolio to maintain a target allocation across different asset and sub-asset classes. Rebalancing essentially entails selling 'outperformers' and buying 'underperformers,' incurring long or short term gains in the process. To offset this, you should rebalance as far as possible in a tax-deferred account, or 'rebalance' by using new capital infusions to selectively buy 'underperformers.' Similarly, actively-traded investments and strategies (generating short-term gains) should ideally be pursued through tax-advantaged accounts. [Click here for more on active versus passive asset management styles.]More broadly, the timing of investment gains dramatically affects your realized portfolio return. Investment gains are typically classified as Long-term Capital Gains (selling an asset owned for longer than 12 months for profit), Short-term Capital Gains (selling an asset owned for less than 12 months for profit), Ordinary Income (typically includes interest payments and unqualified dividends), and Qualified Dividends. [Click <a href=\"http://www.finweb.com/investing/portfolio-income-and-taxes.html#axzz2PWJptiHH\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a> to learn more about the taxable status of different investments.] Tax rates on investment gains <a href=\"https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/retirement_and_planning/taxes/resources/taxes-whats-new\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> vary</a> based on your income tax bracket and marital status. At the top income bracket, Long-term Capital Gains and Qualified Dividends are currently taxed at 20%; Short-term Capital Gains and Ordinary Income at 39.6%. The implication here is clear: if you're generating a lot of interest income and short term capital gains in your portfolio (on which you're paying twice the tax you otherwise might pay!), it better make sense as part of your larger financial goals and investment approach.<strong> Wealth and Income Effects of Changing Tax Rates</strong>Finally, here's a little thought experiment on changing tax rates and your psychology as an investor. Changing tax rates are known to affect your savings and investment choices through the Income Effect and the Wealth Effect.If tax rates rise, your disposable income reduces, which might force you to reduce the amount you customarily save and invest. To maintain your original expected 'payoff' at retirement, you now invest in riskier assets to offset the reduction in initial investment. You're effectively trying to do more with less &ndash; this is the Income Effect at work. On the other hand, rising taxes (and lower after-tax income) might make you feel 'poorer' and less secure about your retirement. In other words, you become more risk-averse. To compensate, you invest more conservatively because you now have less 'wealth to lose' &ndash; this is the Wealth Effect at work.How these two opposing forces play out is a function of your wealth and income levels, your &lsquo;marginal utilities&rsquo; of wealth and income, and their sensitivity to changing tax rates. Your investment adviser, who should have a through grasp of your risk tolerance and future cash flow needs, can help you anticipate and address the effects of changing tax rates on your portfolio.<strong> The Bottom Line</strong>Taxes should be a primary and ongoing focus of every investor. Consistent with your investment goals, liquidity needs, and risk profile, you should strive to maximize your after-tax returns. And your investment adviser's tax sophistication is central to your portfolio health.",

    "content": "<p> Finger-pointing in the workplace is fairly common, especially if the person doing the pointing is feeling insecure about their job, or themselves. So how do you address that?</p><p> We have all blamed someone or something at some point, but if you dig a little deeper, you will find that the blame was simply avoiding your own responsibility in the situation.</p><p> If you find yourself quick to blame others for what&rsquo;s not working in your life, take a good look at what drives this thought.</p><p> If you judge others for what they are not capable of, but forget that many of the things you stand in judgment for are the same things you do, where&rsquo;s the disconnect?</p><p> One of the ways in which we learn to step out of blame is&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Take 100% responsibility for all your choices and decisions. </strong></p><p> There is no one else to blame for wrong choices, wrong decisions or mistakes that could have been avoided. But that&rsquo;s easier said than done, right?</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been married for over 35 years, and in that time, we&rsquo;ve done plenty of blaming. But my responsibility was made perfectly clear one day when he told me I had made a choice to be with him, and therefore anything that happened was because I was accepting it. It was my choice.</p><p> This is an interesting concept. When I examined my life from the earliest days until now, I could see many instances where I had made the wrong choices or decisions, and it was no one&rsquo;s fault but my own.</p><p> This is a hard one for many to swallow, but it&rsquo;s actually the truth. We are all 100% responsible for pretty much everything that happens in our life, even when it looks like we had nothing to do with it. At some point, you made a decision, right or wrong.</p><p> It takes practice and constant repetition of new behavior to change things and accept responsibility for the outcomes. But it&rsquo;s not impossible, and to step out of the blame game you must begin to review your choices, decisions and actions that lead to the situation.</p><p> Start by asking yourself some basic questions:</p><p> When things go wrong, do you quickly blame other people or circumstances for the results? Do you universally lump people together as &lsquo;incompetents&rsquo; or &lsquo;unlikable&rsquo;?</p><p> What would happen if you took a more exploratory role in finding out what people need, or want? Do you think you could find a different response? After all, mistakes are part of the growth process. We are all failing our way to success.</p><p> <strong>  Even when it doesn&rsquo;t look like it, we made a choice to engage with the circumstance or person.  </strong></p><p> Are you living with a list of rules and regulations that when violated condemn anyone who crosses the line? Do you seek perfection and are disappointed in yourself or in others when it is not reached?</p><p> <strong>  Perfection is an illusion. Things can be almost perfect, but rarely are. Life is continual growth, or we stagnate. </strong></p><p> Is there a need to be right operating in your world? Do you insist on being right, even when all the evidence says you are wrong? Does it lead to defensive behavior in order to justify your opinions?</p><p> <strong>  What would your world look like if you accepted that you were wrong and moved on? </strong></p><p> Stepping out the blame game is a choice? Taking 100% responsibility for your life is a choice.</p><p> <strong>  Ask yourself this: </strong></p><p> What will it take for me to step away from blaming people and circumstances for any discontent or unhappiness in my life? How could I do this differently?</p><p> Making better choices, taking full responsibility for EVERYTHING in your life, and being willing to change what&rsquo;s not working for you is the first step toward becoming someone you can admire.</p><p> Last note: Remember when one finger is pointing forward, there are three more pointing back at you.</p>",

The first, regarding technology, Raef answered in his  <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/client-service/webinar-qa-next-wave-financial-planning/?cmpid=ADV-BL-NWFPP2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Practically Speaking blog post two weeks ago.  </a> </u>  The others focused mainly on fees. Specifically, our suggestion, that while we don&rsquo;t hear much today, we look at advisory fees as being at a fork in the road, due to the influence  of a more educated client, demands for more transparency, client &ldquo;validators&rdquo; and the growth of robo-advisors. The whitepaper suggested that advisors should prepare for a shift when it comes to fees &ndash; it looks like that shift is starting sooner than we expected.</p><p> <strong>  When one client asks, are three thinking it? </strong> <br/> <br/> Earlier this week, I got an email and a call from an advisor asking for some advice about addressing a recent email from one of his clients. The advisor wrote:</p><p> &ldquo;One of my bigger clients, who I charge a flat 50bps fee, was asking why my compensation was based on a percentage of assets. He has no problem paying me for my financial planning advice, which he told me he values greatly. He also knows that he&rsquo;s getting a good value and that he would probably pay more at another firm. He just doesn&rsquo;t understand why my comp is asset based, rather than a flat annual fee, and that it increases simply because he rolls over a 401(k) or invests his bonus in his NQ account. His point is that he doesn&rsquo;t think it takes me any more time to service him when his account is $2.5mm than when it was $2mm.&rdquo;</p><p> So, how would you answer this question from the client? (Go ahead, think about it&hellip; I&rsquo;ll wait.)</p><p> <strong>  Who else does this? </strong></p><p> The client was expressing exactly what we have been discussing on these pages for almost four years, and why we made this one of the key takeaways from the whitepaper. A business model of providing comprehensive, real advice around real issues like retirement, estate or risk management that a client truly values, and yet pricing the service in an AUM fee (which the client doesn&rsquo;t value) doesn&rsquo;t seem to make sense.</p><p> Secondarily, not charging separate planning fees (upfront, before the work is done) can cheapen the value of the advice you deliver anyway. Can you think of any other business that says, &ldquo;I will do 10 &ndash; 20 hours of very valuable work for you, if you promise to buy a separate commoditized product from me later, and as long as you keep paying for that commoditized product, I will keep performing the service you value?&rdquo;</p><p> The nice part about my discussion with the advisor was that he was already looking at changing his fee schedule. In fact, as we talked, I could feel he was actually validating what he had been thinking for a while, versus looking for answers. His notion of a smaller &ldquo;access fee&rdquo; or &ldquo;investment oversight fee&rdquo; (he was trying out ideas on what to call it) of 25-30bps for his investment services, coupled with financial planning fees and other service fees, were coming out easily, so you could tell this wasn&rsquo;t the first time he had considered it. In fact, he was toying with creating an almost modular financial planning fee schedule, which would allow clients to practically select from a menu for their planning concerns.</p><p> <strong>  First, understand your value </strong></p><p> While the philosophical discussion around fees was good, we had to get to the real world of how to price the advisor&rsquo;s services. Because many firms are different in their offerings, there are not a lot of benchmarks or industry research on how advisors should price themselves. (There is a ton on what they are doing, but there is no really &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; of what things should cost.) As we talked, we settled on a few ideas to get started.</p><p> &bull;  <strong>  Understand and be able to communicate your value proposition. </strong>  If you can&rsquo;t clearly articulate what you do and who you do it for, how can you charge for your services? If you cannot communicate your value, why would anyone want to hire you? <br/> &bull;  <strong>  Know your clients. </strong>  Do you have a niche? Are there other non-investment-related services that your niche needs/wants that you can provide? Even better, can you charge for them? I am not suggesting nickel and diming a client, but if there is a value-add service that you can provide, why not look at it? <br/> &bull;  <strong>  Know what you are worth. </strong>  Once you know your true value proposition, step back and look at your &ldquo;hourly rate&rdquo; ( <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/practice-efficiency/advisors-get-bigger-by-getting-smaller/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here is an easy way to estimate your hourly rate  </a> </u> ). If a client is asking you to put in hours of research to solve issues, by knowing your hourly rate, you can more easily justify and communicate your planning fees. <br/> &bull;  <strong>  Know what it costs you to service your client </strong>  ( <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/client-service/math-is-hard-getting-bigger-by-getting-smaller-part-2/?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here is an easy way to estimate your SCPC  </a> </u> ). How can anyone reasonably come up with pricing for their services, without knowing what it costs to provide those services? <br/> <br/> <strong>  If you build it, will they come? </strong></p><p> Obviously, the big question in all of this is: Will the client actually write checks for planning, rather than having a percentage come out of their investment portfolios? If we are not showing real value, the answer will be no. It is my belief, however, that if the client sees value, they will pay. It is also important that the client sees activity other than investment-related ideas. What are those activities? I&rsquo;m sure you are already doing a bunch of activities and have even more ideas. </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  A lovely little Spanish archipelago in the western Mediterranean, </strong> the Belearic Islands are about as different as can be considering their proximity to one another. Simply beautiful scenery, however, is a hallmark of all. From the heavily populated island of Mallorca, to the quiet nature preserve on Cabrera, these islands offer a full menu of Mediterranean experiences.</p><p> <strong>  This elegant, eight day itinerary easily expands to include embrace additional destinations, but stands alone as one of the most delightful of Mediterranean holidays. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Day 1: </strong> Palma is the largest city on the island of Mallorca. Also the capital, it is a major European holiday destination, nurturing an extravagant nightlife with bars, discos, and pubs along the Paseo Maritimo waterfront that don't even get started until midnight, often still going strong till 6 a.m. The likes of Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, and Marlene Dietrich frequented the district, as do modern high profile personalities. Still, the island also hosts a number of historic and cultural sights, along with pretty beaches and small, quiet, picturesque towns. Your escape to solitude, however, is an easy tender to your private yacht charter, where peace and quiet reign supreme.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-02-at-12.36.13-PM.png\" width=\"938\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 2: </strong> Prepare for a nice long morning on the water, with the four-and-a-half hour passage to Ibiza, where you'll find another busy party island, with exceptional restaurants, discos, shops, and social options. There are also perfect beaches, and lovely niches along the coastline that invite anchorage for a serene getaway. Spend the day lounging about Ibiza City, or cruising the coastline.</p><p> <strong>  Day 3: </strong> Heading north around the west end of the island, Sant Antoni di Portmany is a nice stop among great beaches, coves and cays, waiting for your arrival. Another hot spot for late night discos and restaurants, the options include some gorgeous beach stops and beautiful dive sites near Ses Margalides just north of Sant Antoni.</p><p> <strong>  Day 4: </strong> Back over to the north side of Mallorca, a stop at Port Andratx puts you in with some of the Balearic's most stylish company. If you have evening attire with you, Andratx might be a good place to wear it. Excellent dining options in addition to lots of other yachting groups will appear in town. The port itself is lovely, with fortresses, lots of old mansions, and a castle. Diving is a draw around the bay, with lots of secret caves and coves to explore, along with several fine white sand beaches.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-02-at-12.33.04-PM.png\" width=\"1102\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 5: </strong> En route to Puerto Palencia, stop in Soller for a lovely lunch, or just anchor along this picturesque coast and enjoy the dramatic mountains and cliffs dropping directly into the sea. Proceed to the resort town of Puerto Palenca for a protected harbor.</p><p> <strong>  Day 6: </strong> Explore the island of Menorca, following the coastline from Ciutadella, calling at the capital port of Mahon. The ancient ruins, the interesting distilleries, and the waterfront cafes make for an easy cruise along the southern coast of Menorca.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-02-at-12.27.23-PM.png\" width=\"833\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 7: </strong> The Cabrera Archipelago is a beautifully preserved ecosystem off the south coast of Mallorca. Undeveloped, unspoiled, and quite peaceful, permission is required to moor in this land and sea based national park. A peaceful night under a bountiful canopy of glorious stars, you are certain to remember the beauty of this last night in Balearic Islands with a special fondness.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"339\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-02-at-12.13.35-PM.png\" width=\"669\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 8: </strong> Return to Palma de Mallorca.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://whartonmagazine.com/author/emilychisholmmagazine/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Emily Chisholm  </a> </u>  W'16 | <a href=\"http://whartonmagazine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Wharton Magazine  </u> </a> I&rsquo;ve forced myself to the gym after long days in class for three years, but my workouts certainly did not prepare me for an encounter with the boisterous and intelligent  <u>  <a href=\"http://davidpottruck.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David Pottruck, C&rsquo;70, WG&rsquo;72  </a> </u> . At a school like Penn, it is no surprise to have an opportunity to put an indelible personality and face to a name on one of the campus&rsquo; buildings. Among many other acts of generosity, Pottruck has endowed the main student gym. <strong>  As a junior, meeting the man behind the finance legend is an incomparable way to grasp the path to success. </strong> Pottruck was faced with the unique experience of coming from an analog world and adapting to an Internet-centric workplace. At Charles Schwab, his challenge was to compete with E*Trade, which was founded in 1991 and went public in 1996, growing by offering investors the option to trade online. Pottruck and his team recognized the need to adapt to the way that clients preferred to trade en masse. Charles Schwab had branch networks and call centers, and its team was used to people calling to input the data to make a trade.&ldquo;We used to advertise that at $80 per trade, we were 70 percent cheaper than Merril Lynch, and now suddenly we&rsquo;re the high-price guys,&rdquo; Pottruck recalled.To compete with E*Trade, Charles Schwab launched E-Schwab, which was extremely successful at $29.95 per trade.  <u>  <a href=\"https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/1366/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Useem  </a> </u> , who was interviewing Pottruck fireside chat-style, noted that E-Schwab launched on January 15, and by December of that year, the market value of the &ldquo;discount&rdquo; investment firm of Charles Schwab exceeded Merril Lynch. Schwab and E-Schwab were No. 1 and 2, and E*Trade came in at No. 3. Useem, Wharton&rsquo;s William and Jacalyn Egan Professor of Management who has taught alongside Pottruck (an adjunct professor) during Wharton Executive Education courses, was not only asking questions but also filling in Pottruck&rsquo;s accomplishments when the finance legend was too humble to brag.Getting back to the story, Charles Schwab became one of the successful players in the market during the time of online expansion, in large part because Pottruck had the insight to respond to what the consumer base wanted.&ldquo;Customers thought that having a Schwab and E-Schwab account was too complicated. We were getting letters by the hundreds every month,&rdquo; Pottruck continued.He and his team believed that for every customer writing them a letter, there were 10 more unhappy customers. <strong>  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t build a business on unhappy customers. </strong> So we had to make a change [to an affordable, integrated online platform]&mdash;which cost us 25 percent of our profits, which meant that everybody had to be on board,&rdquo; he said.Though it was tough to learn how to take on such dramatic change, it was the long-run vision of the company that gave Pottruck the foresight to enact such a pioneering program. Getting everyone on board&mdash;that was another story entirely. His speechwriter at the time told him that he needed to show who he was to the people he was addressing because &ldquo;you have to share with the audience why this matters to you, and reveal who you are and talk about yourself in a way that makes you believable and credible.&rdquo; This way of interacting with his audience, Pottruck told us, has helped him to more effectively communicate his message throughout the years.Pottruck, who had long served as Chuck Schwab&rsquo;s &ldquo;right-hand man,&rdquo; went on to serve as co-CEO with the founder from 1998 to May 2003, when Pottruck became sole CEO. In July 2004, the company board ended his role at Charles Schwab after he and Schwab built it into a company with over a $1 trillion in customer assets. Since then, he&rsquo;s become chairman of HighTower Advisors, a wealth management firm he helped launch in 2008, as well as chairman of CorpU, a leadership training firm. Pottruck serves on Intel&rsquo;s board. He also recently wrote a book,  <u>  Stacking the Deck: How to Lead Breakthrough Change Against Any Odds </u> , the reason why he was giving the lecture on campus for  <u>  <a href=\"https://leadershipcenter.wharton.upenn.edu/leaders-wharton/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wharton Leadership&rsquo;s Authors@Wharton Speaker Series  </a> </u> .What stuck with me from his February lecture comes down to this: <strong>  Who are you, and why do you care? You have to be willing to reveal yourself to be worthy of trust and commitment. </strong> &ldquo;LISTEN. Nobody does this well enough. Come to the conversation curious.  Don&rsquo;t let someone talk just to let them talk. I want to know what you have to say. What do you think of that? How did that idea come to you? Really want to listen. Get out of your head and into someone else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was what Pottruck said in his closing remarks.Though Pottruck&rsquo;s was a well-wrought path to success, the obstacles he encountered were numerous and challenging. It is often hard to remember that although there are usually many similar factors that contribute to success, each person&rsquo;s story is a different one. It is so refreshing as an undergrad to hear this unique story of success and to know that believing in your message&mdash;and yourself&mdash;is half the battle.I know I am not alone in the Penn community as someone who constantly evaluates her every move, weighing outcomes and others&rsquo; influences on whether I should take a risk or not. While it is good to take careful consideration of our actions, sometimes it can be paralyzing to consistently worry about the outcomes of a decision. As we mold ourselves into intelligent and conscious individuals, we might do well to give our gut feeling a chance&mdash;if, after careful evaluative reasoning, something feels right to you, it probably is. <strong>  Pottruck&rsquo;s point about communicating this to our audience is crucial: </strong> When you believe something wholeheartedly, offer insight into your thought process, your motivations for your decisions and the outcome you are aiming for. This is the most effective way to get people on board with your goals&mdash;simply because they want to know who you are andwhy you are doing what you&rsquo;re doing. Employers and team members want to see the layers of our commitment to the projects and ideas we propose.As I enter the stage of my life that requires me to make huge career decisions about how I want to spend every day of my week, how compelled am I to excel and effect change in an industry?All of us Penn students might consider that the areas in which we will be happiest are those that allow us to use our personal strengths, passions and work ethic. Let us not waste our talents for the sake of the norm but instead follow David&rsquo;s advice to take the road less travelled and craft a life experience that is true to our convictions.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Preparing a business plan? </strong> <br/> <br/> Most entrepreneurs follow a more-or-less established organizational format consisting of a number of discrete sections covering technology, marketing and sales, finance, etc. and, of course, an executive summary.  The executive summary normally summarizes the contents of the business plan and succinctly presents the rationale for business success with the goal being to minimize the time it takes for an investor to develop an opinion, hopefully positive.  While an executive summary can be as little as a single page it can easily consume two to three pages with text and perhaps a figure or two.  If not careful it can become a miniature business plan. <br/> <br/> Every plan should have an executive summary, but there is a one-page section of the business plan that I always put into my clients&rsquo; business plans and it is called the Investment Thesis. <br/> <br/> <strong>  INVESTMENT THESIS </strong> <br/> <br/> Entrepreneurs naturally assume and hope that investors will read their business plan and arrive at the correct conclusions that compel investment.  Notwithstanding any earlier presentations by the entrepreneur, an investor will spend very little time with a business plan unless compelling interest is developed quickly (e.g., within a couple of minutes). <br/> <br/> Entrepreneurs, however, can help investors do their evaluation by providing an explicit and succinct statement of the reasons investors should invest&mdash;the Investment Thesis. <br/> <br/> The Investment Thesis is a useful and powerful adjunct to the executive summary if developed properly.  It is a separate one-page section of the business plan of equal rank to the executive summary which will quickly focus investors on your opportunity as they initially scan the table of contents.  Imagine when you prepare the investment thesis that the words in the Investment Thesis are the words the investor would use to convince his/her partners of the value of the opportunity. <br/> <br/> In other words, give the investor the rationale for making an investment and don&rsquo;t leave that to the investor to figure out. <br/> <br/> Below, an actual investment thesis has been extracted from a funded startup&rsquo;s business plan and provided below. Certain information (in [...]) has been redacted, but the basic approach is simple; that is, provide concise, clear headlines followed by supporting comments that validate the headline. The statements, naturally, substantiate the basis for the expected success and value of your company and must be specific and credible.  Keep the number of key points to four or five, no less, no more, and ordered from most significant at the top to lesser points below.  The Investment Thesis should be inserted in the business plan after the executive summary and other introductory or background matter. <br/> <br/> <strong>  EXAMPLE EXPRESSIONS IN AN INVESTMENT THESIS </strong></p><li> <strong>  Large Fast Growing Market </strong>  &ndash; The market for [product category] solutions is currently $[x.x] billion in size. The drivers of this market include the high growth [specify] sectors, [specify submarket] and [specify submarket]. The [specify] market and [specify segments] markets are growing in excess of [x-y]% per year in many cases. These markets alone should make up an estimated $xxx million in sales in [year]. Much of the existing [specify] technology is mature and not as well suited to take advantage of the growth sectors of the [specify] market as is [specify company&rsquo;s product trade name].</li><li> <strong>  Ideal Solution for [specify device type] </strong>  &ndash; The [specify] world is rapidly adjusting to [specify product category] and applications. [Product category] and [product type] products associated with the [market] trend have increased the need for greater [specify], [describe attributes]solutions, lighter weights, lower costs, and the flexibility and durability to handle the growing electronic complexity. [product trade name], with its [describe attributes] technology, represents an ideal solution for [product category] in the [market].</li><li> <strong>  Strategic Partnerships Provide Validation and Drive Growth  </strong> &ndash; [Company name] has developed a number of formal and informal strategic partnerships to help validate [product trade name] technology and grow its business. These include a working relationship with [corporate name] on the R&amp;D and product marketing side; [partner name], a marketing joint venture to license the [product trade name] technology that is in the latter stage of funding; a strategic relationship with [company name] a developer of [technology and products]; and a working relationship with [company name], a manufacturer interested in licensing [technology].</li><li> <strong>  Management Experience in Key Areas </strong>  &ndash; The [company name] management team, including President &amp; CEO [name] and Chairman [name], has deep knowledge of the [industry name] manufacturing industry. They also have significant expertise in supply chain management and optimization within this industry. [Company name] marketing and sales team, including [name] and Vice President of Sales [name], have top level experience in [industry sector]. This broad industry experience provides the know-how to develop the licensing of &ldquo;in-line&rdquo; manufacturing modules to be located in the facilities of [industry] and equipment manufacturers as part of a streamlined electronic products supply chain.</li><li> <strong>  Patented Technology Creates Competitive Advantage </strong>  &ndash; The patented technology of [company name] represents a significant advance in [specify] technologies. This technology has the potential to change the nature of the [market] business by significantly reducing cost, weight and size implications in a range of [product] applications. The patented technology acquired and developed by [company name] presents a formidable barrier to entry to competitors and gives the Company a distinct advantage to capture a significant portion of the [specify] market.</li><p> <br/> Investors examining the business plan and the table of contents will immediately read the section of the business plan called &ldquo;The Investment Thesis&rdquo; because it stands out and demands the first read, even before the executive summary.  By immediately framing the Raison d'&ecirc;tre you positively influence the investors attitude towards your opportunity. <br/> <br/> Make sure the Investment Thesis is perfect and you will be on your way to securing investment.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Today's wealth adviser is faced with a difficult job - creating generational wealth, gaining trust, running an effective practice and balancing it all.  </strong> For the professional who can do all of those things, there is no end to the good you can do and the wealth you can create. I've long believed that this business is a relationship business. </p><p> I fully agree that your understanding of complex investment products, tax laws, insurance opportunities and estate challenges are of critical importance.  There are, however, many wealth professionals that are technically proficient.  I know, some of you are saying that your technical proficiency is what separates you from your competition.  I'm sure you are smart and I'm sure you understand your product offerings.  My point is, shouldn't every wealth adviser have a high level of technical expertise?  I'm not sure it's enough to separate you from the thousands of other advisers out there.  And of course, for those who simply are not technically proficient, do us all a favor - go sell cars! You have an obligation to be technically proficient.</p><p> <strong>  My point is knowledge and information are commodities. Your clients and prospects can get \"information\" from all sorts of sources today - some better than others and most are quicker than you. What they can't get is advice and intimacy. </strong></p><p> So again, I feel relationships trump everything and your ability to build trust comes from a simple formula - people need to like you and to trust you, and when they trust you, they will give you what you ask of them. You don't build trust by knowing the latest and greatest innovative investment solution, tax law or estate law change only.  You do it by taking away a client's pain. You get it by building intimacy, which at its essence is trust.</p><p> So as you continue to build your trusted brand, grow your practice and balance it all, consider these five critical questions to help you be the noble, dynamic trusted adviser that you are:</p><p> <strong>  1.  Do you have a plan to become a million dollar producer, or once again, remain one? </strong> One thing I've noticed that all top producers have in common is a plan and their commitment to that plan. You must remain open-minded but committed to your purpose and plan.</p><p> <strong>  2.  Will you be able to work less 10 years from now while earning more income, and potentially generating greater generational wealth for your clients? </strong>   My point here is, is your practice efficient?  Not just for your sake, but for your client's sake.  Are you able to serve them well, build generational wealth for them and yourself and balance it all?  If so, you are a better partner and adviser for them and you will be rewarded for your value proposition.</p><p> <strong>  3.  How do you add value in your current client relationships? </strong>   (Or, what business are you in today: transaction, fee or service?) This question is all about adding value to build relationships in your book of business. I've seen top producers wrestle with this questions for years now and have found that all three aspects are important. Are you setting up your value proposition as an adviser today to address these topics? If your business is geared on transactions, it may not withstand tough times and an aging, smarter client base.  If your business is fee only, are you in a position to best serve your clients and yourself? I believe we are all in the service business - we must serve others to bring value, live out our purpose and grow our business. Semantics?  I'm not sure today.</p><p> <strong>  4.  Are you (and subsequently, your clients) aware of the risk to which your book (their portfolio) is exposed? </strong> This again is a question that causes you to consider both your technical proficiency and your bedside manner.  Both are critical.  If you don't have a service model and a solution offering that is transparent and easy to understand, you will be exposed in tough times and by enlightened clients and prospects.</p><p> <strong>  5.  Do you have a system in place to limit the number of positions you have in your practice, to a number that you can be held accountable to? </strong> The average $300,000 U.S. producer had 1100 individual securities in his/her book.  That's ineffective.  Again, have a simple, transparent plan, purpose and offerings.</p><p> My goal is to help us re-think the success metrics in this business today and create a better sense of intimacy with our clients.  By asking ourselves questions like this occasionally we can gain a new perspective, create a greater purpose and grow our influence and business accordingly. <strong>  And when did a little self-assessment ever hurt us? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The moment we opened the door I understood the appeal for women. </strong> The d&eacute;cor was beautiful, creams and shades of soft pink, the tables and chairs simple but small enough to be more conducive to intimate conversation. Whether it&rsquo;s called shabby chic or cottage couture, women kept pouring through the door. I too, could feel the sense of comfort, warmth and intimacy; exactly what you want women to feel when women walk through the doors to your practice.</p><p> We have become so accustomed to office d&eacute;cor being designed around traditional more manly office style that even those who feel more progressive with their decorating are still drowning in earth tones, browns and dark woods.</p><p> What is it that prevents us from decorating for women? In most cases, men don&rsquo;t even recognize their surroundings; it&rsquo;s women who notice the details, the d&eacute;cor the design.</p><p> A great example is a man I know redecorated his office to appeal to women and after an initial appointment with a new couple the first thing the woman said when she entered the office was, &ldquo;I love your chairs&rdquo;&hellip; They became a $10,000,000 client!</p><p> As former advisor at Smith Barney, an Advisor I worked with got permission to redecorate her office. In a sea of standard classical office d&eacute;cor (dark cherry desks, tapestry upholstered chairs, etcetera, etc.) with the help of a decorator, Pam began her office transformation. The finished product touted a white marble desk with zebra striped upholstered chairs. The antique white credenza, which housed all her files, was complimented by a glass table with beautiful floral chairs facing a chalkboard framed in white. When the office was finished, not one Advisor said a word but all the women who walked by (and when the coast was clear) poked their head into her office to say &ldquo;I LOVE your office!&rdquo; Her office screamed &ldquo;I get women and want you to feel comfortable&rdquo; which only validated her commitment to helping women become more financially engaged.</p><p> <strong>  Lets face the hard truth&hellip; women WILL HAVE a significant impact on your future success and Financial Advisors out there trying to get their attention. </strong> Are your efforts keeping your existing female clients happy and attracting new ones?</p><li> At some point, all your female clients will be invited to a financial event just for women. If not your event then that of another advisor.</li><li> Most of your female clients will at some point receive educational emails written by women which focus on the issues women care about. If they don&rsquo;t receive these engaging emails from you then they will from another advisor.</li><li> Many of your female clients will be exposed to an office that is designed to appeal to women, creating a warm and inviting environment where women feel welcome, comfortable and important.

    "title": "The 5 Great Myths About Referrals",
    "link": "the-5-great-myths-about-referrals",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  It has been proven that one of the best ways to build your client base is through referrals. But is this really a sustainable strategy? </strong> If you&rsquo;re like many agents and advisors, you&rsquo;re not quite sure how to persuade current clients to regularly offer them up amidst the turmoil. Do you know what may be stopping you from getting the referrals you deserve? Following are a few myths that have spread in the financial industry. Breaking these myths may help you acquire more qualified referrals than you&rsquo;ve seen in the past. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Myth #1: Asking for referrals is the easiest way to get referrals. </strong> <br/> Agents and advisors know that asking for referrals is the most direct way of letting clients know that you want them. However, many are reluctant to ask. This reluctance makes asking for referrals anything but easy &ndash; and for good reason. There are positive ways of asking, however, asking for referrals may imply that you are in a negative position and need more business; or that you are trying to grow a large (and not personal) firm. Moreover, when aggressively asking for referrals, it can be all about you, your business, your sales. In fact, asking for referrals may not be a natural extension of the relationship you&rsquo;ve developed with the client. That&rsquo;s why we sometimes &ldquo;forget&rdquo; to ask even when we&rsquo;ve been told that asking could help us increase referrals.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Some of this industry&rsquo;s top producers receive 100 or more referrals each year without direct solicitation. How do they do it? </strong> They say it&rsquo;s the relationship they have with their clients. How would you rate your client relationships? A periodic proactive call, review meeting or handwritten note can change the way a client feels about you and your organization. It may sound simple, but consistent unexpected acts may give clients just what they need to comfortably, and without prompting, tell others about you. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Myth #2: My clients tell me they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know anyone&rdquo; who needs my services. </strong> <br/> Have you ever heard a client say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know anyone&rsquo; when you made mention of referring? Do you think that&rsquo;s true &ndash; that they actually don&rsquo;t know anyone who may benefit from your services? Chances are they know lots of people, they&rsquo;re just not motivated to give you names right now.  <br/> <br/> One of the most successful strategies I&rsquo;ve seen for giving clients a reason to immediately refer is an event called, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Miss the Boat.&rdquo;  This is similar to a client appreciation event however the only people invited are clients that have referred others to your firm. You tell your clients - \"Mr. Client, don't miss the boat!  We're doing this big event on October 15th on the Detroit Star, that dinner boat on the Detroit River.  It's going to be a gala event with music and dinner and dancing. You and you're wife can get all dressed up!  But, don't miss the boat, because the only people we're inviting are those that have referred clients to us by the event date.\"  This event gives clients an immediate reason to think of someone. Yes, it may be a little gimmicky, but we&rsquo;ve never seen this strategy fail and it has consistently produced referrals of 40 or more per event! <br/> <br/> <strong>  Myth #3: My clients are delighted with our firm but I still don&rsquo;t get referrals. </strong> <br/> By servicing your clients well, beyond their expectations, they will have something to say to others about you. If you service your clients above and beyond with proactive calls and on-the-spot follow-up, not only will you get referrals, you will be able to easily cross sell other products and services. When you service well you are giving your clients something very valuable to talk about! <br/> <br/> <strong>  Myth #4: Referrals will come with account performance.  </strong> <br/> Performance alone seldom gets you the number of referrals you deserve. The reality is that even when accounts are performing well, clients may still not refer to you. Are you listening to your clients? <br/> <br/> In the book, Blink, by Malcolm Gladwell, a study is referenced that was done to find out why some medical surgeons never get sued. When looking at surgeons and their practices, they found that the surgeons that didn&rsquo;t get sued spent on average 3 MINUTES LONGER with each patient. And, during those 3 minutes, the surgeon reportedly just listened. Interestingly, if something went wrong the patient still sued, but it was the Internist, Radiologist or someone else that would get sued, not the surgeon. The patient actually liked the surgeon. When the surgeon listened he was silently yet clearly telling the client, &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;re important enough for me to take a few minutes to hear what you have to say.&rsquo; Hmmmm. We don&rsquo;t sue people we like. We also will do business quicker with people we like. And, we refer others to those we like. Can we deduct then that if we are good listeners we will gather more referrals? <strong>  When we look at top performing practices, it&rsquo;s probably not a coincidence that more than 50% of every meeting is spent listening! </strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>  Myth #5: Referral acquisition is not a real marketing strategy. </strong> <br/> Many of your best clients found their way to your firm through referrals. But do you have a system or process for generating the best new clients into your firm? If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not alone. Having a plan brings focus to obtaining the best leads. Set a goal for how many referrals you&rsquo;d like to receive this year. Determine what you will do each week to accomplish that goal. Write it down and share it with your staff!  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Breaking the referral myths may change your referral fortunes dramatically. </strong> And, the best news is that you can do it without making huge expenditures on traditional marketing. There&rsquo;s nothing mythical about that!</p>",

    "link": "dont-wait-for-prince-charming-5-steps-for-women-to-own-their-financial-power",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theheavypurse/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Shannon Ryan  </a> </u></p><p> As a mother of two daughters who love all things Disney, we were excited to see the new Cinderella movie. The girls loved it, and I appreciated the opportunity to have the &ldquo;Prince Charming&rdquo; discussion with them. Like most fairy tales of good and evil, the lead female or princess is always a damsel in distress who needs to be saved. Only after Prince Charming rescues her, is she able to find true happiness as they live &hellip; well, you know how the story ends. It is a very familiar and appealing storyline to women of all ages!</p><p> But it can also be a dangerous one, especially for young, impressionable girls, if left unchecked. As I shared in  <u>  <a href=\"http://theheavypurse.com/getting-financially-real-my-mom-reclaims-her-money-power/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my Mom&rsquo;s story  </a> </u> , many women dedicate their lives to finding Prince Charming and relinquish all their financial power once they find him. Best case scenario is your partner has no intentions of taking advantage of you but is unfairly burdened with all the financial responsibility and decisions. Worst case scenario, you end up in debt and betrayed by the person who you thought was your Prince Charming. Your happily ever after no longer exists.</p><p> In my conversation with my girls, we shared our favorite parts of the movie but also discussed how Hollywood&rsquo;s version of relationships differ from real life. How women should not seek a savior in their significant other but a partnership, like what I have with their father. Real women do not wait hidden away, waiting for their Prince to find and save them, but become the best they can be first. To understand, your significant other&rsquo;s job isn&rsquo;t to &ldquo;save&rdquo; you, but to be your partner in life and love. I want Lauren and Taylor to understand that being financially able to stand on their own two feet puts them in the best possible position to live their best life, single and in a relationship.</p><h3> 5 Steps for Women to Own their Financial Lives</h3><p> <br/> The steps I am about to share are relevant to both sexes, but I am specifically focusing on women because they have a great tendency to wait until in a relationship to start planning or feel less confident about managing their financial lives on their own.</p><p> <strong>  1. Set Specific Goals, Both Short-and-Long-Term </strong></p><p> As Tanya shared in her post on  <u>  <a href=\"http://theheavypurse.com/breaking-financial-gender-expectations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   breaking financial gender expectations  </a> </u> , she didn&rsquo;t want to set goals as a single person because she felt it wasn&rsquo;t worth the effort. This happens more than you realize. Many successful, modern woman I meet struggle with this, often times unconsciously as Tanya did. This happens for a variety of reasons, including gender expectations and I also find people tend to have very rigid view of goals. They are not set in stone and meant to be fluid.</p><p> It is absolutely okay to change goals, whether single or as a couple, when you realize your desires have changed. Your goals should motivate you. If they don&rsquo;t, then it&rsquo;s definitely time reevaluate and adjust goals.</p><p> <strong>  A Happily Ever After Tip: Give yourself permission to live now. </strong> A partner does not make your life more valuable. You are valuable on your own. Take the time to figure out what you want to do with your life, both now and in the future. Learn to use your goals as a barometer for your money decisions by asking yourself, &ldquo;Will this bring me closer or further away from my goals?&rdquo;. Being able to confidently make good financial decisions is key to creating the life you want, whether single or in a relationship. Start now and you will be a pro by the time you find your Prince Charming.</p><p> <strong>  2. Budget, Eliminate Debt and Build a Cash Reserve </strong></p><p> If you want to own your financial power, you have to understand your current financial reality and see where you stand. Don&rsquo;t dig yourself into a hole, expecting Prince Charming to save you. He may not come around for years or deem you worthy of being rescued when he sees how little you valued your financial power.</p><p> <strong>  Track Your Spending and Create a Budget You Will Follow </strong> : Start by tracking every penny you spend and be sure to spend as normal. You want an accurate picture of where your money goes. This is typically an eye-opening experience as we tend to forget about all those $5 purchases, but they add up quickly. Once you see how you spend your money, you&rsquo;re ready to create a budget. Don&rsquo;t view your budget as a restrictive enemy but a tool to help you spend your money on what matters most.</p><p> <strong>  Create a Plan to Eliminate Debt </strong> : Money is emotional and woman are particularly good at using emotions to justify splurges, sometimes spending more money than they should. If you have consumer debt, don&rsquo;t ignore it. Figure out what emotional triggers cause you to spend, so you can better manage those emotions and begin aggressively paying down your debt. Debt not only robs you of choice and freedom, it is also very unattractive baggage.</p><p> <strong>  Be Prepared for Emergencies and Opportunities </strong> : Some women are also guilty of relying on their credit cards to cover emergencies and opportunities because they lack an adequate cash reserve. It&rsquo;s important to build an appropriate emergency fund &mdash; 3-12 months of expenses &mdash; so you don&rsquo;t add unnecessary debt.</p><p> <strong>  3. Save, Save, Save </strong></p><p> I have noticed a trend where single women are conservative savers. I&rsquo;m not referring to risk tolerance, but how much money they set aside to save and/or invest. They assume once they find their Prince Charming that they will make plans together and then adjust their savings/investment amounts. The danger of that plan is twofold:</p><li> You may not find your significant others for many years, thus putting you behind financially when you do.</li><li> You may not have the savings/investments to do the things you want now or in the future, including being able to retire. <br/>  </li><p> The question women need to ask themselves is &mdash; do we want to depend on someone else for our financial future? I vote no. Put yourself in the driver&rsquo;s seat and figure out how much money you need to save/invest to create the life you want. Investing intimidates many women, but you still need to have a baseline understanding of how investing works, even if you work with a professional. This is where you can really put your money to work for you, so educate yourself and make informed decisions.</p><p> <strong>  4. Create a Plan for Your Financial Goals and Review Often </strong></p><p> One common mistake women make is not taking time to prepare for their own retirement. A good plan considers your living expenses, inflation, investments and income sources as they exist today. Don&rsquo;t wait to create a retirement plan until you&rsquo;re married.</p><p> The two top mistakes women make are not creating a retirement income plan and not considering the need for long-term care. The first is simply making sure you have a plan as to what assets you are going to use while considering taxes and risk exposure. The second involves planning for the day when we can no longer care for ourselves, regardless of how difficult it is to think about. Some of us are already experiencing this with our parents and know the costs are high.</p><p> Life moves fast as we care for those around us, but we have to slow down to make sure we remain financially strong as we age.</p><p> <strong>  5. Protect Your Dreams </strong></p><p> Women are natural protectors, but we often short-change ourselves when it comes to protecting ourselves. Single woman without children often believe they don&rsquo;t need life insurance, which is not always true. Find out whether  <u>  <a href=\"http://theheavypurse.com/who-needs-life-insurance-find-out-if-you-do/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   life insurance makes sense for you  </a> </u> . One insurance that you definitely want to consider is disability. Your financial well-being is fully dependent on your ability to earn an income, so you need to protect yourself against disability, both short-term and permanent.</p><p> Many women (and men too) put their financial lives at risk by not having appropriate disability coverage. We may want to avoid thinking about this, but disability, especially short-term, happens more regularly than most realize. 64% of wage earners believe they have a 2% or less chance of being disabled for 3 months or more during their working career while the actual odds for a worker entering the workforce today are about 25% according to the Long-term care needs must also be evaluated as you may not have a spouse and/or children to care or assist you when you need help, both physically and financially.</p><p> <strong>  Women hold more financial power than ever, but many relinquish their financial decision-making power to their husbands, boyfriends or the person yelling the loudest. Women too often underestimate their own ability to manage their financial life and overestimate their partner&rsquo;s ability to do it right. You are in charge of creating your own happily ever after, which means owning your financial life with pride and confidence. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What do you think of when you think of Millennials? The media loves to paint Millennials as &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo;, &ldquo;risk takers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;thrill seekers.&rdquo; But, surprisingly, when it comes to financial behavior, Millennials are anything but risky. </strong></p><p> In fact, there is evidence that, while emotions and biases play a large part in Millennials&rsquo; investment decisions,  fear leads the list of behavioral influences.</p><p> <strong>  We Millennials grew up during the Internet crash and have witnessed one of the most turbulent market cycles in recent U.S. history. </strong> With the financial crisis of 2008, and the housing bust leading to a recession, many of us have watched our parents struggle with financial security and worry about whether they&rsquo;ll ever be able to retire. Many recent grads have experienced unemployment as a result of the crisis, and many are burdened with significant student loan debt. Good times? Not.</p><p> These experiences during their impressionable years have led many Millennials to take an emotionally driven approach to Financial Planning and to adopt conservative money habits that analysts have compared to the investment behavior of young adults during the Great Depression.</p><p> They tend to be wary of investing in equities, for instance, resorting to a behavioral bias that favors peer narratives and unscientific anecdotes &ndash; such as stories of retirement-age people whose nest eggs were destroyed by the financial crisis &ndash; over careful data analysis.</p><p> In May 2013, Wells Fargo released the results of a study surveying more than 1,400 Millennials, that found that Millennials view the stock market, and most investments, as a risk not worth taking. More than half of Millennials are &ldquo;not very confident&rdquo; or &ldquo;not at all confident&rdquo; about the stock market and many of the Millennials who do consider investing in stocks see the market as a short-term investment. The survey also found that Millennials&rsquo; primary concerns were student loan debt and paying their monthly bills.</p><p> <strong>  In fact, Millennials have not only taken on more student loan debt than any previous generation but they continue to struggle in a challenging job market. </strong> With many Millennials remaining unemployed or underemployed, and with bills and debt as their top priorities, they have very little disposable income for investing. Many, according to a Pew Research poll released in October 2013, did not even begin thinking about saving or establishing a 401(k) until about five years into their careers.</p><p> Additionally, a UBS Wealth Management survey report featured on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bankrate.com  </a> </u>  found that, more 39% of the Millennials surveyed &ndash; more than any other age group &ndash; said that cash is their preferred way to invest money that they don&rsquo;t need for at least ten years. That&rsquo;s three times the number who chose to invest in the stock market, despite the fact that the S&amp;P 500 has gained 17% over the past year while most cash investment yields remain below 1%.</p><p> <strong>  The Danger of Playing it Safe </strong></p><p> The problem with short-term stock investment approaches and dipping in and out of the stock market is that it can work against investors, because short-term investments may be subject to a higher rate of volatility. Instead of looking at the long-term data, which shows that stocks typically outperform other more conservative asset classes over the long run, those young investors are fearful of the short-range volatility, clouding data about the positive potential of long-term investing.</p><p> That reluctance to get into the market can be problematic for long-term portfolio growth because, without the returns from stocks, it can be difficult to reach savings and retirement goals.</p><p> <strong>  Bigger is Not Always Better&hellip;When Finding a Financial Advisor </strong></p><p> With the crash of the big banks and the negative publicity surrounding Wall Street financial firms, Millennials became a generation that looked at financial professionals with mistrust. Instead, they rely more heavily on the Internet, social media, and personal networks for financial advice. Their experience with market volatility and lack of job security has had a significant impact on their attitudes and behaviors toward investing. With very little disposable income after bills and debt payment, Millennials want to feel a sense of security with their investments.</p><p> When it comes to working with a financial professional, &lsquo;old school&rsquo;, traditional banking services are of no interest to them. Bigger is not better in their minds; a smaller, more personalized firm may be able to offer a more hands-on and collaborative approach to investing that Millennials feel more comfortable with.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to Millennials that they find someone they can trust and who can relate to their concerns and be open to new ideas and methods of investing.  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sherman Wealth Management  </a> understands that being a part of the investing process is a must for Millennials. We fill a role for clients who can no longer relate to, or trust, the large financial institutions that once held a stronghold in the marketplace. As Advisory Representatives of Lincoln Financial Securities, the professionals at Sherman Wealth Management provide a personalized plan for investing and help our clients navigate through the difficulty of prioritizing financial obligations.</p><p> <strong>  Remember how it was the overconfidence of the large financial firms and irresponsible investors that brought us the financial crisis in the first place? That Millennial reluctance to let history blindly repeat itself may turn out to be a pretty good thing after all! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  In business, we have a unique opportunity to act on behalf of our customers in ways that extend far beyond the business we transact with them. </strong> In fact, in todays marketing environment it&rsquo;s one of the best, most lasting ways to differentiate our companies, burnish our brands and grow our businesses. It&rsquo;s called customer advocacy. The act of raising our corporate voice and taking action to promote the interests of the people we serve.</p><p> For as long as I have worked in marketing, I have been continually surprised by how deep our business relationships can run. Our best, most loyal customers make big personal investments in us. Naturally, they risk their money by choosing to trade with us. But they also risk their credibility &ndash; maybe even their reputations by recommending us to friends, family or colleagues and referring new business our way. A great customer is our biggest advocate.</p><p> The investment our customers make in us is evident in the durability of our relationships, their forbearance when we err, and their enthusiastic participation when we discuss their needs &ndash; whether its financial planning and wealth management or designing a new living room.</p><p> <strong>  I have been writing a lot lately about the changing relationship between companies and their markets. Gone are the days when a company could behave any way they wanted then spend a bunch of dough on ads to convince us that they were all about solving our problems and delivering our dreams. </strong></p><p> Today, we consumers talk about our experiences with companies. We want a two-sided relationship with the companies we choose to do business with. Why? Because through conversation, social media and personal habit, we advertise the companies whose products, services and behaviors align with our own personal world-views. In this environment, it&rsquo;s not safe for a company to behave badly and expect us not to care. Because eventually we&rsquo;ll find out, and when we do there will be consequences.</p><p> <strong>  This is all good news for business people who are serious about building what I call Generous Enterprises. </strong> These are companies whose business strategies revolve around the well being of their employees, their customers and their supply chains. Generous Enterprises recognize the profound impact they have on their constituencies and make a commitment to act and invest in ways that serve all their interests.</p><p> By actively promoting the well being of your customers and community, you expand the nature of your relationship with them. But how do you go about doing that? Here are three tips to help you figure out what you can do to mean more to your customers. To become more than the place where they pay to get their (your products or services here).</p><li> <strong>  Ask yourself why your clients do business with you. What needs or interests are they trying to fulfill? </strong></li><li> Patrons of a restaurant specializing in organic food are looking for better health through nutrition and they believe organic foods are a superior source for that nutrition.</li><li> Clients of a wealth management firm are interested in seeing the money they have accumulated be protected and grown.</li><li> Customers of a sporting goods store are participants in team or individual sport. They thrive on the fun, exhilaration and camaraderie they get from sport and exercise. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Determine where your company&rsquo;s expertise or authority aligns with the interests of your customers. </strong></li><li> Like their patrons, the restaurant benefits when there is a diverse and plentiful supply of organic vegetables and meats. They also benefit from greater market awareness of the nutritional benefits of organic food</li><li> The wealth management clients and their firms are both interested in transparency, &ndash; understanding the markets and their investments, how they work and why. They want to know they&rsquo;re playing on a level playing field with other, much larger investors</li><li> The sporting goods store, like its clients, is interested in the availability of places and programs that support and promote athletics endeavor. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Identify actions you can take to effect change </strong></li><li> The organic restaurant could launch a blog with commentary from their subject matter experts and patrons sharing news and developments in healthy eating, recipes, and exercise to achieve better health. The restaurant could also lobby for more and better regulations to reduce the expansion of genetically modified foods and toxic chemical misuse.</li><li> The wealth management firm could make its principals and subject matter experts resources to media and public groups lobbying for free and fair markets, investor choice and the establishment of regulations that support the individual investor.</li><li> The sporting good store could make donations to support in-school and community athetics, or offer free instruction or classes to the community to educate people about the benefits of sport and the avoidance of injury. <br/>  </li><p> By taking action to improve conditions for your customers and your company, you have the opportunity to make a positive difference in the lives of people who have never done business with you, but whose appreciation for your efforts on their behalf could have long lasting implications for your company and its business prospects. Just as important, by being a Generous Enterprise, you&rsquo;re contributing to a workplace and world where your customers, employees, community and company are all more prosperous.</p><p> <strong>  This is noble work, and something any company can do. What have you done for your customers (and their like) lately? </strong></p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Wriiten by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThinDifference\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jon Mertz  </u> </a> Most days as a 50-something I feel more like a 20-something. The difference is a few wrinkles and hindsight. Nothing mentors better than shared experiences. ( <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Nothing%20mentors%20better%20than%20shared%20experiences.%22%20~%20%40ThinDifference%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thindifference.com%2F2015%2F03%2F5-things-my-20-something-self-should-do-30-years-later%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tweet to share  </a> </u> ) Part of the reason why I feel like a 20-something is because of what I have learned from Generation Y (aka Millennials). And the reason for this post is due to an email exchange with Heidi Oran.Heidi wrote her thoughts about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thindifference.com/2015/03/5-things-id-tell-my-20-something-self-10-years-later/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what she learned over ten years  </a> </u>  and how those lessons may have helped her when she was 20-something. Now, it is my turn. I have a few more years to look back. By doing this though, it provides a broader perspective when you take the two together. <strong>  What I Would Tell My 20-Something Self Now </strong> If I was given a replay card, here are five things I would definitely do in my 20s. <strong>  #1 &ndash; Take the time to write life goals and philosophy. </strong> As a 20-something, I never wrote down what my life goals were or how I wanted to live, work, and lead. I always felt that I intuitively knew each. Looking back, if I would have taken the time to do this, I would have been more patient in my career development. More than this, I would have built a stronger foundation in which to lead from, develop on, and prosper from.Although my career and life have gone far, I realize now that writing down life goals and a philosophy to life and leadership are really the fuel to keep between the lines as well as go the distance without as much maintenance along the way. <strong>  #2 &ndash; Have a walk-away, walk-on fund. </strong> I am lucky. I have never had an ethical situation at work in which I needed to just walk away. On the other hand, I have had many unexpected events happen. Seven years into my career, I knew the path I was on was not going to be the right long-term one. Add another seven years when the first dot com bust happened in early 2000, the barren job opportunities was scary beyond belief, especially with a young family.Having that six month fund to be able to walk away or walk-on from the rubble would have wise to have. There always unexpected events that happen, and being prepared is more than a motto. Even if the worst did not happen, having the financial foundation to take a month off between jobs would have been refreshing for me and those closest to me. <strong>  #3 &ndash; Be wise financially earlier rather than later. </strong> This advice is related to the previous one. In financial matters, time is your friend. Savings grow through time, surviving the downs and taking advantage of the ups. Just as time is your financial friend, spending is your enemy. Spending to create clutter does not survive the test of time and value. Getting this balance right sooner rather than later will enable much in your life.Money does matter in the way it enables confidence to make changes, support meaningful work, and building a foundation to enjoy the simple things in life. Plan and act accordingly. <strong>  #4 &ndash; Invest in engaging relationships. </strong> I loved my college experiences. There is no other environment in which people come together to learn and exchange ideas. More than this, we challenge each other and we become great friends. And then we graduate and time creates a distance between these interactions and friendships. The lesson within is always to find and have those four to six friends who you can have engaging conversations with. Create that collegiate environment no matter where you are and where you work.More than anything, I miss those relationships and conversations. Keep building those type of relationships as you move from college to work life. Keep a community close to you and get together often to talk, challenge, and more. <strong>  #5 &ndash; Set family values and goals. </strong> Although we talked about it, I wish we would have done it. Early in our family life, we purchased the book by Stephen Covey,  <u>  <a href=\"/category/personal-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families  </a> </u> . It takes effort to sit down with your family and complete this but I believe we would have been a stronger family if we had actually done it. Creating foundations, I have learned in hindsight, matter. They matter a lot. Trust me.Being a &ldquo;happy wanderer&rdquo; in life can run you in circles rather than taking you down a path hand-in-hand. Creating those bonds will create greater happiness. This is not about making each individual conform. Just the opposite. Celebrating the differences of each family member is important to do. With our uniqueness though, there is a common bond and responsibility for each member to recognize and support. <strong>  These are a few highlights that I would tell my 20-something self, if I could go back. </strong> <strong>  Lessons are not one way. </strong> Each age group can learn from another. ( <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Lessons%20are%20not%20one%20way.%20Each%20age%20group%20can%20learn%20from%20another.%22%20~%20%40ThinDifference%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thindifference.com%2F2015%2F03%2F5-things-my-20-something-self-should-do-30-years-later%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tweet to share  </a> </u> ) I have learned much from younger leaders. Younger leaders also need to be open to the insights of older leaders. We don&rsquo;t have to adhere to what we each have to offer. However, we will gain in strength by considering what each has to offer.My teenage sons would probably roll their eyes at me if I tried to convey these lesson learned now. Two points. <strong>  One is each person has to learn through their own experiences. </strong> The stubborn ones will likely make more mistakes than the ones willing to listen and glean. <strong>  The second is this&hellip; </strong> maybe, just maybe, when my teens are in their 20s, they may be more curious about what I write about and find this. I hope it will provide some light forward for them. In the meantime, I hope it sheds some light for all the great 20-somethings out there now. <strong>  Beyond the Lessons: Truths </strong> Beyond the lessons arise certain truths. Truths are just the things we know we should do in order to build a meaningful career.Here are truths that helped me.</p><li> Keep reading to learn, grow, and connect with stories.</li><li> Write to better yourself in thoughts and actions.</li><li> Hard work delivers much.</li><li> Character matters, all the time.</li><li> Results matter and they matter more when done collaboratively.</li><li> Cover the details. They will be the difference between succeeding and failing.</li><strong> Hindsight delivers clarity yet we cannot live by looking back.</strong>(<u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Hindsight%20delivers%20clarity%20yet%20we%20cannot%20live%20by%20looking%20back.%22%20~%20%40ThinDifference%20http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thindifference.com%2F2015%2F03%2F5-things-my-20-something-self-should-do-30-years-later%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  tweet to share </a></u>) We need to live forward. Learning from our experiences will make us better at whatever we do. Sharing our experiences may help someone else along their way.",

Putting an efficient infrastructure of technology, operations and workplace culture in place can be as important as your portfolio when creating a transferrable business.</p><p> We asked three financial advisory experts for their input on what types of administrative factors impact business valuation at all stages of the business lifecycle:</p><h3> If you&rsquo;re updating your operations:</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-06-at-8.47.25-AM.png\" width=\"310\"/></p><p> <strong>  Tim Welsh </strong> <br/> President, Nexus Strategy <br/> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NexusStrategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @NexusStrategy  </u> </a></p><p> Because RIA firms are valued by cash flow, not revenues, operations that reduce the bottom line and expedite client service can directly impact valuation. Here are a few things that can make your firm&rsquo;s administrative procedures more competitive:</p><p> <strong>  1. Digitize your books and records so that they can be easily transferred. </strong> <br/> When you&rsquo;re transitioning clients, having an organized archive ensures that those relationships will continue smoothly.</p><p> <strong>  2. Keep electronic files of trade history and client communication. </strong> <br/> This allows potential buyers to easily perform due diligence and ensure they are obtaining a practice that has been compliant with regulations.</p><p> <strong>  3. Consider a document management system. </strong> <br/> Document management systems can generate a 9% revenue savings for advisors. When applied to a business value multiple, these systems bring a direct impact to the bottom line.</p><h3> If you&rsquo;re merging your business:</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-06-at-8.48.45-AM.png\" width=\"424\"/></p><p> <strong>  Greg Friedman </strong> <br/> CEO of  <a href=\"http://www.junxure.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Junxure  </u> </a>  and CEO of Private Ocean <br/> <u>  @JunxureCEO </u></p><p> When Richard Stone and I merged our two firms, we grew from seven to 25 employees overnight. Aligning cultural fit was just as important as aligning our portfolios. If you are merging your business, consider the following:</p><p> <strong>  1. How rooted are you in your philosophical beliefs? </strong> <br/> Assess how well your approach to client service, growth vs. scale, technology systems and staffing aligns with the merging business.</p><p> <strong>  2. How do you run your business? </strong> <br/> Adapting cultures is an ongoing process, but paying special attention to how each firm works effectively with technology will help when making critical decisions, including how to best use a CRM to centralize the new firm&rsquo;s data and communications.</p><p> <strong>  3. What&rsquo;s the impact on your clients? </strong> <br/> How will you communicate this change to clients, and how will you maintain or adapt your client service levels to meet expectations?

    "content": "<p> Most people would like to think of themselves as a compassionate person. They would like to be known for having a desire and passion for helping others in need.</p><p> The most compassionate people I know, are also the most passionate. However, not all passionate people are compassionate.</p><p> What is it that compassionate people possess that purely passionate people are missing? What is it that prevents passionate people from becoming compassionate people?</p><p> In my own life, it appears that &ldquo;self&rdquo; is the only thing that stands in the way of being truly compassionate. It&rsquo;s not a lack of money or other resources, but an over-abundance of &ldquo;self.&rdquo; When the &ldquo;com&rdquo;is missing from my passion, &ldquo;self&rdquo; is always the culprit.</p><p> Whenever I lack compassion towards those less fortunate, it&rsquo;s because my &ldquo;self&rdquo; is putting itself in the center of my universe, demanding things it feels entitled to, and getting upset when it doesn&rsquo;t get what it wants.</p><p> It&rsquo;s really amazing how much we think about ourselves, and how often we believe (without admitting it) that we are entitled to be treated a certain way, that others should act the way we want them to act.</p><p> <strong>  Compassion Begins With Your Thoughts </strong></p><p> Watch the kinds of thoughts going on in your head:</p><li> When someone else needs help, do you think first about how it will cost you in terms of time and money, rather than how it will affect the other person?</li><li> When something unexpected happens in your personal life, do you think first about how it will affect you?</li><li> When people speak to you, do you think about how what they&rsquo;re saying relates to you, what they&rsquo;re thinking of you, or how you will reply? Or, are you truly interested in how they are being affected.</li><li> Do you think you&rsquo;re entitled to have the world behave the way you want it to behave? When people irritate you, is your &ldquo;self&rdquo; angry because they aren&rsquo;t acting the way you want them to act? <br/>  </li><p> These are self-centered thoughts, and they always get in the way of compassion. These thoughts prevent any feelings of empathy towards others.</p><p> <strong>  Without Action There is No Compassion </strong></p><p> Without action, we only have pity or empathy. Empathy &mdash; putting ourselves in the other person&rsquo;s shoes and trying to imagine what they&rsquo;re going through is the beginning of compassion. We are probably wrong about what they&rsquo;re going through, unless we&rsquo;ve been there ourselves, but unless we at least try to imagine what the other person is feeling, we can&rsquo;t be compassionate.</p><p> Once we&rsquo;ve empathized, and feel their suffering, the second part of compassion is a desire to end that suffering, or at least take some action to ease that suffering in some small way.</p><p> So empathy is very important, but if we are thinking only about ourselves, we can&rsquo;t empathize with others.</p><p> To be compassionate, we must get ourselves out of the way, and think of the other person. When we think about how we should be treated, what we want, how something will affect us, we cannot also be thinking of the other person and how something will affect them, how they should be treated, or what they need.</p><p> <strong>  Compassion is a Think-Act-Feel Process  </strong></p><p> The first step towards compassion is our thoughts. Less about self, and more about others.  Try to feel their suffering, and then to want to end it.</p><p> The next step is take some action to end that suffering. Even the smallest gesture will make you feel like a compassionate person and someone who is making a difference.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t wait until you feel like a compassionate person. Change your thoughts. Take action. The feeling of compassion will always follow. </p>",

Thanks to the work of a variety of pioneers, it has become a recognized approach and&mdash;increasingly&mdash;a crucial tool that philanthropists, government funders, and other investors look to incorporate as they explore potential paths to the social and environmental change they seek. Leaders like the Ford Foundation, the Omidyar Network, F.B. Heron Foundation, the  <u>  MacArthur Foundation </u> , the  <u>  Rockefeller Foundation </u> , and others have helped  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/grants/program-related-investment\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pave the way  </a> </u> , building  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nabimpactinvesting.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the impact investing ecosystem  </a> </u>  by sharing lessons they&rsquo;ve learned over the years&mdash;even the hard ones&mdash;and by finding ways to invest alongside other investors.</p><p> While the field is still answering a variety of key questions&mdash;including what does and doesn&rsquo;t constitute social impact, how to measure and compare returns, and where investors should go to find opportunities&mdash;we have moved beyond the &ldquo;venture&rdquo; phase of impact investing&rsquo;s development. It is maturing from idea to proven concept, ready to scale and show returns. Simply put: we now know enough to say that impact investing works. Not in every case and not always as expected, but it works in the ways that traditional grant making and investing both work: when done well, it delivers significant&mdash;and potentially huge&mdash;long-term value.</p><p> As the impact investing field continues to mature and grow, we expect to see four key trends take hold in the coming year (and beyond):</p><p> <strong>  1. Increasing investment by smaller foundations and family offices, and increasing engagement from wealth advisors </strong> <br/> By some estimates, more than $40 trillion will transfer from baby boomers to millennials over the next 30 years, the largest wealth transfer in history. Whether or not those estimates prove accurate, it&rsquo;s clear that a change is coming. Already, family offices and wealth advisors are reporting more interest in impact investing from clients, at least some of it driven by the increasing prominence of women and millennials. Women are inheriting more wealth and as such making more investment decisions, and studies show that they are more interested in investing in society and the environment. As for millennials: according to the 2014 Deloitte Millennial survey, nearly 30 percent believe business&rsquo;s number one priority should be to improve society. Even as the tools of impact investing are becoming better established, demand for them is growing among the people who increasingly drive decision making within foundations and family offices&mdash;which in turn drives deeper engagement from wealth advisors who are keen to provide top-notch service to their clients.</p><p> <strong>  2. Increasing clustering of investments in particular sectors </strong> <br/> Of course, few (if any) investors are looking for generic &ldquo;impact.&rdquo; Rather, they are looking to use their investments to drive outcomes related to the causes they care about: climate change, education, health care, etc. So it&rsquo;s no surprise that as the impact investing field matures, investors and their investments increasingly cluster around particular sectors. Take the environment, for example. One recent  <a href=\"http://www.packard.org/2014/11/first-study-of-conservation-impact-investment-market-is-released/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   conservation  </u>    </a> report from NatureVest and EKO Asset Management highlights $23.4 billion in documented impact investing transactions between 2009 and 2013. Meanwhile, the  <u>  Divest-Invest campaign </u>  has captured headlines recently, as at least some major funders have promised to get out of oil and gas investments and into clean energy ones. It&rsquo;s one of many field campaigns now helping to motivate investors to seek out climate-related investments. We expect the momentum for climate-related investments to increase as more products and offerings become available, and we expect to see similar movement on education and health-care investing.</p><p> <strong>  3. Multi-stakeholder collaborations </strong> <br/> While the motivations for impact investing differ from investor to investor, many have shared objectives (hence the clustering mentioned above) and different players now see value in executing impact investments together through new and/or expanding partnerships. Along these lines, it&rsquo;s particularly exciting to see that impact investing has begun to expand beyond a core group of foundations and other socially-oriented investors and to attract a wider array of actors. Banks, corporations, and even pension funds are seeking ways to invest with different partners so that their investments yield social as well as financial returns. The tremendous growth in interest in and activities related to pay-for-performance contracts&mdash;such as  <u>  social impact bonds </u>  and  <u>  development impact bonds </u> &mdash;is a key example. Investors see these as potential tools to engage multiple stakeholders from different sectors to leverage government and private resources to generate social impact along with financial returns. Expect to see much more written about these structures and best practices related to them in the coming year.</p><p> <strong>  4. More data </strong> <br/> Performance data&mdash;actual returns&mdash;represent perhaps the field&rsquo;s most important piece of missing information. For more funders and investors to routinely engage in impact investing, they will need to see a more complete track record, generated through better systems for tracking and broader reporting of both financial and social returns. In 2015, expect to see a growing number of industry reports highlighting trends on investment performance. Also expect to see more foundations and individuals sharing the characteristics and performance of their portfolios. Building on great primers and how-to guides from the  <u>  <a href=\"http://casefoundation.org/resource/short-guide-impact-investing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Case Foundation  </a> </u> ,  <u>  World Economic Forum </u> , and others, the field is now moving past merely sharing what impact investing is and beginning to identify concrete practices for how investors can develop and execute their own strategies. As our shared base of knowledge and best practices continues to grow, we can streamline the investment process, reduce transaction costs, and continue to make impact investing more widely accessible.</p><p> While impact investing alone obviously won&rsquo;t solve the world&rsquo;s problems or replace the need for traditional grant making, it is a powerful and increasingly established approach to driving long-term impact and sustainable change. More foundations and other funders will use it to go beyond grant making in the coming year and long after, putting a wide variety of new financial instruments to work in service of their missions.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Not long ago I met the son of a (former) client&hellip;a young man in his mid-twenties now, who is well on the way to pursuing his own professional career and carving out his own place in the world.  To be honest I&rsquo;d never spent that much time talking to him in years gone by &ndash; the occasional &ldquo;hello&rdquo; when I was visiting his parents, perhaps with a minute or two of polite conversation about his studies and sport.  At a superficial level we had &ldquo;known each other&rdquo; since he was perhaps 12 or so.</p><p> He reminded me of a very simple thing that I had done years ago, which I had placed little significance upon, but which he said was a incredibly influential.</p><p> All I did though was buy his parents a book.</p><p> Not just any book I suppose, but one of the classics:  <strong>  The Richest Man In Babylon. </strong></p><p> (If you are interested in financial planning and haven&rsquo;t read it, it is a &ldquo;must read&rdquo;)</p><p> My memory of it was that a local book store was having a big sale (always a magnet to me!) and I wandered in, saw that they were selling this fabulous book for about $10 or something, so I asked how many copies they had. I ended up buying something like 25 copies of it, and promptly gave them all away to my best clients who had young&rsquo;ish children.</p><p> To me it was a useful and highly complementary &ldquo;client gift&rdquo; at a bargain price.  In the year or two that followed I recall getting some nice feedback from a number of the clients, and the usual expressions of gratitude, but I don&rsquo;t recall any earth shattering life changes occurring as a result of it.</p><p> Until recently that is.</p><p> So here we are, about 15 years afterwards, and this young guy says his parents gave him the book.  He decided it was boring after glancing through it at the time. A couple of years later he needed some inspiration for a school project and dragged it out and used it&hellip;and read it.   Since then he has saved a good sum of money, and been prudent when going through university, and avoided bad debt.  He&rsquo;s doing pretty well financially for a young guy (certainly way better than I did at his age).  He&rsquo;s thinking about buying a flat here in one of the more expensive cities in the southern hemisphere&hellip;.</p><p> This casual meeting with a young man I didn&rsquo;t recognise, but who recognised me and initiated the conversation, reinforced the profound impact that professional advisers can have.</p><p> <strong>  We help create and preserve intergenerational wealth. </strong></p><p> I know that could sound a little grandiose and self-serving, however it is true.  When we do our work well and provide sound advice to individuals and their families we can make a significant difference to the life they can have.  When we combine that with providing education and meaningful resources and tools which are more than just promotion of our own services and expertise, we create the opportunity to make lasting behavioural change within entire families.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that there is little or no value in what you do as a professional adviser.</p><p> Frankly, there are not that many professions or careers that have the potential to shape an entire families future quite so overtly.  When we get right down to it the reality is for most professional financial advisers is that we don&rsquo;t have exclusive technical or market knowledge that gives our clients an inside edge over the world around them.  It is the ability to understand and visualise somebody else&rsquo;s aspirations and then help shape their thinking and coach them through a process of change that is the most valuable thing advisers do.</p><p> That really is about changing the future for clients&hellip;helping them attain a different outcome from what they are currently on track for.  Perhaps if we helped more people understand that, getting new clients wouldn&rsquo;t be quite as hard as it seems to be a lot of the time.</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "how-advisors-can-market-to-the-millennial-generation-p2",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/advisors-millennial-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Part 1  </a> </u>  of this series, we became better acquainted with the buying and browsing habits of Millennials. In Part 2, we will take a look at one of the ways in which Advisors can reach this tech-savvy generation. As with each generation (and being a Millennial myself) this group comes with their own set of interests, expectations and abilities.</p><p> Millennials are known to be constantly checking their Instagram and Facebook accounts, as well as their Twitter feed. Our generation has become so attached to our smartphones that when we have to put our phone away for an hour, we don&rsquo;t know what to do with ourselves.  The average Millennial checks his or her smartphone  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238294\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   43 times and spends 5.4 hours  </a> </u>  on social media per day. Some would say we are a Marketer&rsquo;s dream &ndash; always plugged in.</p><p> <strong>  So, what are Advisors to do?  </strong></p><p> Look beyond the traditional marketing strategies and utilize what the Millennial generation has invented. Millennials are the inventors of Social Media and it has quickly become their link to the outside world, far more then even television. It is not going anywhere; so creating a great online reputation on Social Media will only help to build a future with these Millennial clients.</p><p> When it comes to marketing and education, Advisors who want to reach this generation will need to embrace Social Media, but benefiting from this avenue is all about knowing how to use it effectively. A great strategy is all about communicating in the language of the Millennial. Being in the Financial Services industry, <strong>  it is important for Advisor&rsquo;s to be familiar with the major spending habits of this generation </strong> , so that they can speak in the currency that Millennials value.</p><p> <strong>  So, where are Millennials dishing out the dollars for these days? </strong></p><p> Jeff Yang ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/03/opinion/yang-millennials-spending/\" target=\"_blank\">   CNN, 2014  </a> </u> ) suggests that Millennials are much more likely to spend their money on things and experiences that they can share with friends, such as a nice dinner out, a weekend road-trip, or a one-of-a-kind experience. They tend to spend their money on creating memories and experiences, rather than owning big and expensive materials. In  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/03/opinion/yang-millennials-spending/\" target=\"_blank\">   Yang&rsquo;s article  </a> </u> , he discusses the  <u>  top 3 things that Millennials </u>  are spending their money on:</p><li> <strong>  Travel. </strong>  Millennials travel more then any other group, taking on average 9 leisure trips a year.</li><li> <strong>  Technology. </strong>  Millennials are redeploying their spending from televisions to mobile devices. 45% of twenty something year olds say it is important to them to have the latest features or styles in smartphones. They don&rsquo;t see this as just a gadget but as the primary way they connect with friends, family, and the outside world (social media).</li><li> <strong>  Training. </strong>   Millennials are spending more on education than any prior generation to date. The average millennial graduates with a $30,000 student loan burden. <br/>  </li><p> In order to connect with a Millennial as an Advisor, why not put things in the currency that they value (experiences, travel, concerts, food, digital media, education) and through the medium that they communicate (social media). Although you are an Advisor, and your expertise is in finance, wealth and management, position your Social Media strategy in the context of what this generation values most based on their spending habits.  Create and share content on your Social Media platforms that speak about how to save for a vacation, or school, or point out the experiences that they may miss out on if they don&rsquo;t manage their money effectively. Below are some examples of some great topics that would tie together both your expertise and Millennials interests:</p><li> Creative ways to save for a vacation</li><li> How to save money while travelling</li><li> Should you invest or pay off student loans?</li><li> Strategies to dig yourself out of student loan debt</li><li> 10 tips to save money for leisure activities <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Advisors: </strong> Establish a presence on the avenues that Millennials are spending the most time on, and tailor your created and curated content to information and insights that are relevant to us, without being overly commercial.</p><p> <strong>  Millennials can be a difficult yet rewarding demographic for Advisors. </strong> Stay tuned for more articles in this series on How Advisors Can Market to the Millennials Generation.</p>",

    "title": "Building Your Social ID: The Elements of a Strong Digital Reputation",
    "link": "building-your-social-id-the-elements-of-a-strong-digital-reputation",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s your brand reputation is in the digital space? Here are the factors involved in truly helping you connect with customers and develop a positive Social ID. </strong></p><p> What&rsquo;s your Social ID? What identifies your brand (personal or corporate) throughout your social media interactions and offerings? If your answer starts with the colors of your website, you need to think very carefully about where you&rsquo;re focusing your brand identity efforts. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that colors and logos and graphic elements aren&rsquo;t important, but I  am  suggesting that the way you interact with others online is more important. That&rsquo;s what will catch the most attention &hellip; and hold it the longest.</p><p> Your Social ID is really a measure of two things: 1) the way you  socially comport yourself online , and 2) your brand reputation in the digital space. So what does that really mean? What specific actions does a Social ID include? No matter what your brand purpose is or what products and/or services you provide, all of the following factors can influence your Social ID:</p><li> <strong>  Responsiveness: </strong>  How responsive are you in your social communications? Are you monitoring the right channels? Do you have a social governance policy in place so your employees know what to share and how to respond? In the old days, the squeaky wheel got the oil. But today&rsquo;s digital natives require more than form letters in response to complaints. They want attention from you on the social channels they prefer, and they want it now. But they also watch how you respond not just to complaints, but to inquiries, suggestions and kudos from other people. In short, you need to develop a top-down customer service attitude across your social profiles and keep it real.</li><li> <strong>  Thought Leadership: </strong>  How innovative are your ideas? Are you content to say what&rsquo;s already been said, or do you share your unique insights to provide real value to your audience? Whether or not you realize it, your audience is watching what you say (and what you don&rsquo;t say) and comparing notes with your competitors. Stagnant feeds and haphazard posting has a negative impact on your social reputation.</li><li> <strong>  Content Creation: </strong>  Are you just re-hashing the other guy&rsquo;s information, or are you creating new content in new ways your audience can use and re-use on your behalf? We all have to be publishers in today&rsquo;s world and differentiate ourselves from the pack. Develop a robust content strategy, and empower your employees and customers to share that content on their own feeds. Everyone has a sphere of influence. It&rsquo;s been said that content is still king, but engagement is queen, and she rules the house! Use that to your advantage.</li><li> <strong>  Relevance: </strong>  Do you pay enough attention to your audience to know what is relevant to them  right now ? If you&rsquo;re not listening closely to your current customers and prospects, asking them the right questions and getting to know them as individuals, you&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;tweeting to the wind.&rdquo; The only way to stay relevant is to shut up and listen, and no automation tool is better than manually visiting the social profiles of your customers and listening to their conversations to get a sense of what they&rsquo;re all about. Do the work&mdash;and scale it by having your employees do the same.</li><li> <strong>  Demeanor: </strong>  How do you come across to your audience? Are your interactions friendly, helpful, gracious and authentic, or do they suggest you&rsquo;re tired, annoyed or not being genuine? Just because a conversation is happening on digital channels doesn&rsquo;t mean you can disrespect people, be impolite or rude. Would you dare to treat a customer as a second-class citizen in a face-to-face conversation? Of course not! When in doubt, just be nice. Remember, people are watching how you treat others online. <br/>  </li><p> Every one of these areas is important because a positive Social ID fuels positive word of mouth and creates brand advocates. What value are you providing for those with whom you interact? Think about it carefully and put yourself in your audience&rsquo;s shoes. Changing your perspective will help you make the changes you need so your Social ID works for you, not against you.</p><p> <strong>  Shift Your Thinking </strong></p><p> Developing your Social ID requires a basic shift in thinking, from an advertising mindset to one of bringing value to your customers. Don&rsquo;t keep pitching them with sales messages&mdash;provide them with rich content and authentic interaction instead.</p><p> People just want to be treated like people, not targets. Companies that get this right are constantly striving to be more customer-centric. They wrap social around all their business processes instead of just using it as a marketing platform. That kind of thinking is essential because you can no longer control the conversation. It&rsquo;s how you act, rather than what you look like, that influences how people feel about your brand, so forward-thinking companies are always engaging with the customer. They concentrate on building relationships and trust rather than &ldquo;branding themselves&rdquo; on social channels.</p><p> <strong>  Consistent Customer Experience Is Key </strong></p><p> How you act, what you share, and how you treat people on social channels is critical to developing a positive Social ID, but if I were to have to sum it all up in one phrase, that phrase would be &ldquo;customer experience.&rdquo; Providing great customer experiences results in &ldquo;super&rdquo; fans or brand evangelists who shout your praises to everyone they know. People don&rsquo;t become brand advocates because they like your logo. They become advocates when they receive consistently great experiences every time you connect with them.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s world, the phrase &ldquo;your reputation precedes you&rdquo; can be good or it can be bad. Make sure it&rsquo;s good by concentrating on listening, being responsive, giving value and being nice to people. A brand is what a business does; a reputation is what people remember and share. Deliver positive customer experiences at every opportunity, and you can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p>",

    "content": "<p> An investment policy should help guide the investment decisions of you and your advisor. Those decisions should be for your best interests. Investment policy statements are common place with institutional investing. If investment policy statements are good for them why not for you?</p><p> <strong>  Investing without an investment policy </strong></p><p> I find that at the beginning of an investment voyage many people are focused on investment returns. Some brokers prey on that expectation promising high returns. They further say that they have some secret sauce for picking investments. For some, this means trying to jump in and out of the market at the right time to constantly see an increase in the return. In fact some financial professionals like to tell you about the previous history of an investment they are recommending. However, many financial professionals omit the conversation on the bumpiness of the ride required to achieve the returns. In some cases the returns were based purely on luck. A portfolio design may have simply been created by using the benefit of hindsight. Historically, that approach has not created consistent results.</p><p> Chuck Self, Chief Investment Officer of iSectors, says that people want a &ldquo;predictable pattern of returns&rdquo; and need an allocation strategy that has the ability to deliver on that desire. I believe that the job of an investment advisor1, is to help you choose an allocation strategy that:</p><li> Is consistent with your goal and time-frame, has a pattern of returns frame based on the strategy&rsquo;s longevity and historical risk and return results throughout the life of the strategy;</li><li> Has downside risk that allows you to stay invested at all times; and</li><li> Has a strong possibility to repeat the pattern of potential returns in the future. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  What is an investment policy statement? </strong></p><p> Think of an investment policy statement as guidance for the decisions that determine your portfolio. The Center for Fiduciary Studies considers the following variables important decision factors, Time Horizon, Risk Tolerance, Expected Return, Asset Class Preference and Tax status.</p><p> You may equate this approach to having a boutique store. What should the store sell? Shouldn&rsquo;t sell hats or hardware for example. If it sells hardware what kind of hardware should sell? Should be high service in a few items or low service in many items? From an investment perspective:</p><li> What is the purpose of the money that&rsquo;s being invested?</li><li> How much money needs to be accumulated?</li><li> When is the money needed?</li><li> Might there be some cash needs along the way?</li><li> Are there any types of investments that should be avoided?</li><li> Are there a preferred types of investments such as sustainable?</li><li> Do you have issues with international investing which involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and political instability or are you concerned about investing in small companies you&rsquo;ve never heard of that may be more volatile than large companies? <br/>  </li><p> There may be areas where you don&rsquo;t have concern. However is it wise to give your financial professional carte blanche to invest in anything? What risk tolerance are you comfortable with regarding this money? While you may have an aggressive risk tolerance, if you need the money soon, it may not be wise to be aggressive as defined by being at all stocks.</p><p> <strong>  An investment policy statement is a guidebook to be revised </strong></p><p> I was introduced to modern finance at the MIT Sloan School of management. It boasts several of the Nobel Prize winning economists along with the University of Chicago who have tried to make sense out of the investment markets going back to 1926 and in some cases beyond. Different stocks exhibit generally the same behavior and can be grouped in asset classes. Much research goes into looking at this by various academics and research firms. Harry Markowitz, a Nobel Prize winner, gets the credit for thinking that by simply taking stocks and bonds and mixing them in different proportions to create a pattern of portfolios. He found that by forming all of the combinations of 100% bond to 100% stocks you could create what he called an efficient frontier. However, that doesn&rsquo;t hold for all periods. Historically, it has done so for periods of ten plus years. Educating and managing your expectations is critical to your success.</p><p> I also like to see what the California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS) is doing. CalPERS has revised its viewpoint on the markets over the last few years favoring using so called passive investments to implement its portfolio requiring a revision to its investment policy statement. Recently it&rsquo;s also done so deciding to get rid of hedge funds. Should you consider doing the same?</p><p> <strong>  Do you need an investment policy statement? </strong></p><p> I believe you absolutely do. In fact you deserve it. These are not necessarily simple documents that you can find a template to download. There are many assumptions that you can make. I believe it important to find an investment advisor who can question your own assumptions even if you decide to implement the policy yourself.</p><p> You can also choose to work with an Accredited Investment Fiduciary or Certified Financial Planner&trade; professional to develop a unique investment policy statement tailored to your specific financial goals. They could then help you with the selection and monitoring and replacement of your investments. This approach helps align your expectations of risk adjusted returns with your advisor&rsquo;s. Would you like to pursue a structured systematic approach?. Learn one option here.</p><p> 1I refer to the investment adviser representatives and Registered Investment Advisors that are regulated by the SEC. These advisors are bound by law to act in their client&rsquo; best interest.</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When working with companies that want more from their marketing, the first thing I ask to see is the plan. Why? I want to see what they are trying to accomplish&hellip; it is that simple. <br/> <br/> <strong>  You need to know why you are doing something before you do it. </strong></p><p> The hardest part is to truly quantify the &ldquo;why&rdquo; in any marketing plan. Being a process, metric, and sales driven marketer, I find myself always asking the question &ldquo;So what is all of this going to do for me?&rdquo; and more often than not, getting blank stares back.</p><p> After working with companies of all sizes, I have found the companies consistently hitting sales goals from marketing programs have one thing in common &ndash; a demand generation plan. The reason comes down to three questions that this process forces you to ask:</p><li> <strong>  What is the measurable goal of what we are trying to do? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How does this drive sales? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do we have what we need in order to execute? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> These questions serve as the backbone to understanding how your programs impact the top line. I can say this from first hand knowledge: If you can&rsquo;t answer these questions before you start executing marketing programs, then your marketing strategy is actually just hope, wrapped in a beautiful powerpoint.</p><p> Here is why these questions are so important:</p><p> <strong>  1) You have accountability for a number&hellip; much like a sales rep. </strong></p><p> Whether or not you hit it is another story, just having the accountability is a monumental behavior change for most marketing departments. When you have a number, &ldquo;nice-to-haves&rdquo; are moved aside for &ldquo;must-haves&rdquo; and execution is a top priority. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2) You get a fundamental understanding of the marketing and sales process. </strong> <br/> <br/> By knowing how leads come into the system, move to opportunities, and then are closed by sales reps, your mindset will change&hellip; I can almost guarantee it. I have seen this change entire quarterly plans from top-of-funnel initiatives to move-the-pipe strategies once the data was in front of the team.</p><p> <strong>  3) You clearly see the gaps BEFORE you start. </strong></p><p> Without fail, every single time I have run this process I find a gap in either the people, platforms, or program dollars needed to execute. This is a good thing. Now I can state before we start, &ldquo;Here is what we are going to accomplish, but here is what I need in order to do so.&rdquo;</p><h3> So where do you start?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1) Start from the sale and map out your process by working backwards. </strong> <br/> <br/> Sales &mdash;&gt; Opportunities &mdash;&gt; Lead / Target</p><p> Make sure you map out the different types of sales teams and potential marketing teams involved in handling the leads, opportunities, and sales. It does make a difference.</p><p> <strong>  2) Put numbers to each step. </strong></p><p> I would advise to just take a macro level snapshot for a quarter or two. You will get % conversions between each step (e.g. Lead / Target &mdash;&gt; Opportunity).</p><p> <strong>  3) Apply the numbers forward to your upcoming quarter. </strong></p><p> Put in the upcoming sales target, then work with the % from step 2 backward to get the leads/targets you will need.</p><p> <strong>  4) Determine if your new programs are going to make the cut. </strong></p><p> Can you actually generate the number of leads/targets?</p><p> Should you work on improving conversion rates between the steps?</p><p> Should you work on getting bigger deals into the pipeline?</p><p> This really gives you the true sense of what you need to do because you now have a much more concrete &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind it.</p><p> <strong>  You can make this process as complicated as you want, but my recommendation is to start simple. It can overwhelm you quickly if you get too deep too quickly. Remember, the goal of this part of the process is to see if your programs are actually going to drive sales. So take a realistic view on things to determine if what you are going to do will make the right impact. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> A few days ago,  <u>  <a href=\"http://ghostproxies.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   GhostProxies.com  </a> </u>  came up with an interesting infographic showing some stats on Internet and social-web fakery. <a href=\"https://www.dailyinfographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/How-Many-of-the-Internets-Users-are-Fake1-700x2122.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.dailyinfographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/How-Many-of-the-Internets-Users-are-Fake1-700x2122.jpg \"/> </a> The old metaphor for the Internet was an information superhighway. Real highways have anywhere from two to a half-dozen or so lanes, so you might assume a superhighway has a few more than that. This was back years ago, though, before the web grew to the juggernaut it is today. The modern superhighway might be millions of lanes, all packed with traffic, people going to and fro at high speeds.Can you imagine the traffic problems on such a highway?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Billions of cars  </a> </u>  traveling at any given time, to and from billions of destinations. One bottleneck, one accident, and you have gridlock for lightyears.The problem isn&rsquo;t helped, either, by the incredible number of these metaphorical cars that don&rsquo;t have drivers. These cars are the fake traffic that spreads around the Internet, coming from a variety of sources. You have your proxy users, people in other cars remote controlling cars so the metaphorical Internet police don&rsquo;t locate the driver. You have your spiders, robot cars with Google Earth cameras strapped to the top, taking surveys of the landmarks they pass. You even have the fake people, cardboard cutouts surrounding the skyscrapers that are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the rest. <strong>  Bots Both Good and Bad </strong> The Internet is just packed full of bots of various kinds, fake users riddle social networks and web forums, bots comment on blog posts anywhere they can. Spiders crawl websites to index them or to look for changes. Malicious spiders look for vulnerabilities or opportunities for spam. &ldquo;Fake&rdquo; traffic comes from proxy URLs, redirects to hide the source of the traffic for good or ill.That&rsquo;s really the question, isn&rsquo;t it? With so much bot traffic flying around and so many fake accounts made, how much of it is valuable? How much of it is dangerous? How much of it do people even realize is going on?Well, we can at least answer the last question. We&rsquo;ve been hard at work compiling statistics about fake users, proxy traffic and web bots, and we have it here for you in convenient infographic form. <strong>  Fake Users </strong> Fake users on websites are admittedly a problem. Facebook, Twitter,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chaos-ensues-as-instagram-deletes-millions-of-accounts-2014-12\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Instagram  </a> </u>  and all the rest fight to combat them, by increasing detection and removing fake users. They try to make it detrimental to accumulate fake users, but there&rsquo;s not a lot they can do to fully fix the problem.What about legitimate fake user accounts? Are there ever legitimate uses for them? I can think of a few. For example, you might want a fake account to test how your page looks from a user&rsquo;s perspective. A Facebook Page Admin, for example, can look at their page, but they still see all of the insights and additional tools available to them. They would need an account without access in order to see how their page truly looks. PHPBB, a forums software, solved this issue by giving admins the ability to view the site from the perspective of any user, so they don&rsquo;t need to create an account specifically for that purpose.Unfortunately, malicious and spam-centric fake users vastly outnumber the few legitimate uses for sock puppet accounts. It&rsquo;s for reasons like this that some Asian games and social networks require valid national identity numbers to register. <strong>  Proxy Traffic </strong> Proxy traffic, likewise, can be used for good and ill. Some people use proxies to get around IP blocks on forums and in games, or to make it look like their posts &ndash; possibly spam posts &ndash; come from a different location so they can&rsquo;t be blocked easily. Proxies are even used to hide the source of hacks and DDoS attacks.On the other hand, proxy traffic can be useful to test geolocation services, or to get around certain tracking and privacy invasion software. Privacy is a huge issue on the Internet today, <strong>  Web Crawlers </strong> Web spiders, of course, are the bread and butter of many online services. Any search engine either uses their own fleet of web drones, or they borrow their index from another engine that does. It&rsquo;s not only a legitimate use, it&rsquo;s a necessary one, if we want such services to remain functional. The Internet is so large and changes so often that it would be impossible to keep up with it in any other way.On the other hand, you also have malicious web crawlers. You have crawlers that ignore search engine directives to index pages that otherwise would remain invisible to the public. You have crawlers that search for comment fields or contact lists to submit their advertising through, which are the front line soldiers in the Captcha wars. You have similar bots designed to create fake accounts on forums, blogs and social networks, for use in creating fake accounts. There are bots that steal content, bots that look for outdated software with known vulnerabilities,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.incapsula.com/blog/bot-traffic-report-2013.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   and more  </a> </u> .No one can say that these malicious bots are anything other than a problem, but there&rsquo;s no good way to block bot traffic without blocking the beneficial traffic as well, at least not on an Internet-wide basis. Perhaps the first step to a better solution, at least, is an awareness of the scale of the problem.</p>",

I will call back at such a such time (the earlier the morning the better) </li><li> <strong>  Script Option: If I am calling you and you are not the appropriate person I should be speaking to, </strong> I would appreciate if (i.e. your assistant) or you get back to me with the appropriate person's name (I've done this, and then it looks like you've been referred top-down)</li><li> <strong>  ALWAYS have a reason for your call </strong> and a reason WHY they should talk to you</li><li> <strong>  Research: The best time to call a prospect is between 8:30-10:30 a.m. </strong> yet most people believe it is just after lunch (which is the worst time)</li><li> <strong>  Research: The best day of the week to call someone is a Thursday </strong></li><li> <strong>  If I were to leave you a message saying </strong> I'm calling about life insurance (no, I don't sell that .... but who doesn't get a lot of those calls?) ... you'd automatically delete me ............. but if I were to call you to say I have important ideas on succession planning that have proven successful with other executives like you (specific name dropping is always better) ... would you take that call instead? <br/>  </li><p> If you examine your \"pitch\" you have to be honest with yourself.  Are you saying the exact same thing as anyone else creating noise in your prospect's mind:  I'm better, provide quality, solve the ultimate problems, save money, have deals, better act now, etc. etc. etc.</p><p> You have to develop strong relationships with key decision makers.  If you do, they will want to help you succeed because you've helped them in some way. Go ahead and ask them how many calls they get and which ones they answer and why? <br/> <br/> Many times you will discover that they get a ton of calls/e-mails a day so they all start to sound the same. Yet disciplined decision makers also realize that they can gain the best information from their trusted circle or go to people who will help them solve a problem. They hardly want to pass up an opportunity to learn ways to save money, save time, ease pressure, solve problems. If you can \"hit\" that note in your voicemail or message, you may be more likely to connect. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Here are some ideas to give you incentive to keep plugging:  </strong></p><li> Remember, they're busy. Yes, many are intentionally ignoring you. Many more are simply too busy to answer every call/e-mail they get.</li><li> Remember the executive assistant.  They often are an extension and typically know what hot buttons their boss may react to.  They DO have the power to slam the door, open it up, inform you who may be better suited to address your offer, and schedule appointments.</li><li> Keep in mind, that many decision makers become cynical after dealing with sales people who over promise and under deliver</li><li> Try sending a introductory letter so that you can carefully lay out what it is you are offering, how you've helped others, and when you will call to set up an appointment to share your ideas in depth.  Who gets real mail these days that aren't glossy and scream junk mail anymore?</li><li> Be persistent but classy:  they're counting on you to give up after the first or second call <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Go beyond standard information gathering and persevere by asking more meaty questions: </strong></p><li> Can this person I converse with sign a cheque or contract?</li><li> If not, then who is the decision maker for your services?</li><li> Who can influence the decision maker on your behalf?</li><li> Who are the end users?</li><li> Are their any holes that you can fill that can give you a toe in the door?</li><li> What outside factors influence that decision -- a current contract, established partner, relative who is a vendor or service provider?</li><li> What is greasing the wheels of commerce -- sports or concert tickets? Wining and dining?  Promotional products?</li><li> Do they have a purchasing policy or process that you must follow?</li><li> Are their specific channels that you should go through? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Most professionals who enter the field of sales tend to be more uncomfortable calling on an executive than they are an administrative person.  Many try to snow their managers and executives that have a conversation with just about anyone is a contact.  The truly successful sales professionals know most of this information and more: </strong></p><li> Who their customers are -- what challenges are they facing to serve their own customers?</li><li> What is impacting their industry -- government regulations, ongoing changes, outside influences?</li><li> The history of their purchasing decisions:  who, why and what criteria did they use to establish a relationship with a vendor?</li><li> What knowledge do they need at the table:  being technical is not always the key, asking great questions often leads to better opportunities. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  If you are faced with driving revenue into your organization, it means that you are in the sales game. </strong>  Take pride in understanding what drives customers to your doorstep and what you can do to ensure they stay.  Everyone has a part and a place -- it starts with recognizing that it takes a lot less time and resources to keep a customer happy than it does to find a new one.</p><p> \"Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.\" ~ John D. Rockefeller</p>",

    "content": "<p> I was teaching a speech writing workshop in the DC area, and several participants asked for advice on giving a toast.  Here are some tips:</p><li> <strong>  Keep notes nearby </strong> , so you can refresh your memory in those precious seconds before you begin to speak.  (After all, you&rsquo;ll never get a second chance to give this toast.  Make sure you don&rsquo;t forget to say something important.  It&rsquo;s now or never.)</li><li> <strong>  Stand tall </strong> , with both feet confidently planted &ndash; no rocking from foot to foot, please.  </li><li> <strong>  Make strong eye contact </strong> with the whole audience initially (so everyone feels included).  Then look directly at the person you&rsquo;re toasting.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t start until everyone is quiet. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t mispronounce anyone&rsquo;s name. </strong>  (If you plan to mention the person&rsquo;s spouse or children, be absolutely certain you&rsquo;re saying their names correctly.)</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t confuse your role: </strong> You&rsquo;re giving a toast to honor someone else.  This is not the time to draw attention to yourself or your own achievements.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t attempt contrived humor. </strong> There&rsquo;s nothing worse for a speaker than humor that falls flat &ndash; especially when it falls flat during a toast. (This embarrasses both the speaker and the person being toasted, as well as the entire cringing audience.)</li><p> Enjoy!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisafugere\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Lisa Fugere  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Data is stressful. It&rsquo;s this enormously complex and massive presence that underlies and motivates everything we do, demands our attention at every turn, and asks us to blindly defy our intuition to follow a string of numbers. </strong></p><p> To think that there&rsquo;s a burgeoning crowd of scientists &ndash; some of today&rsquo;s greatest minds &ndash; who&rsquo;ve made it their livelihood to make meaning out of complex data &ndash; is an enormous relief.</p><p> For the sake of a marketing campaign we&rsquo;re running at Radius, I&rsquo;ve spent the past six months learning about this livelihood &shy;&ndash; the growing field of data science, and I&rsquo;ve gained a distinct understanding of what data science is and isn&rsquo;t (for marketers).</p><p> <strong>  1. Growing interest in data science stems from the democratization of data. </strong></p><p> Take a second to think about all the data you could ever collect about your customers. Basic contact info. Social media activity. Web preferences. Interaction with your brand. Millions of data exist about your customers alone, and you can access and track these data in ways you never could before. Ten years ago, you couldn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;this prospect saw my billboard.&rdquo; Today, you can say, &ldquo;this prospect saw my banner ad 4 times, clicked on it after shopping for shoes, visited my website, read a blog article about small business trends, then signed onto Facebook.&rdquo;</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/matt-komorowski-700x394.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p> We track a lot of data, and the cost of storing them has decreased so significantly since the 1980s that big data is accessible to everyone.</p><p> We&rsquo;re all sitting on top of massive datasets, and data scientists will help us make sense of all this data.</p><p> <strong>  2.   Data science isn&rsquo;t alchemy. </strong></p><p> Applying data science to a dataset doesn&rsquo;t instantly enrich it with valuable insights. There&rsquo;s no magic algorithm. No secret sauce. You can&rsquo;t simply hire a data scientist, set them loose on a dataset, and expect gold.</p><p> Expecting a data scientist to pull insights from an unscrubbed dataset is like expecting a sales rep to convert 60%+ leads from an unscrubbed list of event attendees. Data come in all shapes and sizes, and applying any code to a dataset requires a lot of discovering, assessing, shaping, enriching, profiling, and distilling before any analysis happens.</p><p> <strong>  3. Data science is a method, not a job description. </strong></p><p> Where marketers are quick to box data science into a topic category, data scientists vehemently disagree on a clear cut definition of their craft.</p><p> For our upcoming campaign,  <u>  Donut Days </u> , we interviewed a collection of well-respected data scientists about their perception of the field. One of them comes from a finance and biophysics background. One of them is an astrophysicist. Others stem from software engineering and statistics training. They&rsquo;re all data scientists, but on paper, they represent richly diverse histories.</p><p> What to put in a data science job description is one of the largest points of contention within the data science community. There&rsquo;s no formulaic checklist that qualifies someone to be a data scientist; rather, data science is the method a statistician or a programmer or an astrophysicist uses to make sense of big data.</p><p> <strong>  4. Data means nothing until you attach decisions. </strong></p><p> A lot of marketers are interested in data science because they have amassed an enormous dataset to which they need to attach ROI. We hear all the time that we need to become data-driven, but most of us have no idea how. Of the millions of data we could track, which ones do we need to stay on top of?</p><p> I would love to apply data science to my Google Analytics data to discover a magic formula for the perfect piece of content, but this is impossible until I set parameters for perfect content.</p><p> &ldquo;The challenge to your data science team is not to boldly wade into your data and find something interesting. Not so; efforts must be aligned with business goals.&rdquo; <br/> ~Ron Bodkin, Founder &amp; CEO, Think Big Analytics ( <u>  Forbes, 2014 </u> )</p><p> Replacing data with insights is about as helpful as telling you the exact profile of an ideal customer; until you know where to find more similar customers or how best to reach them, you&rsquo;re unlikely to take action. Data science can&rsquo;t help you get from point A to point B with your data until you use it to drive decisions.</p><p> <strong>  5. Through technology, we can all practice data science. </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;re all drowning in data, and we&rsquo;ll soon be drowning in analytics. We can track and analyze everything, and thanks to technology powered by data science, we can transform data and analytics into predictions to drive decisions. Data science will be built into the technology that we use to power our marketing efforts.</p><p> As we explained in  <u>  <a href=\"http://radius.com/2015/03/12/should-you-build-a-data-science-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this blog post  </a> </u> , you probably don&rsquo;t need to build a data science team to take advantage of this new trend. Investing in innovative technologies, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://radius.com/2015/02/05/spark-technology-thats-changing-silicon-valley/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   those powered by Spark  </a> </u> , is a much more manageable goal.</p><p> &ldquo;You personally may never need to upgrade your skills to the level of a professional data scientist. Rather, what you truly need is the ability to tap into continuous, proactive and authoritative insights in all aspects of your life.&rdquo; <br/> ~James Kobielus, Big Data Evangelist, IBM ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/why-you-may-never-need-become-data-scientist\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IBM Big Data Hub, 2015  </a> </u> )</p>",

    "link": "10-ways-you-can-start-socialselling-that-dont-take-a-lot-of-time",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> The number one objection I get from Sales People about Social Selling is &ldquo;Tim, with all the other pressures I have, I just don&rsquo;t have time for this.&rdquo;</strong>While I can give many arguments about changing your priorities, new ways of working, etc etc. Here are some ways you can short cut the time you spend on Social Media. Of course, don&rsquo;t expect the same results, but it might get you into a Social Selling habit.A member of my family, who is not a big reader, once asked me, what books should I read to get me into the reading habit. My advice was to start with magazines, start in small chunks then to move onto a Harry Potter or Dan Brown book. George Orwell, (as one person suggested) might not be the best place for her to start.<strong> This blog is about how a new starter can start the Social Selling journey.</strong>If you are a purest or a long time Social Seller stop reading now this isn&rsquo;t for you. In addition, thsi won&rsquo;t get you thousands of followers but let&rsquo;s get in to the habit first.First things first. There are many Social Networks but unless you have a particular reason to get into YouTube, Pinterest then as a B2B sales person I would focus on LinkedIn and Twitter.How often should I post? At least once a day. You can post the same content on LinkedIn as well as Twitter.  <strong> Here are the ten things you can do to Hustle your Social Selling:</strong>1.<strong> When you get into work in the morning and you get your laptop / Mac out, post something to Twitter and LinkedIn.</strong>There must be something you read in the paper on the train on the way in or came in on email overnight.<strong> 2. Use automation.</strong>If you have read my post <a href=\"https://timothyhughesuk.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/why-dont-we-just-automate-social-media-we-can-then-go-back-to-doing-our-day-jobs-custexp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo; <u>  Why don&rsquo;t we just automate Social Media, we can then go back to doing our day jobs </u> &rdquo; </a> you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m not a big fan of automation but <a href=\"https://bufferapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Buffer</a> and <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Hootsuite</a> can be used to help you &ldquo;batch&rdquo; up a bunch of tweets in advance.  When you get in the office in the morning, why not batch some Tweets or LinkedIn posts?<strong> 3. Work as a Team.</strong>In all of the presentations I&rsquo;ve seen on Social Selling, Social Media is positioned as a solo effort. Rather than searching for content, why not retweet others?  Form a team with work colleagues and agree to retweet each other or like posts on LinkedIn.  Don&rsquo;t expect an explosion of followers, but you will start building a presence and (hopefully) start getting into the habit.<strong> 4. Your Marketing department should be providing you with content.</strong>Agree, in many cases this can look very &ldquo;corporate&rdquo;, but using tools discussed in 2. You can batch this up and schedule a number posts.  Check out the <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jon-miller/the-411-rule-of-marketing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 4.1.1 Rule</a>.<strong> 5. Reuse content.</strong>Why not use meeting notes to create Points of View (POV) LinkedIn / Blog posts. &ldquo;These are the top 5 issues we see in Accounting systems in Media today&rdquo; for example.<strong> 6. Take corporate videos, events, areas that interest you and write a LinkedIn post.</strong>5 lines of introduction and context and then post the video / link to the event. Not the most elegant way of working but it gets you started.<strong> 7. What is your passion?</strong>Ask anybody about their passion and their eyes light up and immediately they become positively animated. Why start blogging about serious subjects, why not start with your passion? Sailing, Photography, etc<strong> 8. Download a content curation tool like  <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Flipboard </a>  or </strong><a href=\"https://klout.com/home?next=/measure\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>  Klout </strong>  </a>and find content, there must be time waiting in reception at a customer or on the train where you could find something relevant to Tweet?<strong> 9. Create a list on Twitter</strong>of Influencers or subscribe to one of my lists and as mentioned in 3. retweet that content.<strong> 10. Stop being a corporate suit and be human.</strong>OK, so it&rsquo;s a terrible clique but why not post a photo of your lunch / dog walk / airport lounge you are sitting in? In her book<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SOCIAL-EXECUTIVE-MASTER-MEDIA-BUSINESS/dp/0730312895\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo;Social Executive Dionne Lew </a>says &hellip;.. &ldquo;Why not take a photo and post it, show your human side.&rdquo;Finally I often get asked how much time should I spend on Social Media?  In my view, the world has changed and this requires us to change with it.  On that basis, 30 mins a day would be a good target.<strong> Yes this is a lot of time, but what worked 20 years ago might not work now.</strong>Many Sales people I talk to work out what old ways they need to drop and find time for the working practices of the 21st century.If during your journey you come up with other ideas that can help Social Sellers out there, I would love to hear from you. Please send suggestions.",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As the financial industry advances in technology to increase efficiency and enhance client service, firms face a daunting risk of increased exposure to cybersecurity threats and attacks. The changes in how firms and clients use and interact through technology create a variety of new avenues for intrusion that must be proactively addressed.</p><p> Earlier this year FINRA issued its  <u>  <a href=\"/category/fintech-center/cybersecurity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Report on Cybersecurity Practices  </a> </u> , which suggests using a risk management method to cybersecurity, while noting there isn&rsquo;t a one-size-fits-all method. The report reviews the results of an industry-wide cybersecurity examination and emphasizes the importance of protecting both investor and firm data. In addition, FINRA outlines effective practices to assist firms with their cybersecurity efforts by determining vulnerabilities in existing systems and analyzing and creating processes to manage risk.</p><p> Due to a consistent rise in the number of cybersecurity breaches taking place, advisors need to incorporate security management into their daily practice and ensure everything is being done to protect client and firm data. FINRA&rsquo;s report provides a list of principles and best practices to guide advisors on cybersecurity and highlights eight key areas:</p><p> <strong>  Leadership </strong></p><p> Senior-level management and board of director engagement and knowledge regarding cybersecurity issues is essential to the framework and success of your firm&rsquo;s cybersecurity process. Involvement and commitment from leadership is critical for firms to achieve cybersecurity goals.</p><p> <strong>  Risk Assessments </strong></p><p> Every firm faces cybersecurity risk, no matter the size or business model. To understand your risk, be proactive by completing regularly scheduled risk assessments to identify both external and internal areas of vulnerability. If you don&rsquo;t know if your system is flawless, a risk assessment is crucial.</p><p> <strong>  Technical Controls </strong></p><p> Multiple security controls need to be implemented to protect software and hardware that stores and processes data. Select controls that are appropriate to your technology platform through identity and access management, data encryption, and penetration testing.</p><p> <strong>  Response Plans </strong></p><p> FINRA recommends that firms establish policies and procedures, assign roles and responsibilities, and test incident plans for responding to cybersecurity occurrences. FINRA also notes that while it is impossible to address every type of attack, a response plan should outline processes for several different scenarios.</p><p> <strong>  Vendor Relationship Management </strong></p><p> Cybersecurity risk that could arise from third-party service providers must be managed by performing due diligence throughout the relationship cycle. Utilize contractual agreements to establish processes for vendors who have access to sensitive data, client information, or firm systems. In addition, develop terms based on the sensitivity level of information the vendor has access.</p><p> <strong>  Staff Training </strong></p><p> Define cybersecurity training needs, training cycles, and deliver training to all team members based on your firm&rsquo;s specific points of exposure. Each employee should have a full understanding of your risk assessment process, threat intelligence research, and the proper incident reporting procedures in the event a device is compromised or infected.</p><p> <strong>  Increase Cyber Threat Intelligence  </strong></p><p> Assign responsibility for cybersecurity intelligence gathering and analysis. The collected data should then be utilized to recognize, discover, and respond to cybersecurity threats. Your firm should also implement an information sharing process to proactively secure measures that reduce security weaknesses and improve their ability to protect data.</p><p> <strong>  Insurance Coverage </strong></p><p> Evaluate insurance coverage for cybersecurity-related events and pay close attention to policy coverages and exclusions. If you hold a cyber-insurance policy, conduct a periodic analysis to review the adequacy of coverage and the ability to reduce the potential impact to your financial statement in the event of an attack.</p><p> <strong>  The Bottom Line </strong></p><p> FINRA stated that the report does not create new legal requirements and included the following statement:</p><p> &ldquo;FINRA expects firms to consider the principles and effective practices presented in this report as they develop or enhance their cybersecurity programs. FINRA will assess the adequacy of firms&rsquo; cybersecurity programs in light of the risks they face. This report is not intended to express any legal position, and does not create any new legal requirements or change any existing regulatory obligations.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Financial advisors are taking cybersecurity seriously by implementing programs and procedures and analyzing systems to ensure that client and firm data is secure and well protected from lurking hackers. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> If you turn on the news or pickup the latest edition of the newspaper, it is very easy to become jaded with people in general simply because unfortunately, media has a tendency to only focus on the negative. So it is not surprising when that same negative thinking enters the workplace.</p><p> As such, scrutinization of employee behavior, performance, attitude, and engagement is at an all time high; the focus on people has been lost in the intertwines of schoolyard pettiness by both leaders and even HR. Instead, the focus has become simply about what someone is not doing or why they are pushing back.</p><p> <strong>  While the bounds of employee pushback has increased over the years, I also point out that leadership guidance, support, and ability to manage situations has subsequently decreased. </strong> Therefore resulting in many managers and even HR professionals doing one or several of the following:</p><li> Passing off employee issues to HR or someone else to handle;</li><li> Ignoring the situation completely;</li><li> Focusing immediately on dismissal because the level of frustration has reached an all time high <br/>  </li><p> With any situation, accountability is key. It all starts here and by defining clear expectations and managing those expectations, it can be easier to avoid the schoolyard brawl situations. However, before it even begins with defining expectations, it starts with treating people like people.</p><p> Sure, it is easy to simply treat people like cogs on a manufacturing line with no emotions, but that honestly will not yield anything. People must feel valued, appreciated, and have an opportunity to be understood (even if it isn&rsquo;t always right). And this all begins with communication. True face-to-face communication&hellip;.not an email, IM, or text message.</p><p> Having dialogue with someone can tell you a lot about what they are experiencing. It is the tone, inflection, and non-verbals that tell you more than the words they are saying. You certainly cannot get this through an email, IM, or text message. Which is why it is ever important to have this dialogue when something concerning occurs.</p><p> For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a handful of employees come to you and state their manager is creating a hostile, intimidating, and threatening work environment. Because much of thinking today is jaded with regard to people, one might immediately think the manager is guilty of the actions and want to move for dismissal (all without ever speaking to the person). However, this is where conversations are still ever so important. There are always two sides to every story &ndash; we just have to be quick to remember that instead of thinking the one side is correct.</p><p> Having the conversation with the manager who is claimed to have created a threatening, intimidating, and harassing environment may reveal to you they are not. Instead, the context of their words or the way they are speaking could be interpreted or perceived incorrectly. Which can be resolved through coaching, feedback, and development &ndash; not termination. But without the conversation with this manager, this interpretation or perception would have been lost on the situation. Therefore resulting in termination of the manager in true error.</p><p> Situations as that above happen every day. And it is situations like these that I believe can assist us remember some valuable lessons when it comes to dealing with people:</p><li> <strong>  Remember people are people; they are not cogs or machines. </strong> They have feelings, emotions and want to be heard and valued.</li><li> <strong>  Conversations are ever so impactful. </strong> A conversation alone can brighten someone&rsquo;s day by providing guidance, words of encouragement, or a different way to see something. Conversations create a dynamic environment to produce truly great things.</li><li> <strong>  Take time to react. </strong> A reaction to a comment or something someone does doesn&rsquo;t warrant the first thing that comes to mind. Instead, take a moment to reflect and analyze to ensure your reply has meaning, provides value, and can make the situation move forward.</li><li> <strong>  Not everyone is acting with malicious intent. </strong> While I understand it is easy to become jaded today, not everyone has the intent to act maliciously. Some instances are that where people really did not know. They haven&rsquo;t taught, trained, developed, or perhaps they didn&rsquo;t realize. Guide these situations to make people better.</li>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There are six levels of professional relationships that you should be naturally moving your clients through.</p><p> The first two are pre-client:</p><p> <strong>  Level 1: Contact  </strong></p><p> This is the starting point. We meet someone, have a brief conversation, and exchange business cards. We may stay in touch over the years, but there is little interaction. The individual is primarily just a name in our contact database.</p><p> <strong>  Level 2: Acquaintance </strong></p><p> Acquaintances are contacts whom we have gotten to know a bit better, or friends we have carried with us through the different stages of our lives. We know something about each other, and may have actually spent a fair amount of time together; but the individual has never become a client. They may be important to us for other reasons, however; perhaps as source of friendship, information, and insight about markets and competitors, or as resources that we can introduce to our clients.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Client-Growth-Matrix-for-Blog.png\"/></p><p> The next four are levels of client relationships:</p><p> <strong>  Level 3: Expert </strong></p><p> At the beginning of your relationships with them, some contacts and acquaintances become clients for whom you are invariably hired in a narrow, expert role. The client has a problem she wants solved, and you have the specific knowledge and experience to deal with it. Almost all relationships begin in this way. At this stage, the trust and mutual understanding that enable a relationship to deepen simply have not developed yet.</p><p> <strong>  Level 4: Vendor or Steady Supplier </strong></p><p> If you do a good job on the first engagement or transaction, you will probably be asked to supply more of your products and services. Don&rsquo;t kid yourself, however&mdash;you&rsquo;re still in &ldquo;request-for-proposal territory,&rdquo; just as you were when you were a solitary expert for hire. At this point, you may be spending a lot of your time with procurement managers or lower-level buyers, without the benefit of having an anchor into senior management. You are by no means part of this client&rsquo;s inner circle; you&rsquo;re more like a contractor who is managing many tradesmen or experts.</p><p> <strong>  Level 5: Trusted Advisor </strong></p><p> You earn this coveted role&mdash;which was the subject of my first book,  Clients For Life &mdash;by exemplifying a series of essential qualities that set you apart from the expert for hire or vendor. These include things like personal trustworthiness, independence, judgment, big-picture thinking, empathy, and others. You are now an agenda setter&mdash;someone who understands, is aligned with, and is helping to shape and improve your client&rsquo;s agenda of critical priorities and goals.  You&rsquo;ll also experience great personal satisfaction in the role of a trusted counselor who is having a significant impact on client success.</p><p> <strong>  Level 6: Trusted Partner </strong></p><p> This is the ultimate goal, especially for a firm: to be a trusted advisor to your client and to harness the full power of your organization to address a variety of client issues. Finding yourself in this quadrant means that you have built a true partnership. You are helping to shape your client&rsquo;s agenda, you&rsquo;ve developed many-to-many relationships, and you are meeting an array of client needs with different services or products. It&rsquo;s not an easy task to play this role with a client, but if you succeed, you and your firm will probably have a client for life&mdash;and a highly profitable one at that.</p><p> Level 5 and Level 6 client relationships will contribute a disproportionately high percentage of your growth, revenue, profits, and intellectual capital development. They are where you will often have your greatest impact. Not every client will reach these levels. But when they do, your personal satisfaction&mdash;and not just your income statement&mdash;will dramatically grow.</p><p> Where are your clients in the Client Growth Matrix? What strategies have helped you evolve your relationships through these stages?</p>",

    "title": "Achieving Balance: How to Get Busy & Stay Sane",
    "link": "achieving-balance-how-to-get-busy-stay-sane",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  As every entrepreneur, mother, or human being knows- sometimes shit hits the fan. </strong></p><p> Sometimes you get so busy that by the time you stop to check in with yourself, you realize the time for preemptive self-care has already passed and you&rsquo;re in the danger zone. That point where you need an electronic power-down, a beach, and/or a beverage served in a coconut.</p><p> At that point, the concept of balance seems like an unattainable dream.</p><p> For years, I vacillated between the two extremes: periods of intense busyness followed by a sudden crash. It felt like a hangover and was about as enjoyable as one. When I started my business and decided to pursue another degree, I knew I had no choice but to master the concept of balance.</p><p> So today, I&rsquo;m sharing my formula for finding balance. The tools I use to stay productive and maintain my sanity:</p><p> <strong>  1. I Only Schedule 1/3 Of My Time. </strong></p><p> At first glance, this may seem impossible. I refer to &ldquo;schedule&rdquo; as commitments I&rsquo;ve made to others. This includes client time, meetings, or time with friends. Anything where I&rsquo;m accountable and need to physically show up. Much of my work is done below the surface. I find that I can&rsquo;t truly serve or produce my best work if I&rsquo;m filling my time with false-notions of what a workday &ldquo;should&rdquo; look like. The truth is that planning, writing, and listening to my own voice are more fruitful than clocking in hours in front of my laptop.</p><p> <strong>  2. I Define Success On My Own Terms. </strong></p><p> Like many New Yorkers, I thought:</p><li> busyness = success</li><li> hustling = success</li><li> working hard = success</li><p> Because of that, I&rsquo;d often find myself saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to opportunities that weren&rsquo;t a good fit. I&rsquo;d take on too much, then blame myself when I inevitably crashed. After a few cycles of this, I began wondering why I kept choosing to self-sabotage. I stripped away all expectations I had placed on myself based on false notions of success. It was then that I found a new freedom to create what I truly wanted. Only then was I able to accept myself and create real success.</p><p> <strong>  3. I Dared To Be Different. </strong></p><p> In any career where you create your own path, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get intimidated. As a highly sensitive person, this was a real struggle for me. I looked to others in my field and internalized the idea that their ways must be the right ways. Needless to say, that idea held me back from creating what I wanted, being happy, and tapping into my ability to serve. The writer Thomas Moore once said \"The need to be normal is the predominant anxiety disorder in modern life.\" So, I&rsquo;ve given up on trying to be normal at all. Aspiring to something greater is scary. Fear floods in. But that openness allowed me to grow. The key to embracing your full potential is letting go of your limiting beliefs. </p><p> <strong>  4. I Ask For Help. </strong></p><p> No one has all of the answers all of the time. So why keep trying? The desire to seem like I had everything figured out is exactly what kept me from figuring anything out. I created a support system of people who inspire, motivate, and challenge me. No, it&rsquo;s not always my family. Yes, some of them are paid professionals. Asking for help is an act of bravery, humility, and strength. </p><p> <strong>  5. I Give &amp; Receive. </strong></p><p> There is more than enough to go around, yet most of us focus solely on giving OR receiving. The key to balance is flowing between the two. When I&rsquo;d only give, I felt drained, resentful, and in lack. When I&rsquo;d only take, I felt unfulfilled and didn&rsquo;t enjoy what I already had. True balance comes from fearlessly giving as you&rsquo;re guided and then receiving with gratitude.</p><p> <strong>  6. I Work For It. </strong></p><p> In the past, as soon as I&rsquo;d start to feel energized, happy, and successful, I&rsquo;d get a little lazy and tell myself, \"I'm feeling great! I guess I can stop eating well/exercising/meditating.\" And then things fell apart and the cycle would begin again. I now actively maintain the self-care practices that keep me whole and happy. For me, 8 hours of sleep isn&rsquo;t a luxury, it&rsquo;s a necessity. When people ask me how I got to be so happy, I say the same thing every time, \"I work for it. Every. Single. Day.\" It's a conscious choice.</p><p> <strong>  THE TAKEAWAY: </strong></p><p> Productivity doesn&rsquo;t have to come at the cost of your sanity. Defining success on your own terms allows you to ignore the standard one-size-fits all approach and live from a place of truth and knowing. It allows you to embrace your genius instead of hiding from it. Choosing how to spend your time isn&rsquo;t easy, there are always challenges along the way. But each moment I spend wavering from one extreme to another is another moment I neglect to use my personal power. And ultimately, isn&rsquo;t that what productivity and success are all about?</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  More of my clients have started to ask the following questions: If I were to die tomorrow, who would inherit my estate, assets, properties, businesses and belongings? </strong> Should I save and spend frugally so my beneficiaries receive the maximum possible inheritance from my wealth? Or, should I consider spending it and not leaving much behind at all? </p><p> Former front man of the band  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police\" target=\"_blank\">   The Police  </a> </u>  and globally renowned solo artist Sting plans on doing just that. The 62 year old singer has amassed a fortune in excess of $300 million. And although he has six children ranging in age from 18 to 37, he  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101781286\" target=\"_blank\">   does not intend  </a> </u>  to save his earnings just so they&rsquo;ll have a financial net to fall into. In fact, he says he and his wife plan to spend most, if not all of it.  </p><p> Bizarre as it may seem to many parents, Sting&rsquo;s reluctance to leave considerable wealth to his children is actually becoming a common trend among the rich and famous. However, this is also the mentality that Sting&rsquo;s children have grown up with all their lives. </p><p> Yet one has to wonder &mdash; is such behavior beneficial to children in the long run? Does it actually help them become productive members of society and prevent them from turning into spoiled, incompetent do-nothings? Sting explains that his children rarely ask him for financial help and that he has always encouraged them to earn their own incomes. </p><p> <strong>  When debating whether to leave a significant fortune to your own children, consider the following points:  </strong></p><li> <p>  <strong>   No estate means no financial disputes  </strong>   &mdash; In a perfect world, beneficiaries would happily accept the last wishes of the deceased. Unfortunately, especially where large and complex estates are concerned, loved ones often end up squabbling with each other over details or   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/will_contest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    contesting the will&rsquo;s validity   </a>  </u>   Perhaps Sting believes that by leaving little money behind, he&rsquo;ll prevent financial disputes over his wealth after he dies. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   There is a responsible way to leave behind a fortune  </strong>   &mdash; Completely disinheriting your children may not be your cup of tea. Nor may be intentionally depleting your funds. Fear not &mdash; your desire to leave your assets to your children is perfectly normal. Even if you are very wealthy, you may still be able to provide ample inheritance without it affecting their character. While your children may know they have a multi-million trust fund to fall back on when they get older, you can instill in them strong values and an understanding of financial responsibility at an early age.  </p></li><p> Sting&rsquo;s decision to spend most of his money may seem foolish, or even downright cruel toward his children. However, the  <u>  Fields of Gold </u>  singer is determined to prevent them from becoming typical trust fund babies. As you consider your  <a href=\"http://www.bmcestateplanning.com/estate-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  estate planning </a>  options in Union County, NJ, and how your choices may affect your loved ones, remember to consult an experienced attorney before making any final decisions. </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Parents have spoken: paying for college is affecting their retirement planning. </strong></p><p> Two new surveys indicate that the surge in college costs is impinging on Americans&rsquo; retirement finances.  One survey, by the research firm Hearts &amp; Wallets, found that boomer parents who support their adult children are more likely to delay retirement than parents of financially independent offspring.  The second survey, by the mutual fund manager  <u>  <a href=\"http://corporate.troweprice.com/ccw/home/pressReleases/pressRelease.do?pressRelease=/html/content/home/pressReleases/pressReleaseContent/03052015.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   T.

    "content": "<p> Preparing for parenthood? When you&rsquo;re expecting a baby, it&rsquo;s easy to focus on the excitement and joy caused by your growing family. But don&rsquo;t get too caught up in decorating the nursery just yet.</p><p> Getting ready for your new arrival involves a number of practical steps to take &ndash; and that includes taking a look at things like insurance. Having a baby is a huge medical and financial event, and it pays to be informed about your insurance options.</p><h3> Understand Your Company&rsquo;s Parental Benefits</h3><p> <br/> If you work outside the home and intend to return to your job after the birth, you&rsquo;ll need to understand your company&rsquo;s parental leave policy. You also need to know what  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   benefits your employer offers  </a> </u>  new parents.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve worked for your company for over a year and the company has 50 or more employees, the Family and Medical Leave Act applies to you.</p><p> The FMLA dictates that parents (both men and women) are allowed 12 weeks of unpaid family leave after the birth or adoption of a child. Your employer must also pay their usual contribution to your health care costs during your leave.</p><p> There are a few exceptions: your employer can deny this leave if you&rsquo;re in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/4-steps-for-negotiating-your-next-pay-raise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   top 10% of wage earners  </a> </u>  at the company, and the company can prove that your absence would substantially harm the business.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll also want to check with your company to see if you are covered by short-term disability insurance. Birth mothers are entitled to short-term disability income if the company pays disability benefits in other circumstances.</p><p> If your employer doesn&rsquo;t provide short-term disability insurance, you might be able to obtain independent  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/disability-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   disability insurance  </a> </u> . Most companies do require some time between starting a policy and getting pregnant.</p><p> Many employers provide more leave and more pay than that offered by the FMLA, so make sure to check in with HR to get the full scoop. At a minimum, you must notify your employer thirty days before taking time off under FMLA.</p><h3> Learn the Ins and Outs of Your Medical Insurance</h3><p> <br/> With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, the vast majority  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/hsas-and-fsas-and-healthcare-costs-oh-my/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   health insurance plans  </a> </u>  cover pregnancy and childbirth. This is true even if you become pregnant before your coverage begins.</p><p> You can change plans mid-pregnancy if you don&rsquo;t like your health insurance plan, but there are usually specific open enrollment periods.</p><p> The only exceptions are a few grandfathered individual health plans &mdash; plans bought individually, not through an employer. If you are on a grandfathered plan, you&rsquo;ll have to investigate their maternity benefits to understand your options.</p><p> Pregnancy must be treated as any other medical condition, but the specific details of your policy will determine your out-of-pocket expenses.</p><p> Make sure you understand your deductible and copayments to estimate your costs. Check with your insurance company to understand your options with prenatal tests, prenatal care, birth settings, labor support, breast feeding support, and neo-natal care.</p><p> Now that you understand your medical benefits during pregnancy, you&rsquo;ll also want to make sure  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/planning-essentials-for-expectant-and-new-parents/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your child is covered  </a> </u>  after birth.</p><p> Having a baby qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). You can enroll or change your health insurance coverage even if it&rsquo;s outside the open enrollment period. The coverage can be effective as of the baby&rsquo;s birth date.</p><h3> Provide for Your Family with Disability Insurance</h3><p> <br/> Now that you have a child that depends on you financially, you might want to consider long-term disability insurance.</p><p> Over 25% of Americans will be considered disabled for some period of time before reaching retirement age. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that those family members earning an income protect their ability to work and earn an income for your family with long-term disability insurance.</p><h3> Safeguard Your Family with Life Insurance</h3><p> <br/> No one likes to think about worst-case scenarios. If you feel talking about  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/5-signs-you-may-need-a-financial-planner/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the need for life insurance  </a> </u>  is too morbid during this happy time, flip your mindset. Remind yourself that taking out the right coverage is to protect your child no matter what happens.</p><p> Term life insurance is the most cost-effective option and you&rsquo;ll want insurance for both parents. Even stay-at-home moms and dads need life insurance &ndash; if something happens to a stay-at-home parent, a working parent will need additional childcare support.</p><p> Remember to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/confessions-of-a-financial-planner-my-estate-is-not-in-order/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   update your will  </a> </u>  to specify who will serve as the guardian of your child if you and your spouse were to pass away. You can name someone else to handle any assets passed on, or you can establish a trust. A minor is unable to receive a life insurance benefit directly, so it&rsquo;s important to specify who will manage the benefit.</p><p> Even though dealing with insurance can be unpleasant, take the time to understand your options. By understanding your insurance benefits ahead of time, you can set your financial concerns aside and concentrate on the arrival of your new baby.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The week before last I was in Melbourne, Australia, attending a conference for chief executives from all over the world. While there, I spoke with many of my peers about the airline industry, which is currently in a&shy; three-year bull run as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Airlines Index. </strong></p><p> I was surprised to learn that several people incorrectly assumed that the airline industry is included in the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index. It does seems as if it belongs there, along with travel, hospitality and leisure. But the industry actually qualifies as an industrial.</p><p> Regardless of which sector airlines belong in, the fleet has flown past both industrials and consumer discretionaries for the five-year period.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"423\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1COMM-Airlines-Flew-Past-Industrials-and-Consumer-Discretionary-04022015.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Not only that, but airlines were the best-performing industry in industrials for the one-year, three-year and five-year periods.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-08-at-11.58.30-AM.png\" width=\"649\"/></p><p> A misconception held among some investors is that airline stocks are outperforming right now only because fuel costs are down. Fuel, after all, accounted for about 30 percent of carriers&rsquo; operating costs in 2014. The implication, some believe, is that when oil prices begin to recover, airlines will be first to feel the pinch.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case. The industry is in a much more rational business environment than it was a decade ago. Over the last five years, fundamental changes have taken place, including consolidation, new sources of revenue, better fuel efficiency and additional seats, that have helped airlines excel even when oil is $100 per barrel or more.</p><p> In fact, airline stocks for the four industry leaders&mdash;United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines&mdash;began their recent ascent even before oil prices began to plummet 50 to 60 percent starting last summer.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3COMM-Airline-Stocks-Defied-High-Fuel-Costs-04022015.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> And because most airlines hedge their fuel, they&rsquo;re still locked into $100-per-barrel oil prices and therefore haven&rsquo;t yet felt the full benefits of lower fuel costs. American is one of the few that doesn&rsquo;t hedge.</p><p> <strong>  Airline research analyst Helane Becker of financial services firm Cowen Group writes:  </strong> American participates in 100 percent of the decline in jet fuel prices. The current per gallon price is $1.78, and American uses 4.4 billion gallons of jet fuel annually, so every $1 change in oil [saves the company] approximately $105 million per month.</p><p> Contributing to American&rsquo;s diminishing operating costs is its purchase of dozens of new aircraft&mdash;99 delivered last year, 112 expected this year&mdash;that will replace older, less-fuel efficient jets. This should help the company save millions not only in jet fuel but also maintenance fees for many years to come.</p><p> It should also be noted that new baggage-tracking technology has led to a dramatic decrease in lost and mishandled luggage, helping airlines all over the globe save billions and keep passengers happy. Even as the number of worldwide passengers has steadily increased year-over-year&mdash;exceeding a record three billion in 2013&mdash;there&rsquo;s been a drop of 61 percent in missing bags since the peak in 2007. As a result, carriers save a collective $18 billion a year.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4COMM-Downtrend-in-Lost-and-Mishandled-Baggage-Saves-Airlines-18-Billion-a-Year_04022015.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> Free Cash Flow</h3><p> <br/> Often it&rsquo;s not enough to look just at a company&rsquo;s revenue for any given timeframe to determine its strength. A more precise metric is free cash flow, which tells you how much cash the company has in the bank after taxes and all operating expenses have been paid. In other words, it&rsquo;s what the company is &ldquo;free&rdquo; to spend.</p><p> The higher a company&rsquo;s free cash flow yield, the better. When the yield is higher, the company is more likely to plow that extra cash back into its growth or declare a dividend. American, for instance, began paying a dividend last summer; Alaska Airlines, the summer before last.</p><p> Last year, Delta announced a stock buyback plan worth $2 billion and a dividend increase of 50 percent. At this May&rsquo;s Bank of America Merrill Lynch Industrials Conference, the company is expected to make a similar announcement&mdash;another buyback authorization and a possible dividend boost of 25 percent.</p><p> As you can see below, U.S. airlines&rsquo; free cash flow is expected to reach a record high this year and each subsequent year. Domestic carriers have never had this much cash potential on their hands&mdash;cash that can be used to grow and improve their businesses as well as reward shareholders. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5-COMM-Domestic-Airlines-Are-Forecast-to-See-Greatest-Free-Cash-Flow-in-Years_04022015.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> If we look at individual companies&rsquo; free cash flow, three of them&mdash;Delta, Southwest and United Airlines&mdash;are expected to have yields above an impressive 10 percent in 2015.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6-COMM-US-Airlines-Estimated-2015-Free-Cash-Flow-Yield_04022015.gif\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> <strong>  An airline industry report by J.P. Morgan stated last week:  </strong> We believe in the persistence of cash flows and the presence of a good structural model. The sector has begun to show us their success instead of repeating &ldquo;trust me&rdquo;&hellip; [T]he cash is real, the margins are real, the buybacks are real.</p><p> In light of this success, some analysts are concerned that airlines, flush with cash for the first time in recent memory, will increase capacity too quickly and outpace demand.</p><p> Two main arguments can be made here. For one, the industry is highly correlated to a nation&rsquo;s GDP, and carriers have historically avoided growing faster than the economy by too wide of a margin. The second argument has to do with what experts believe is an imminent pilot shortage in the U.S.</p><h3> Pilot Shortage Ahead?</h3><p> <br/> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates that all pilots must retire at age 65, which should open up many commercial airliner positions over the coming years. But because the starting salary with a regional carrier is around $20,000 per year, fewer and fewer would-be aviators can justify the typical $50,000-a-year flight training, not to mention the required 1,500 hours of flight time before they can even be considered for a position.</p><p> You might be wondering why carriers aren&rsquo;t able to make up the difference by recruiting more pilots out of the military. The reason is because a greater number of people are being trained now to fly drones than jets&mdash;and piloting a drone doesn&rsquo;t count toward commercial flight hours.</p><p> This all might sound like troubling news, but it actually has the effect of encouraging discipline, reining in excessive spending and curbing carriers from growing too exuberantly. They can always increase seat capacity&mdash;to a certain extent, of course&mdash;but generally they&rsquo;re not going to spend money needlessly on new aircraft if there are fewer people available to pilot them.</p><p> <strong>  Read more about the airline industry: </strong></p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/global-airline-stocks-soaring-and-not-just-because-of-low-oil-prices/#.VR1TRf50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Global Airline Stocks Soaring, and Not Just Because of Low Oil Prices  </a> </u> <br/> Although it&rsquo;s true that fuel is carriers&rsquo; top operating expense&mdash;they collectively spent $48 billion on fuel in 2013&mdash;there&rsquo;s more to the industry&rsquo;s recent bull run than the low price of oil. In fact, airlines are in a better position now to manage an increase in oil prices than they have been in recent memory, for a number of reasons.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/the-airline-industry-ascended-to-new-records-in-2014/#.VR1Tnf50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Airline Industry Ascended to New Records in 2014  </a> </u> <br/> This year, the daily number of available seats for international-bound flights out of the U.S. will rise to an all-time high of over 350,000. That&rsquo;s 20,000 more seats per day than were available just last year.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/why-this-airline-just-landed-in-the-sp-500-index/#.VR1T6f50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Why This Airline Just landed in the S&amp;P 500 Index  </a> </u> <br/> Joining rivals Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, American Airlines is the newest member of the prestigious club for the nation&rsquo;s largest companies by market capitalization.

    "link": "wall-street-needs-to-hit-the-refresh-button-on-continuing-ed",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Refresher courses about money laundering aren&rsquo;t enough. Wall Streeters needs a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; into data and crowdsourcing tools.</p><p> Wall Street needs to reeducate itself about the meaning of continuing education. The way it&rsquo;s handled now is misdirected and ineffectual. When most brokerage employees hear the phrase \"continuing ed,\" they wince, because they associate the term with mandatory computerized training courses required by regulators. That's unfortunate, because there's never been a more critical time for financial professionals to continue their education.</p><p> FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) member firm employees are required to sit through continuing ed sessions at three-year intervals. (They sit, but they can hardly stand it). It's hard to argue against the merit of reviewing compliance, regulatory, and ethical rules. Yet employees roll their eyes at the thought of attending these sessions, which rely on operational scenarios having little to do with the day-to-day work of many securities professionals.</p><p> Despite these requirements, analysts remain under-educated about important financial topics. They work in an age of dramatic transformations in financial technology. Yet they're likely to spend their careers in a state of complacent oblivion about cutting-edge developments. The specialized nature of most finance jobs is such that staffers can perform their roles without being exposed to changes occurring at the periphery of their functional expertise.</p><p> I've included below a summary of three rapidly-evolvoing aspects of securities trading and investments. The specifics of these topics would be a revelation to many Wall Street professionals: </p><li> <p>  <strong>   Crowdsourcing:  </strong>  When many analysts and traders first hear about   <u>   <a href=\"http://stocktwits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    StockTwits   </a>  </u>  ,   <u>   <a href=\"https://www.hvst.com/dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Harvest   </a>  </u>  ,   <u>   <a href=\"http://marketprophit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    MarketProphit   </a>  </u>  , and   <u>   <a href=\"https://sumzero.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Sumzero   </a>  </u>  , they wrinkle their brows. Their only association with online stock discussion communities is the checkered world of Yahoo! Finance message boards, best known for rumors and conspiracy theories. Few analysts and traders are aware that high-caliber discussions, forecasts, and research can now be found on crowdsourcing websites.  </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Cashtagging:  </strong>  I'm often surprised by the readiness of experienced analysts and traders to dismiss the relevance of Twitter &ndash; even though that platform has become an important medium for sharing business news and opinions. Few are familiar with the existence of the cashtag (the pairing of dollar signs with ticker symbols in order to denote stock-specific messages). Conducting cashtag searches on Twitter can reveal important stock-related conversations.  </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Sentiment-Screening:  </strong>  Many Wall Street staffers are familiar with big data. However, few of them understand how their hedge fund clients use data services to mine Twitter and other social media venues for news and sentiment. The traders and analysts who work in New York's financial district might not even be aware that influential data science firms, like Dataminr, are headquartered in Silicon Alley, just miles from their offices. </p></li><p> During my tenure on Wall Street, I helped manage several training programs, geared towards junior research professionals. My \"mock\" research calls and writing workshops focused on important skills. However, senior finance professionals were generally not the target of our training. Even if they had been required to participate in training classes, important topics like datamining and crowdsourcing would not likely have been part of the curriculum.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> If you tried to research website design companies using a search engine, your search would return a lot of different companies. It&rsquo;s hard to pick out the bad designers from the commonplace. And even more concerning, it can be tricky to distinguish &ldquo;okay&rdquo; web design companies from truly exemplary ones.</p><p> <strong>  So how do you know the companies you are choosing between are really as good as their website says they are? </strong>  Here are twelve signs we&rsquo;ve determined will let you know that you&rsquo;re working with a truly professional website design company:</p><h3> How they get started: <br/>  </h3><li> They practice what they preach. They use online marketing skills to generate leads for themselves, and they know how to do it for your company, too.</li><li> Their portfolio shows results, not just pretty pictures. Case studies contain real numbers that matter to a business. The best can measure revenue and ROI that your website brings in.</li><li> Their clients endorse them. The best website design companies bring in new work from word of mouth, but have no trouble getting clients to give rave reviews.</li><li> They turn down projects that aren&rsquo;t a good fit. They know what they are good at, and they don&rsquo;t fake being an expert at something (or an industry) in which they don&rsquo;t have experience or passion. <br/>  </li><h3> What they offer: <br/>  </h3><li> Customer-focused design. They don&rsquo;t take risks with your business by designing for fancy graphic design awards. Instead, they develop a deep understanding of your target customer to drive the design and function of your website.</li><li> Great writing ability. What? You mean great website design is not just graphic design? The best website design companies have a team of writers to help their clients communicate clearly and convincingly.</li><li> Content management systems that empower you. They don&rsquo;t just give you a great CMS, but they customize it to suit the technical abilities of your staff.  They train you how to use it so that you can edit what you need to edit how you want to edit it.</li><li> Design and development, not just customization. They don&rsquo;t just start with a WordPress theme that requires certain visual elements, but can do their own custom design with Photoshop and hand coding to give you a unique, branded experience. <br/>  </li><h3> How they work: <br/>  </h3><li> They practice good project management. We all get distracted every once in a while. The best website design team keeps their team and your team on task, on budget, and on time.</li><li> They are web experts, but can speak in layman&rsquo;s terms. Your design team is technically competent, but they are also able to communicate what they&rsquo;re doing and why. They are transparent and give you information you can understand.</li><li> They don&rsquo;t need babysitting. You can rest assured that communication between the agency and you will be consistent and that the project will progress according to the timeline.</li><li> They don&rsquo;t leave you hanging. They offer a warranty on their work and superior support services once the project is done. You will feel comfortable calling and asking a question, or just requesting changes.</li><p> <br/> <strong>  The best website design companies for you to work with may not jump off the page at first. We talk to companies all the time that have experienced unresponsive, inexperienced, too busy, incompetent web designers. </strong></p><p> Before you start your website redesign project, figure out if they&rsquo;re the real thing. Dig a little deeper and ask as many questions as possible. When you know how they get started, what they can offer you, and how they work, you&rsquo;ll know if they&rsquo;re the website design company that can meet your needs.</p><p> Your turn: What things make you nervous about outsourcing a website redesign? What are your pet peeves when working with a web designer or marketing vendor?</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/smart-marketing-template_3.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Belle Beth CooperWe&rsquo;re pretty keen on optimal timing for social media here at  <u>  <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buffer  </a> </u> , and I figured it was high time I collected all the information we have about online communication into one place. I&rsquo;ve collected research and stats on Twitter, Facebook, email and blogging to help you find the best time to communicate with others in each format.The tricky thing I&rsquo;ve come across is that since the web is still so new,  <strong>  a lot of the research available to us is conflicting. </strong> We really need more time and more studies to get definitive answers about what works best, and the fact that our audience members are constantly changing their own activity patterns makes it even harder to work out for sure. Looking at the latest  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/10-surprising-social-media-statistics-that-will-make-you-rethink-your-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media stats  </a> </u>  seems to only confirm that.So my suggestion would be to use this guide as just that&mdash;a guide to help you work out what to test for your own audience, so that you can see what actually works best in your specific case.Let&rsquo;s get into the stats then! <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/timing.png\"/> <strong>  Facebook &ndash; find the best time to post your updates </strong> In our research into  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-news-feed-algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook&rsquo;s News Feed algorithm  </a> </u> , we found that one of the key considerations to the visibility of a post is engagement&mdash;clicks, comments, reshares, etc. Therefore, finding an ideal time for engagement could be a boon to getting your Facebook post more reach.In terms of specific days and times to post on Facebook, here are some of the stats I found: <strong>  Engagement rates are 18% higher on Thursdays and Fridays. </strong> I love the way this was explained in  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/7-facebook-stats-you-should-know-for-a-more-engaging-page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buddy Media&rsquo;s study  </a> </u> : as they put it, &ldquo;the less people want to be at work, the more they are on Facebook!&rdquo; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-23-at-6.47.02-PM.png\"/> Specific industries varied slightly in which days of the week garnered the most engagement, but most of them sit around the end of the week, from Wednesday to Friday.Another study found that <strong>   engagement was   <u>   <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-stats-studies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    32% higher on weekends   </a>  </u> </strong> , so the end of the week is definitely a good, rough guide to start experimenting with. The following infographic from  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.kissmetrics.com/science-of-social-timing-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   KISSmetrics  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dan Zarrella  </a> </u>  describes it well: <img alt=\"\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-facebook-saturday.jpg\" width=\"600\"/> The best time of day to post on Facebook is debatable, with stats ranging from 1:00 p.m. to get the most shares, to 3:00 p.m. to get more clicks, to the broader suggestion of any time between 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. It seems that this generally points to  <strong>  early afternoon being a solid time to post </strong> , and anytime after dinner and before work being a long shot.For more  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/7-facebook-stats-you-should-know-for-a-more-engaging-page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Facebook stats  </u>  , </a>  we&rsquo;ve written  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a complete Facebook guide  </a> </u>  for you to check out. <strong>  Twitter &ndash; when is the best time to tweet for engagement vs. clicks </strong> Twitter is such a popular network for mobile users that it can be a bit tricky to lock down exactly when the best time to post is. Here are some suggestions from the research I&rsquo;ve found:Twitter engagement for brands is 17% higher on weekends according to  <u>  Dan Zarrella&rsquo;s research </u> . <img alt=\"\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/info.png\" width=\"550\"/>  If you&rsquo;re tweeting from your company account, you might want to keep this in mind, especially if engagement is what you&rsquo;re looking for.  <u>  <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buffer  </a> </u>  can help you spread out your tweets to post at the optimal times, so you don&rsquo;t even have to work weekends to take advantage of this! Click-through rates are generally highest on weekends, as well as mid-week, on Wednesdays.On the other hand, an  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-stats-studies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Argyle Social  </a> </u>  study showed that  <strong>  weekdays provide 14% more engagement than weekends </strong> , so this is definitely one you&rsquo;ll want to test on your audience. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-02-at-9.42.44-AM.png\"/> When we look at the time of day,  <strong>  retweets have been   <u>   <a href=\"http://blog.kissmetrics.com/science-of-social-timing-1/?wide=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    shown to be highest around 5pm   </a>  </u>  . </strong> <img alt=\"\" height=\"221\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-5pm_0.jpg\" width=\"600\"/> <strong>  For click-throughs, the best times seem to be around noon and 6pm. </strong> <img alt=\"\" height=\"246\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-twitter-noon-and-6pm.jpg\" width=\"600\"/> This could be due to lunch breaks and people looking for something to keep them occupied on the commute home after work. <img alt=\"\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tweet-times_0.jpg\" width=\"550\"/> There are lots of Twitter users who primarily use a mobile device&mdash;rarely loading up Twitter on their desktops. Twitter did  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/10-new-twitter-stats-twitter-statistics-to-help-you-reach-your-followers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   an interesting study  </a> </u>  of these users and found that they are  <strong>  181% more likely to be on Twitter during their commute. </strong> They&rsquo;re also  <strong>  119% more likely to use Twitter during school or work hours. </strong> For more details on the latest  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/10-new-twitter-stats-twitter-statistics-to-help-you-reach-your-followers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter stats  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/10-new-twitter-stats-twitter-statistics-to-help-you-reach-your-followers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter statistics  </a> </u> , check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/10-new-twitter-stats-twitter-statistics-to-help-you-reach-your-followers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this Twitter guide  </a> </u> . <strong>  Email &ndash; find the best time to send for the right content </strong> There&rsquo;s been lots of research done on the best time to send emails, particularly in the case of email marketing. Some research done by  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.kissmetrics.com/science-of-social-timing-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dan Zarrella from Hubspot  </a> </u>  broke down each time of day and worked out which type of emails work best for that period. Here&rsquo;s what he found:</p><li> <strong>  10pm&ndash;6am: </strong> This is the dead zone, when hardly any emails get opened.</li><li> <strong>  6am&ndash;10am: </strong> Consumer-based marketing emails are best sent early in the morning.</li><li> <strong>  10am-noon: </strong> Most people are working, and probably won&rsquo;t open your email.</li><li> <strong>  Noon&ndash;2pm: </strong> News and magazine updates are popular during lunch breaks.</li><li> <strong>  2&ndash;3pm: </strong> After lunch lots of people buckle down and ignore their inbox.</li><li> <strong>  3&ndash;5pm: </strong> Property and financial-related offers are best sent in the early afternoon.</li><li> <strong>  5&ndash;7pm: </strong> Holiday promotions &amp; B2B promotions get opened mostly in the early evening.</li><li> <strong>  7&ndash;10pm: </strong> Consumer promotions are popular again after dinner.</li>What I thought was really interesting about this breakdown is why each type of email is more popular at certain times. From 3&ndash;5pm, for instance, the reason people open financial and property-related emails is that they&rsquo;re more likely to be thinking about their life situation and how to improve it. Understanding how these time blocks work can be a good start to sending your emails at just the right time.And since <strong> 23.63% of emails are opened  <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/62688-six-case-studies-and-infographics-on-the-optimal-time-to-send-emails\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  within an hour of being received </a> , this is something we definitely want to get right.</strong>For more general emails, <strong> open rates, click-through rates and abuse reports were all found to be highest during early mornings and on weekends.</strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-clicks-morning.jpg\" width=\"600\"/><img alt=\"\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-early-morning.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>This probably means that most of us have more time to dedicate to our inbox during these periods, rather than during the day when we&rsquo;re trying to get work done.<img alt=\"\" height=\"219\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-clicks-weekend.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>In <u> <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/62688-six-case-studies-and-infographics-on-the-optimal-time-to-send-emails\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a different study by MailChimp </a></u> open rates were shown to be <strong> noticeably lower on weekends.</strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing_-_mail_chimp_open_days.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>They also found that <strong> open rates increased after 12pm, and were highest between 2pm and 5pm.</strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"262\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing_-_mail_chimp_opens.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>A <u> <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/62688-six-case-studies-and-infographics-on-the-optimal-time-to-send-emails\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GetResponse study </a></u> backed this up by showing that open rates drop off slightly, and <strong> click-through rates drop significantly on weekends.</strong>GetResponse found that <strong> Thursday is the best day for both open rates and click-throughs.</strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing_-_get_response_open_weekends.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>Mark Suster offers <u> <a href=\"http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/08/25/how-to-get-people-to-take-action-when-you-send-an-email/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  some great advice </a></u> when it comes to sending emails:Often I&rsquo;ll write emails on the weekend and then send first thing Monday morning. I want to be on top of the stack, not at the bottom of the pile. Most people process email first thing in the morning (although productivity experts say not to!).BTW, when I wrote blog posts on Sundays I always tweet again Monday morning for exactly this reason.<strong> Blog posts &ndash; what time should you hit publish on your posts?</strong>So let&rsquo;s take a look at when to publish blog posts.Dan Zarrella has some more <u> <a href=\"http://blog.kissmetrics.com/science-of-social-timing-3/?wide=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  great stats </a></u> on this topic, but he makes a good point about the pros and cons of the timing you choose. One thing Dan suggests we consider is that <strong> if we post during time of higher traffic, we&rsquo;re more likely to have higher bounce rates</strong><strong> and get lost amongst the noise</strong> of other content being published.On the other hand, <strong> posting at times when fewer people are online will garner less traffic and engagement, but give our posts more prominence and less competition against other content.</strong>Here are some useful stats from Dan&rsquo;s research into blog timing:<img alt=\"\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-morning-blogs.jpg\" width=\"600\"/><li> <strong>  70% of users say they read blogs in the morning </strong></li><li> <strong>  More men read blogs at night than women </strong></li><li> <strong>  Mondays are the highest traffic days for an average blog </strong></li><li> <strong>  11am is usually the highest traffic hour for an average blog </strong></li><li> <strong>  Comments are usually highest on Saturdays and around 9am on most days </strong></li><li> <strong>  Blogs that post more than once per day have a higher chance of inbound links and more unique views </strong></li>Knowing your audience is obviously important for working out the best time to publish on your blog. If your audience is women, for instance, mornings are probably a better bet than nights.<img alt=\"\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing-men.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>While Mondays are the best days to publish for traffic, <u> <a href=\"http://socialfresh.com/best-time-of-day-to-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Social Fresh </a></u> suggests <strong> posting on a Thursday for more social shares</strong> across the web. Here are also more ideas <u> <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-writing-great-headlines-on-twitter-facebook-and-your-blog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  to find the best time to publish blogposts </a></u>.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timing_-_blog_for_shares.jpg\" width=\"600\"/> This study also found that most content sharing happens in the morning, which backs up Dan&rsquo;s stats that mornings are the most popular time to read blogs.With Buffer&rsquo;s new <u> custom scheduling feature</u>, you can now publish your post whenever suits you and schedule it to be promoted on social networks at a more optimal time. Plus, you can now <u> <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/introducing-buffer-for-google-plus-pages-scheduling-posting-social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  send and schedule posts to Google+ from Buffer </a></u>!<strong> Timing depends on the individual</strong>Timing is difficult to get exactly right, and a big part of this is because we all have different schedules and routines for checking email or using social media. <u> <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/62688-six-case-studies-and-infographics-on-the-optimal-time-to-send-emails\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  An experiment </a></u> by online retailer eBags showed this point perfectly. Looking at the latest <u> <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/10-surprising-social-media-statistics-that-will-make-you-rethink-your-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  social media statistics </a></u> the range of different schedules seems to only increase too.The company thought that when users were signing up to an email list, that was probably a good time of day for them to be online, so sending emails to them at that same time of day would work best. By analyzing the behavior of each individual user, eBags sent out emails to users at the same time of day they had signed up for the email list.This actually worked incredibly well: <strong> click-through rates rose by 20% and conversion rates rose by 65%.</strong>Unfortunately, this is such a complicated and time-consuming process that it wasn&rsquo;t sustainable. Hopefully these kind of features can be built into social media and email management tools in the future so we can all take advantage of these insights!<strong> Over to you</strong>Since it&rsquo;s still so difficult to find the optimal time for each type of online communication that will work for everyone, I&rsquo;d love to hear about your personal experiences. <strong> What works best for you?</strong> You can comment below, send me an <u> <a href=\"mailto:hello@bufferapp.com\">  email </a></u> or catch me on Twitter at <u> <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bellebethcooper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  @bellebethcooper </a></u>.P.S.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Philip Marshall was devoted to his grandmother, wealthy philanthropist, Brooke Astor.  </strong> Her victimization by her own son, Philip&rsquo;s father, Anthony Marshall, created irreparable harm to the relationships in the family.  Anthony Marshall and one of his attorneys conspired to divert millions of dollars to Anthony&rsquo;s benefit after Ms. Astor developed dementia.  They were both convicted in criminal court of financial elder abuse.  Would you have had the courage to stand up to your own father and take on the cause of justice of your grandmother if you had been in Philip&rsquo;s shoes?</p><p> Philip recently contributed to the American Bar Association&rsquo;s journal BiFocal, a publication of the Commission on Law and Aging.  He wrote a piece in the hope that the telling of his sad family circumstances would continue to contribute to the recognition of elder abuse and exploitation as an insidious and pervasive national problem.  Parts of his article are summarized here.</p><p> Philip did not start out as an expert in elder abuse.  He loved his grandmother, who had always been a donor to worthy causes, being described as &ldquo;a humanist aristocrat with a  generous heart&rdquo;.  In her later years, she was increasingly isolated by the actions of Anthony Marshall.  Close friends were denied visits. A long time and caring staff member was fired.  Anthony Marshall, Brooke&rsquo;s only child, had been appointed power of attorney. He used his power to abuse and control her. There were many red flags in Anthony Marshall&rsquo;s actions. He sold Brooke&rsquo;s favorite painting, which she had bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the objects of her charitable giving in her earlier life.  The paining brought millions, two of which Anthony kept as a commission.</p><p> Brooke loved her country house, where she hoped to spend her final days. Anthony closed the housed and fired Brooke&rsquo;s most loyal staff member, her butler Chris Ely.  Under pressure from two of Brooke&rsquo;s closest friends, Anthony reluctantly agreed to reopen the country house, but shortly after that, moved his mother back to her apartment in New York.</p><p> Philip was suspicious of what he saw happening and began to speak with more staff and caregivers.  He learned that his grandmother&rsquo;s lifestyle, emotional and physical care and life were being compromised by his father&rsquo;s actions.  He could not bear the damage he witnessed to her psychological and physical well being. He sought advice.  He met with his grandmothers&rsquo; close friends and decided that something should be done.  </p><p> Philip petitioned for guardianship.  This always presents an uphill battle when the only adult child is in charge and the psychological abuse and neglect are so difficult to prove.  The petition was granted and Philip immediately moved his grandmother back to her country house.  By the time the petition was granted, his father was forced to return over $11 million in assets and pledged over $10 million to cover any future claims.  But the battle was far from over.</p><p> Ms. Astor died peacefully in 2007 with friends at her side.  Following her death, Anthony Marshall filed papers on court using three codicils (additions) to her will which redistributed almost $100 million to his control.  The unbridled greed of Philip&rsquo;s father was shocking. He was already provided over $60 million in the original will. That wasn&rsquo;t enough.  He had to conspire, forge documents, manipulate and abuse his own mother to get tens of millions more.</p><p> The New York DA had evidence of the criminal abuse case and indicted both Anthony Marshall and his attorney, Francis Morrissey.  The case went to trial in 2009.  Philip had to testify against his father.  There were many witnesses to the abuse and financial manipulation.   Anthony Marshall was convicted on 15 of the 16 counts against him.   All counts but one were upheld on appeal.</p><p> At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvesor.com  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.agingparents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingParents.com  </a> </u> , we are vigorous advocates for stopping elder abuse.  We applaud Philip Marshall not only for his courage to bring the guardianship petition in the first place, but to continue the battle to honor his grandmother&rsquo;s legacy of charitable giving, as originally provided in her will.  His actions came with a huge emotional and economic cost to himself.  But could not live with the injustice he saw.  He was willing to air the family&rsquo;s dirty linen in public. He was willing to take sides and stand up for the  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.agingparents.com/category/parents-with-dementia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   vulnerable person with dementia  </a> </u>  his grandmother had become.  Let his story be an inspiration to all of us.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The Ancient Greeks used the word  ἔ&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;  , meaning custom, or practice&mdash;from which we, of course, get our word ethos </strong> , which has similar but broader interpretations including disposition, character, and beliefs. <strong>  This root word also brings us the term ethics. </strong> It occurs to me that nowhere is reflection on this word ethos more important that in our own journey from management to leadership. There have now been some four experiences in my career where I have witnessed the phenomenon that the collective output of a group of co-workers has far exceeded the actual combined abilities and skills of those co-workers. Something happens. There is a flourishing that is borne by the co-operative effort of these co-workers that is ignited by trust and a deeply shared ethos. In such environments effort seems effort-less!</p><p> Financial analysts can find trace evidence of such a phenomenon in elements of corporate valuation. These days we have so many approaches to enterprise valuation, many of them building off the standard discounted cash flow model. We look at stock price to book ratios, price to earnings ratios, price to sales ratios, price to &lsquo;earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization&rsquo; ratios, beta comparisons and price to you-name-it ratios. Indeed, if we look simply at the difference between the accounting enterprise value of a publicly traded company and its total market capitalization, investors are usually banking on a future that is better (or worse) than the present situation of a company. <strong>  Well how about a price to ethos ratio? In fact I believe that such work can be done and it shines a light on the enduring ability of leadership to make the proverbial whole bigger than the sum-of-the-parts. </strong></p><p> I think that often, when a manager recognizes that she or he is the custodian of the company&rsquo;s ethos, it actually marks the transition from management to leadership. When our colleagues, employees, stakeholders and customers know exactly what we stand for, our price-to-ethos valuation not only rises, but it will surely be noticed.   <br/> <br/> Published with acknowledgement to Thomson Carswell, publishers of the 2nd edition of Sales Force Management in the Financial Services by Paul K.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  We talk a lot about being inclusive of those in your workplace&mdash;it&rsquo;s the best way to increase productivity and create a strong culture. </strong> But, inclusivity extends beyond your workforce to your customers, or your market. Starbucks&rsquo; controversial new campaign drives this point home.</p><p> Last month, Starbucks announced its new &ldquo;Race Together&rdquo; campaign. In essence, baristas write the phrase &ldquo;Race Together&rdquo; on customer orders with the goal that baristas and customers will engage in conversation about race relations.</p><p> In the Associated Press article <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_STARBUCKS_ANNUAL_MEETING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;  <u>   Starbucks CEO defends &lsquo;Race Together&rsquo; after backlash  </u>  ,&rdquo; </a>  Candice Choi discusses what other tactics are included in the campaign. &ldquo;Starbucks also plans to start publishing &lsquo;conversation guides&rsquo; on the topic,&rdquo; which might encourage customers to have these discussions amongst themselves. Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, noted that baristas and customers don&rsquo;t have to participate in the campaign&mdash;it&rsquo;s only encouraged or suggested that they do.</p><p> The campaign seems to have two camps: those who support it and find it to be a good idea, and those who think, at best, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense and, at worst, it&rsquo;s insensitive.</p><p> <strong>  As noted in the article, some people think it is &ldquo;opportunistic and inappropriate for a coffee chain to insert itself into such an important issue.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Starbucks isn&rsquo;t the only organization to create campaigns for a particular cause or an important issue facing society. Whether or not the board behind the brand truly believes in the cause they&rsquo;re supporting, their support for a cause gives them more visibility to customers.</p><p> Whether it makes sense or not is another question. Choi points out that <strong>  Dove has had great success with the &ldquo;Real Beauty&rdquo; campaign, which celebrates the beauty of all women of every race, size and level of beauty. </strong></p><p> What makes the Dove campaign different than Starbucks&rsquo;, though, is that beauty is associated with Dove products, products that promote beauty and health. Laura Ries, a branding consultant, says &ldquo;&rsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with talking about race relations&hellip; but is it something people naturally associate with Starbucks? It&rsquo;s not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, many people are experiencing confusion and doubt over this campaign because of the lack of connection between our country&rsquo;s race relations and Starbucks lattes. Time will tell how Starbucks handles the situation and what impact, if any, the controversy will have on its brand. </p><p> Companies that choose to support social issues must take into consideration how a particular cause relates to their company, their employees, and their markets. Companies must also be cognizant of the real potential to&mdash;however unintended&mdash;offend, exclude or exhibit bias toward them.</p><p> <strong>  Unconscious bias, even if it&rsquo;s well-intended, can have real bottom line impacts. Alienating customers can hurt your bottom line.   </strong></p>",

    "content": "<h3> What are the Six Pillars that Nunwood has dubbed \"the DNA of a successful customer experience?\"</h3><p> <br/> I was recently sent an advance copy of the  <u>  2015 Nunwood US Customer Experience Excellence Report </u> . The report focuses on best practices in the US market, investigating which businesses excel, why, and how UK brands can learn from US customer experience leaders. (Nunwood is based in London.) <br/> <br/> The part of the report that intrigued me was the Six Pillars that form the basis of their assessment; the Pillars are: personalization, integrity, time and effort, expectations, resolutions, and empathy. (The Pillars are coupled with advocacy - likelihood to recommend - and loyalty to generate a customer experience score, which they use to rank the brands evaluated in this study.) They were derived from years of research and driven by the need to define what a good experience looks like. <br/> <br/> From  <u>  Nunwood </u> 's website... <br/> <br/> <strong>  The Six Pillars are the universal characteristics of all brilliant customer experiences. Strong performance across all six is shown to: </strong></p><li> Increase acquisition, via advocacy</li><li> Create long-term shareholder value</li><li> Guarantee a market leading customer experience ranking <br/>  </li><p> The report states that the top 10 brands (based on customer experience) achieve an almost 10 times greater increase in share price growth than the norm. <br/> <br/> Nunwood refers to the Six Pillars as the \"DNA of successful experiences,\" \"the definition of customer experience excellence,\" and \"pivotal to top 10 performance.\" So let's look at the Six. <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Personalization </strong> <br/> Defined as: Using individualized attention to drive an emotional connection. Demonstrating that you know the customer and his specific needs or circumstances and adapting the experience to what you know is key. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Expectations </strong> <br/> Defined as: Managing, meeting, and exceeding customer expectations. Expectations are pre-experience beliefs about how a product or service will be delivered. These serve as a reference point against which the performance of an organization will be judged. Expectations are set through the brand promise, as well as through consistent delivery of the experience. Obviously, knowing customer expectations is the only way to meet or exceed them. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Empathy </strong> <br/> Defined as: Achieving an understanding of the customer&rsquo;s circumstances to drive rapport. Empathy is the emotional capacity to show you understand someone else&rsquo;s experience. Empathy can be taught. The report gives examples from customers about how employees show they care: (1) they pay attention, listen, and show they understand; (2) they go out of their way for the customer; and (3) they do a little something extra or unexpected. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Time and Effort </strong> <br/> Defined as: Minimizing customer effort and creating frictionless processes. This is huge. If companies focus more on being easy to do business with, imagine the delight customers would feel, in general! Talk about expectations; I think this is an expectation we all have when we interact with a company. Why does it have to be so painful? <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Integrity </strong> <br/> Defined as: Being trustworthy and engendering trust. Integrity is an outcome of consistent organizational behavior that demonstrates trustworthiness. The top 10 brands demonstrate that they are not in it purely for the profit; they put the customer before profits and do right by the customer. <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Resolution </strong> <br/> Defined as: Minimizing customer effort and creating frictionless processes. While the definition makes it feel like this is redundant with Time and Effort, digging deeper into this Pillar reveals that it's more about service recovery. Their statement that \"a sincere apology and acting with urgency are two crucial elements of successful resolution\" makes for a better explanation of this Pillar. <br/> <br/> Nunwood believes that the best brands will achieve success when they focus training, processes, technology, and culture on these Six Pillars. Personally, I can't argue with any of the Six. <br/> <br/> In the old world, you devoted 30% of your time to building a great service and 70% of your time to shouting about it. In the new world, that inverts. -Jeff Bezos </p>",

    "content": "<p> When I&rsquo;m not on the road spreading the good word of social media and financial services, then you can find me sweating behind the handle bars of a fake bike listening to awesome music. I love to spin.  Fortunately, I work with several people who also enjoy spinning.</p><p> As I was walking to get some water, I stopped by a co-workers&rsquo;s cube and asked her if she was going to spin on Saturday.  She wasn&rsquo;t sure and said, &ldquo;I will message you on Facebook and let you know.&rdquo;  I nodded my headed, took a few steps to the water cooler and then thought, &ldquo;How many people did this today?&rdquo;</p><p> Messaging has become a relevant verb in our daily lives.  Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and even Pinterest all have messaging features that allow people to communicate privately from the masses.  So why not just email someone?  Or text them?  And how many people are actually doing this?  So, let&rsquo;s discuss.</p><p> <strong>  Why not just email someone? </strong>   Let me ask you a question:  do you like receiving or sending email?  Didn&rsquo;t think so.  Email has a lot of &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; that is just not attractive anymore.  Lifehacker.com had a great article a year ago that talked about the different messaging apps and why people are attracted to them.  You can find that piece  <u>  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/whats-the-deal-with-all-these-messaging-apps-1561543034\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p><p> Messaging apps clean it all up and force users to get to the point (many of them limit your character space), they make use other apps like Dropbox for attachments and you can do it all within your favorite social networking platform so you don&rsquo;t have to leave one to go to another.  Efficient!</p><p> It&rsquo;s important that financial service organizations recognize this trend and adapt.  Many of the archiving and retention platforms like Smarsh, Actiance and Hearsay have already started and allow you to track these conversations compliantly by registering your accounts through their dashboard.</p><p> <strong>  Why not text someone?  </strong>  Well, you could but that&rsquo;s a separate application on your phone.  People want to stay in the app that they are currently in and really do see email, text, message, etc.as unified communication methods that transcend one another.  Compliance officers though&hellip;not so much that they agree with this thinking!  They want everything SEPARATED!</p><p> Appending to my last point about email, archiving and retention platforms cannot track text messages.  For that reason, many registered reps will see in their communication guidelines that text messaging is not allowed for business.  This is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6981-secure-messaging-apps-business.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   where messaging apps could be  more helpful.  </a> </u>  By keeping your messages on a monitored and controlled social networking platform like LinkedIn connected to Smarsh (or any variation of this) could serve you very well and even replace a large part of your texting.</p><p> <strong>  How many people are messaging? </strong>   In a word&hellip;LOTS!   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingprofs.com/charts/2015/27389/how-much-do-people-use-messaging-apps-hint-a-lot?adref=nlt040315\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MarketingProfs just shared an article on the topic where Ayaz Nanji wrote about the data compiled by Flurry  </a> </u> .  These apps are being used more often than any other on the smartphone and their retention is supreme.  [In other words, we think messaging apps are awesome and are going to keep using them!]</p><p> I think messaging apps are going to be the  <u>  way of communication more often chosen by financial service professionals in the coming months </u> .  They are easy-to-use and we just need to get more monitoring around them so compliance feels comfortable about those isolated conversations.  The apps themselves are definitely not going away though.</p><p> What are your favorite apps?  Do you enjoy messaging?  What do you like or not like about it?  I encourage you to share in the comments below or reach out on social media and let us know.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Personal brand authority: when you&rsquo;re recognized as a leading expert by your sweet-spot clients and buyers.</p><p> What&rsquo;s it buy you?</p><p> Instant credibility.</p><p> Which gives you the power to influence&mdash;and often to lead&mdash;the conversation in your niche. Your ideas get aired and you become THE go-to authority. Oh and did I mention it also paves the way to price yourself at the top of the heap? So there&rsquo;s that&hellip;</p><p> Building personal brand authority is a highly personal journey&mdash;after all, no one else has exactly your talents, your experiences, your dreams and your story.</p><p> But I&rsquo;ve found most experts&mdash;consultants, coaches, advisors, authors, speakers and freelancers&mdash;tend to be wired primarily in one of five categories: the evangelist, the journalist, the alchemist, the rocket scientist and the rock star.</p><p> <strong>  Evangelist </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re an evangelist&mdash;in personal brand authority terms&mdash;you&rsquo;re the visionary. You&rsquo;ll take risks to put your belief system out into the world. You may well have an untraditional background that powered your journey and becomes a critical part of your story.</p><p> Many evangelists build their initial authority through business success, like Steve Jobs, Seth Godin and Alexa von Tobel.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re an evangelist, you want to lead with your spin on why your belief system is worthy of latching onto. Your audience thrives on high-touch, emotional connection. So how you use story will be incredibly important&mdash;both your own and the transformation stories of your clients and buyers.</p><p> <strong>  Journalist </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re a journalist, you are the interpreter. You dig deep to make connections between events, ideas and people. Your genius lies in your insight&mdash;you&rsquo;re often an astute observer far beyond your core area of expertise. And you like nothing more than the interview: a conversation where you get to ask the questions that intrigue you.</p><p> Think actual journalists&mdash;like say Malcolm Gladwell and Ron Lieber&mdash;or those who think like journalists: Dan Pink and Gail Sheehy for example.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a journalist, you want to lead with your insight&mdash;since your highest value to your audience is in sorting through conflicting ideas and data. You build your authority by interpreting data and interviewing the right people. You can vary the form (written, podcast, video) based on your style and audience.</p><p> <strong>  Alchemist </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re an alchemist&mdash;you are the change agent. Busy turning lead into gold, your gift is a high touch approach with your audience. They feel seen and heard and understood. They feel that you care deeply about their transformation. You may well be a creative seeker&mdash;looking for new ways to practice your alchemy.</p><p> Think Deepak Chopra, Christiane Northrup, Marie Forleo.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re an alchemist, you want to lead with your belief system, with your manifesto. You want to demonstrate it in as many high-touch ways as possible, since your audience needs to trust that you&rsquo;ll deliver them into the new golden state you&rsquo;ve promised. Like the evangelist, it&rsquo;s your stories that cement their connection with you.</p><p> <strong>  Rocket Scientist </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re a rocket scientist, you are the sage&mdash;you lead with your intellect. You might have made your mark in academia or a big firm or maybe you just love yourself some research. You&rsquo;re entranced by ideas and data and making connections between them.</p><p> Think Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Jonah Berger and Bren&eacute; Brown&mdash;all classic rocket scientists.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a rocket scientist, you&rsquo;ll typically build authority through publishing your findings and insights&mdash;heavily supported by data. But if you want to mesmerize a broader audience, don&rsquo;t be afraid to stir up the pot and give us something we can get emotionally excited about.</p><p> <strong>  Rock Star </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re a rock star, you&rsquo;re simply transcendent&mdash;your audience idolizes you far beyond your original expertise. Your genius is being able to connect your audience directly to their dream. Chances are, you also tend to speak your mind&mdash;sometimes bluntly&mdash;which wins you raving fans (and die-hard haters).</p><p> Think Suze Orman, Dr Phil, Tony Robbins, Martha Stewart.</p><p> Rock stars tend to build authority based on where they started&mdash;typically as an evangelist, a journalist or an alchemist. You&rsquo;ll see the occasional rocket scientist&mdash;like a Dr. Oz. But they are all creators&mdash;building content and relationships with their audience.</p><p> If you want to be a rock star, focus building your authority on your key strengths. If you&rsquo;re an alchemist for example, you keep creating powerful experiences that your clients and buyers and viewers SHARE. You have to not only create concrete transformation, but be willing to do it on a very high-visibility platform.</p><p> Now of course, you&rsquo;re probably not just one of these, but a combination&mdash;and there lies a clue to designing your unique road to brand authority. Are you an alchemist who pours over data like a rocket scientist? Use data&mdash;in a way that promotes transformation&mdash;in your platform.</p><p> Or maybe you started out as a journalist but got so intimately involved with a topic that you&rsquo;ve become its leading evangelist. Use your insight to spark conversations that spread the word.</p><p> The key is to  start . Because while authority doesn&rsquo;t come in a day, you never know which building block will become your break-through.</p>",

    "title": "How to Overcome Stereotype Threat: Looking Beyond Society's Expectations",
    "link": "how-to-overcome-stereotype-threat-looking-beyond-societys-expectations",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StevenHandel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Steven Handel  </u> </a></p><h3> We live in a world full of expectations.</h3><p> <br/> Society often expects us to act a certain way and be a certain way depending on who we are and what the &ldquo;norms&rdquo; are in a particular culture. These are the stereotypes we all have to face to some degree.</p><p> Stereotype threat is when we fear conforming to these negative stereotypes, which often creates stress and anxiety that ends up causing us to act in a way that makes that stereotype into a reality.</p><p> For example, an African American may experience stereotype threat when taking an SAT or IQ test, because of the stereotype that African Americans are less intelligent than other people.</p><p> This stereotype causes unnecessary stress and anxiety, which then leads an individual to under-perform, making the stereotype become true.</p><p> Stereotype threat is a very powerful force in our society. People&rsquo;s expectations of us can often become self-fulling, because we are unconsciously influenced to conform to these standards.</p><p> The more we give in to these stereotypes and let them occupy our mind, the more likely they are to influence us. Here are healthy steps to take to help reduce stereotype threat in your life.</p><h3> Find role models you can relate to</h3><p> <br/> One of the most effective ways to overcome stereotype threat is to find people who have already achieved similar goals to the ones you want to achieve.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also very important that your role models are people who also had to overcome the same stereotype you are facing.</p><p> For example, one recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://j.b.legal.free.fr/Blog/share/Expos%E9s%20M1/Stereotype%20threat%202.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  discovered that when women read articles about other successful women in architecture, law, and medicine, they perform better on a difficult math test. And another interesting  <a href=\"/category/personal-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study </a> discovered that when black Americans are reminded of Barack Obama, they perform better on a verbal exam.</p><p> This shows us that when we remind ourselves of people who have already overcome certain stereotypes, we become more confident in our own abilities, because we realize it&rsquo;s possible to overcome these stereotypes.</p><p> As an exercise, I highly recommend you  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theemotionmachine.com/make-a-list-of-people-you-admire-and-why\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   start a list of people you admire  </a> </u>  and save it somewhere. And as you discover new role models, add them to your list.</p><p> This &ldquo;role models&rdquo; list can become a very inspiring resource to have in the future whenever you need an extra boost in your confidence or motivation.</p><h3> Cultivate a growth mindset</h3><p> <br/> Another factor that has shown to overcome stereotype threat is having a &ldquo;growth mindset.&rdquo;</p><p> A &ldquo;growth mindset&rdquo; is when we believe that our intelligence and abilities can be improved on through time, work, and dedication. This is the opposite of a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; where we believe that our intelligence and abilities are something we are stuck with due to genes, environment, or other outside circumstances.</p><p> Many studies have shown the power of a growth mindset. For example, in one  <u>  study </u>  it was discovered that when blacks were told that intelligence is &ldquo;like a muscle&rdquo; that can be exercised, they reported greater enjoyment of the academic process, greater academic engagement, and obtained higher grade point averages (GPA&rsquo;s).</p><p> And in another study, it was found that when women, minorities, and low-income individuals were taught that their intelligence was malleable and changeable, they performed much better in school than those who were taught their academic difficulty was due to outside factors.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to remember that despite outside factors, we still have power and control over the results we get in life. And often times by re-focusing on our own individual effort, we can improve our intelligence and abilities.</p><p> By approaching our goals with a &ldquo;growth mindset,&rdquo; we are better able to overcome obstacles without getting too discouraged &ndash; because we better notice the &ldquo;small progress&rdquo; in our lives and continue building off of it.</p><p> For more, check out one of my recent articles about why you should  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theemotionmachine.com/why-you-should-believe-in-hard-work-over-genes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   believe in hard work over genes  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Reframe your performance anxiety</h3><p> <br/> One of the big reasons stereotype threat has such a negative influence is that it depletes mental resources.</p><p> People get so scared that they are going to fulfill a negative stereotype, so they spend more time worrying about that then focusing on the actual task at hand.</p><p> Naturally this is going to lead to worse performances.</p><p> However, some research such as this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2976617/\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  suggests that when individuals were told that their performance anxiety is actually a good thing &ndash; because it increases focus and motivation &ndash; they performed better on an exam (despite the stereotype threat).</p><p> Instead of trying to fight their anxiety or get rid of it, individuals were told that it was good for them. So instead of &ldquo;worrying about worrying,&rdquo; individuals could just focus on completing the task. Any fear, worry, or concern they&rsquo;d experience was just seen as a positive motivator.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a great quote from the writer Steven Pressfield:</p><li> &ldquo;The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist.&rdquo;</li><p> In many ways, doing our best requires us to act in the face of our fears, not wait for them to go away completely.</p><h3> Affirm yourself and your self-worth</h3><p> <br/> Having high confidence and self-worth can be an important requirement in overcoming stereotype threat.</p><p> In one recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/10092/507/2/stereotype_threat_martens.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u> , women who were given a chance to write down their strengths or reflect on a past accomplishment showed improved performance on a math test, as well as a spatial awareness test.</p><p> Sometimes, we get too caught up in the &ldquo;negative&rdquo; things about ourselves that we forget about all the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; things about ourselves.</p><p> Reminding yourself of your positive characteristics can help boost your self-esteem, and do a great service in minimizing stereotype threat in the future.</p><p> This technique is especially useful if you can think of accomplishments that are related to the task you want to improve in.</p><p> For example, if you&rsquo;re someone wanting to perform better in a science class, it would be great if you can think of other times in your past when you did well in something science-related.</p><h3> Minimize identifying with labels</h3><p> <br/> At the end of the day, we are complicated people that rarely fit neatly into a single label.</p><p> Perhaps you identify strongly as a &ldquo;black woman,&rdquo; but certainly there is much more to your identity than simply your race and gender, right?</p><p> In fact, many times there is more diversity within a particular race or gender than there is across different races or gender. One black woman can be a very, very different person than another.</p><p> We often have many different social identities intertwined, and they are part of what make us unique as an &ldquo;individual.&rdquo;</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"/category/personal-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Studies  </a> </u>  show that sometimes putting less emphasis on a particular &ldquo;social identity&rdquo; can be an effective way to reduce stereotype threat.</p><p> For example, by reminding individuals of other aspects of their identity that are irrelevant to a negative stereotype (hobbies, personal interests, or beliefs) they are less likely to be affected by stereotype threat regarding their race or gender.</p><p> This is because the identity associated with the stereotype becomes less salient in the person&rsquo;s mind &ndash; it&rsquo;s not emphasized as the absolute &ldquo;core&rdquo; of their being. The person is reminded that they are complex and multifaceted.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re interested in reading more about this concept, check out my article  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theemotionmachine.com/dont-label-yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   don&rsquo;t label yourself  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Pretend you&rsquo;re your future self</h3><p> <br/> One of the most powerful attitudes to take in your life is to act as if you are already your future self.</p><p> Often there&rsquo;s no better way to look beyond society&rsquo;s expectations and overcome stereotype threat than to set your own standards &ndash; based on your own expectations for yourself in the future.</p><p> Take a moment and imagine: &ldquo;How would my ideal future self think and act if I had already achieved the type of goals I want to achieve?&rdquo;</p><p> Playing pretend can help you see yourself in new ways &ndash; ways which you may have not thought about yourself previously.</p><p> This can be a huge help because it can often bring you closer to thinking and acting in new ways that serve your goals, rather than work against them.</p><p> When you do this, you&rsquo;re also expanding your sense of &ldquo;identity&rdquo; outside of ways that conform to stereotype threat.</p><p> You can learn more about this attitude in my article  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theemotionmachine.com/start-living-as-your-future-self\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   start living more as your future self  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tenetpartners\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Russ Napolitano  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Customer experience might be all the buzz these days, but is it really anything new? Coca-Cola&rsquo;s contour bottle has been creating the ultimate in customer experience for 100 years. </strong></p><p> There is a lot of talk these days about customer experience and how in order for brands to be successful they must create the ultimate customer experience across all touchpoints. We all know that basic marketing has moved beyond the 4P&rsquo;s - product, price, place and promotion. While the 4P&rsquo;s still serve as the marketing foundation, we have seen how the influence and the integration of technology and social media have significantly impacted how marketers think about the 4P&rsquo;s.</p><p> Achieving the ultimate customer experience comes in all forms and is the best way for brands to keep their customers engaged throughout every step of the brand journey. And this holds true whether we are talking about B2B, B2C or CPG companies, brands, products and/or services. So what exactly do we mean by Customer Experience or (CX)? Wikipedia defines Customer Experience (CX) as: the sum of all experiences at various touchpoints a customer has with a supplier of goods and/or services over the duration of their relationship with that supplier, good and/or service. This can include awareness, discovery, attraction, interaction, purchase, use, cultivation and advocacy. It can also be used to mean an individual experience over one transaction; the distinction is usually clear in context.</p><p> But is all this talk about customer experience really anything new or is it just that we now have more touchpoints where brands can impact the customer experience as a result of technology and social media versus let&rsquo;s say 100 years ago? Why 100 years you might ask? I just read  <a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/coca-colas-iconic-bottle-design-turns-100-105815004.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  an article </a> where the classic and iconic contoured-shaped Coca-Cola bottle is celebrating its 100th birthday this year. While Coca-Cola is planning on celebrating throughout 2015, the official date has been designated as November 16, 2015.</p><p> The brand is planning on throwing a huge global birthday centennial celebration with ad campaigns featuring the likeness of Ray Charles, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley&mdash;each drinking Coca-Cola straight from the contoured bottle. I immediately thought to myself WOW, how could this bottle possibly be 100 years old? What foresight the marketers and packaging engineers and designers had in creating such a bottle and to have it patented no less. Not only has this bottle shape became one of the most well-known global icons in branding history, but its shape has also created one of the most lasting and memorable customer experiences &mdash; an experience that provides Coca-Cola with a unique point-of-difference versus any other soda brand and every Coca-Cola customer with a personal experience with each purchase and consumption. After all, who doesn't have a heightened experience drinking Coca-Cola from its 8 fl. oz. contoured bottle versus a can?</p><p> Personally, when I see Coke&rsquo;s iconic bottle, I am immediately transported back in time to when I was a young boy putting change in the Coke machine waiting in anticipation to make my selection and listening for the bottle to quickly (and hopefully, safely without getting stuck) make its way down the channel for me to grab, pop open and take that first sip. For me, the customer experience started from the moment I shook quarters loose from my piggybank, rode my bike to the nearest convenience store, reached deep into my pockets and put quarters into the machine. Talk about the ultimate in customer experience. I can still envision this experience like it was yesterday even though it was actually over 40 years ago. I even have a Coca-Cola contoured bottle proudly displayed on a shelf of collectable packaging in my home office.</p><p> I want to wish a Happy 100th Birthday to Coca-Cola&rsquo;s contour bottle. Thanks for the memories and the ultimate customer experience your bottle shape has bestowed upon millions around the globe and will undoubtedly continue to do so for many generations to follow. You should be applauded for being ahead of the times in designing a shape that resulted in one of the most memorable customer experiences in branding history.</p><p> Can you think of any other brands, products and/or services that may have been ahead of its time in creating a unique customer experience?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AHAwriters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Shane Wolfsmith  </u> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s a strange time in the world of marketing. Digital technology has changed the way consumers behave, while the content marketing era has changed the way brands engage&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all happening at lightning speed. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s stop kidding ourselves. </strong>  The fact is, most people don&rsquo;t care if brands exist. Worldwide, the majority of people wouldn&rsquo;t blink if  <u>  73% of brands </u>  disappeared overnight. People care about what brands do and who they are, versus what they have to sell or offer. Brands need to extend their value with content that feels meaningful, that people can act on and that makes them feel smarter and more interesting for having read or shared it. <br/> <br/> <strong>  On-demand brands. </strong>  The strategy of interruption doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. We can&rsquo;t simply stop people in their tracks, present them with an idea and expect them to remember or care. There are too many other bright, shiny reasons out there for people to ignore, delete, fast-forward or click away. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Inclusion is key. </strong>  With every brand trying to tell a story, the challenge is to build brand narratives around the people you&rsquo;re trying to reach. Give them irresistible ways to become part of your story, add their own experiences to it and then spread the word. <br/> <br/> Here are three instances of brands we think are getting it right. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Humor done well resonates. </strong> <br/> Authenticity is key to building trust, and trust is a key ingredient to building a genuine relationship. If done right (and we admit it&rsquo;s hard to do), a sure-fire way to create a connection to&mdash;and therefore interest in&mdash;your brand is to show your sense of humor. Inviting people to participate in an inside joke makes them feel like they get you, and they will appreciate that you&rsquo;ve made them laugh.</p><p> <strong>  Newcastle </strong> <br/> Check out Newcastle&rsquo;s approach to  <u>  Super Bowl advertising </u>  this year, which has been well received by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1332430/newcastle-brown-ale-its-no-bllocks-approach-big-game-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   practically everyone  </a> </u> .

Everything you do as a brand should prompt, engage and empower your audience.<br/><br/><strong> Apple</strong>It&rsquo;s no surprise that Apple tells its brand story well.

Apple excites audiences and prompts us to take our creativity by the reins and create something new.<br/>If you want people to start&mdash;and keep&mdash;craving your story, follow the lead from these relevant brands. When executed with intrigue and honesty, your brand story can spark true interest and action.",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  When you&rsquo;re tired life isn&rsquo;t much fun. </strong> You feel lousy and you don&rsquo;t get very much accomplished. The worst part is, you don&rsquo;t have the energy to do anything about your situation. You&rsquo;ve run out of fuel and there&rsquo;s no filling station in sight.</p><p> Thank God I don&rsquo;t have many days like that, but when I do, I&rsquo;ve learned to ease off.  <u>  <a href=\"http://kubassek.com/learn-how-to-take-a-break/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I stop and take a break  </a> </u> . I take time to let my body and mind heal itself. I then get some exercise and generally I feel my energy returning.</p><p> People on a mission are good at ignoring their body&rsquo;s signals &mdash; much of their lives is spent training their minds to be more efficient and productive, and in the process ignore the warning signs of fatigue. Fatigue is not to be ignored. Tiredness is a warning sign that you have not been properly maintaining your body.</p><p> What happens next is we end up in burnout because we have inevitably run out of fuel. This happens when our mission is a higher priority than our maintenance. Listen to your body &mdash; your long-term health and sanity depend on it.</p><h3> Rest Heals &ndash; Activity Energizes</h3><p> <br/> Most people think they&rsquo;re tired because they don&rsquo;t rest enough. However, activity is the thing that energizes us provided our bodies have been properly maintained. A poorly maintained body likely needs a pit stop for refueling and perhaps repairs (healing) before it can be once again energized and activated.</p><p> Most people don&rsquo;t rest enough. It&rsquo;s not as high a priority as other things: waking early, getting things done, attending meetings, being sucked into the world of online connections, reading, and television. It is rest that allows the healing cycle to begin, so we can get active and finally have our energy return.</p><p> Sometimes chronic fatigue can be a sign of more serious problems. It could be a  <u>  <a href=\"http://kubassek.com/worry-overcome-prevent-five-steps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sign of depression  </a> </u>  or other medical issues. If it&rsquo;s a continuing problem, I&rsquo;d recommend getting checked out, just in case.</p><h3> How to Get Re-Energized</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re too tired to do anything else, take a nap if at all possible. If you can&rsquo;t take a nap, at the very least disconnect from digital devices. Computers and smartphones are powerful tools, but being on them for too long is tiring.</p><p> Disconnect. Go outside. Take a walk. Cancel an appointment or two if you can. Stretch. Get someone to massage your shoulders. Close your eyes for a few minutes. Breathe deeply.</p><p> These are small things you can do right away, and they will help you become more rested.</p><h3> Tips For A More Energized Life</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s a list of things that will help you energize your life:</p><p> <strong>  1. Go to bed earlier. </strong> If you&rsquo;re not getting at least 7 hours of sleep, you&rsquo;re probably getting too little. The key is to get at least 2 hours of sleep before midnight. Go to bed earlier &mdash; the internet will be fine without you for a few hours. Most people work 9-5, I prefer to sleep 9-5.</p><p> <strong>  2. Take stretch breaks. </strong> Sitting too long at the computer drains your energy. Get up and stretch every 20-25 minutes. Walk around for a minute or so. Move in any way you want &mdash; do push-ups, squats, jump up and down. Get the blood circulating any way you can.</p><p> <strong>  3. Exercise regularly. </strong> You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you to exercise, I&rsquo;m sure. But it&rsquo;s amazing how even a little exercise can help you to feel more energized throughout the day. A serious workout session can leave you exhausted &mdash; in which case you should rest &mdash; but shorter workouts leave you  just a little physically tired, but mentally you feel amazing.</p><p> <strong>  4. Ease off the caffeine. </strong> If you go cold turkey with caffeine you&rsquo;ll have even less energy. But cutting back a little at a time, while doing some of the things mentioned here, won&rsquo;t be bad. And you&rsquo;ll skip the afternoon withdrawal, which can ruin half your day. If you feel tired from drinking less caffeine take a short nap.</p><p> <strong>  5. Be more balanced. </strong> Most people believe they are tired from doing too many things. However, as I say in my book &ldquo; <a href=\"http://kubassek.com/books/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Five F-Word That Will Energize Your Life </a> &ldquo;, there may be too many things you are not doing. Some things you may need to begin doing are: drink more water, rest after lunch, exercise at least 3 times a week, take a break from your computer every 20-25 minutes. You get the idea.</p><p> <strong>  6. Focus on one task at a time. </strong> While most people think they are multi-tasking, in truth that&rsquo;s mental juggling. And there&rsquo;s only so much you can do in a day. Try doing one thing at a time and being fully present while doing that task. It&rsquo;s less tiring mentally, and it can make anything you do more enjoyable. Life is less tiring when you single-task.</p><p> <strong>  7. Drink up. </strong> Dehydration is actually a huge factor that most people don&rsquo;t realize is making them tired. Drink water throughout the day. You don&rsquo;t really need 8 glasses of water (we get some in food and other drinks), but drinking more water doesn&rsquo;t hurt. If your pee isn&rsquo;t a light yellow, or even clear in color, you&rsquo;re not very well hydrated.</p><p> <strong>  8. Freshen up. </strong> Sometimes a quick cold shower in the afternoon or evening can be refreshing. Wash your face. You&rsquo;ll feel like a &lsquo;new woman&rsquo;, as my brother Dave says.</p><p> <strong>  9. Work on something you&rsquo;re excited about. </strong> If you&rsquo;re passionate about your work, you&rsquo;ll feel energized. If you don&rsquo;t really care about your work, it will be a drag and it will feel like it drains the energy out of you.</p><p> <strong>  10. Back off on the booze.  </strong> If you want to have some energy left in you after your evening meal you may need to cut out that second glass of wine with dinner.</p><br/><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Great+mission+and+poor+maintenance+is+the+recipe+for+burnout.+--+Ben+Kubassek&amp;via=benkubassek&amp;related=benkubassek&amp;url=http://kubassek.com/are-you-tired-of-being-tired/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Great mission and poor maintenance is the recipe for burnout. &mdash; Ben Kubassek</a>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Ekaterina Walter </u></p><p> <strong>  A loyal customer of more than five years has an issue with one of your products. </strong> She tweets at your brand, hoping for a quick resolution. Your community manager replies, providing her with the email address of your customer care department. But when the customer contacts you, your system sends her the typical automated &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be back to you in the somewhat near future&rdquo; message. Unsatisfied, she picks up the phone. After being &ldquo;ping-ponged&rdquo; from one department to the next, she&rsquo;s finally connected to a live agent. This person, however, informs her that she&rsquo;ll have to stop by a physical store to resolve the issue.</p><p> When this frustrated customer walks into your store, does the clerk at the door know about her rather long and arduous journey? Does the store associate know this customer might never come back again?</p><p> This is the reality facing many companies today. And this problem will only get worse if businesses continue to operate per usual.</p><h3> Here is the issue.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Most companies rely on function-based technologies. </strong> There is a marketing cloud, a customer service cloud, a sales cloud &ndash; the list goes on. Each one supports a specific internal function within a large enterprise.</p><p> Customers, however, are need-focused. They couldn&rsquo;t care less about how a brand&rsquo;s internal functions operate. They don&rsquo;t care if they reach the marketing department, or customer service department, or any other department for that matter. They just want their issues solved and needs addressed.</p><p> They expect a brand to have all the necessary information (complete and available) to provide support in the way that&rsquo;s most convenient to them, the customer. Furthermore, they want brands to go above and beyond basic customers service standards. They and expect not only to be served, but to be delighted.</p><p> <strong>  Today&rsquo;s customers expect nothing short of a remarkable experience. </strong></p><p> What defines a good customer experience, you ask? According to <a href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/john_dalton/14-11-03-qa_with_rodney_prezeau_svp_affluent_client_experience_charles_schwab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Forrester  </u> </a>  Research, customers measure experiences based on the following three qualities:</p><li>      effectiveness (customers get value from the experience)</li><li>      ease of use (customers get value without difficulty)</li><li>      and emotion (customers feel good about the experience) <br/>  </li><h3> Are you delivering customer experiences that meet all these qualifications?</h3><p> <br/> I am pretty certain the answer is no. But soon, you won&rsquo;t have a choice in the matter. In fact, <a href=\"http://blogs.gartner.com/laura-mclellan/10-proof-points-why-customer-experience-is-the-next-big-thing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Gartner  </u> </a>  estimates that by 2016, 89% of businesses will differentiate primarily on customer experience.</p><p> That is why the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/experience-cloud-overview/?utm_source=ekaterina&amp;utm_medium=inc&amp;utm_content=whitepaper-pdf&amp;utm_campaign=Experience-Cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Experience Cloud  </a> </u>  is the future of digital transformation. It&rsquo;s the key to moving from channel-dependent technologies to a customer-first, silo-busting, experience-driven world.</p><p> Experience Cloud is an infrastructure that allows brands to create valuable, frictionless experiences for their customers. It is the technology that will build bridges between internal departments/functions &ndash; e.g. marketing, customer service, sales, PR, IR, HR &ndash; in a meaningful way to allow for a 360-degree view of the customer.</p><p> A marketing cloud isn&rsquo;t enough anymore. Neither is a sales cloud, or a customer service cloud for that matter.</p><p> If businesses truly seek to achieve digital transformation and succeed at omni-channel marketing, they&rsquo;ll need an end-to-end infrastructure that spans across the entire customer journey. Digital transformation &ndash; engaging digital consumers at every touchpoint in the customer experience lifecycle &ndash; requires three unification pillars: unified customer profiles, unified analytics, and a unified brand voice.</p><p> That is what the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/experience-cloud-overview/?utm_source=ekaterina&amp;utm_medium=inc&amp;utm_content=whitepaper-pdf&amp;utm_campaign=Experience-Cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Experience Cloud  </a> </u>  is all about.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Yesterday evening, I attended a gathering of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.oen.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Oregon Entrepreneurs Network  </a> </u> . The event, referred to as a PubTalk&trade;, featured a presentation by Benjamin Bohannon, co-founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://ssekodesigns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sseko Designs  </a> </u>  and Ian Lombard, Managing Director of Skyline Capital Partners, a venture capital firm and early investor in Sseko. You may have heard of Sseko Design. They were featured on Shark Tank in February, 2015 and have received considerable media attention, largely because of the company&rsquo;s compelling mission.</p><p> Sseko makes shoes, sandals and handbags at facilities in Uganda using responsibly sourced material from providers in East Africa. What sets Sseko apart is a business model designed from the ground up to serve a social cause. They employ high potential women who would ordinarily never get the chance to realize their potential and use company revenues to fund their college educations.</p><p> Sounds like a great model for a nonprofit, right? Well this is a serious business with real world expectations for delivering a return to its shareholders. Ian praised Sseko not just because of its noble mission, but because of the soundness of the business. This is a for-profit enterprise with big ambitions whose social agenda is integral to its value proposition. To paraphrase Benjamin, in the 21st century, purpose creates value.</p><p> <strong>  This concept &ndash; Purpose Creates Value &ndash; resonated deeply with me and as far as I could tell, everyone else in the room. In a world where we&rsquo;re smothered with noise and seemingly limitless access to more stuff, what stands out for us as humans and consumers is purpose &ndash; a sense that the choices we make can and should make the world a better place.  </strong></p><p> The truth of this concept is reinforced by research conducted by MIT for the Federal Reserve wherein Purpose is observed to be a more potent motivator than money in tasks requiring anything more than rudimentary cognitive skills. The study&rsquo;s focus was on workplace compensation and motivation, but I believe the power of purpose as described in the research is equally applicable to our motives when we shop, donate or volunteer. </p><p> I&rsquo;ve been writing lately about companies that I describe as Generous Enterprises. These are companies of purpose. The profit motive is still present. But transcending that motive is an abiding desire to make life better for their employees and their customers. For Sseko&rsquo;s investors and customers, the opportunity to support a valuable social cause while getting a great pair of shoes makes Sseko a better, more valuable choice.</p><p> Last week, I had the privilege of working with a group of business people in the wealth management industry who are merging their businesses into a single entity. I was introduced to the group by one of its members, a former colleague whose startup I helped support, to guide them in the process of transforming their four brands into one.</p><p> I love this kind of work, because I get to explore all that&rsquo;s best about a business. Why they do it; the obstacles they&rsquo;ve overcome; the values and principles that animate them; how what they do affects the people they serve.</p><p> The group talked at length about their clients. They shared stories about their clients&rsquo; experiences with the firm. We talked about clients&rsquo; fears and aspirations and the deep sense of responsibility each member of the group felt toward the people he served.</p><p> <strong>  This was a particularly rewarding experience for me because this group gets it. It&rsquo;s not just that they understand how important it is for their new business to have a cohesive brand narrative. They view their lives, careers and company as serving a higher purpose. And part of that higher purpose is to liberate their clients to pursue lives of purpose too. </strong></p><h3> I love that!</h3><p> <br/> Imagine the kind of experience a company with a motive like this delivers to its clients. This is big, it penetrates every aspect of the organization, and it&rsquo;s real. This simple statement sets the stage for how these professionals will operate their business, communicate with their clients, engage with their community and plan for growth and sustainability.</p><p> I have written at length about the importance of viewing marketing though a wide-angle lens. It&rsquo;s much, much bigger than ads or logos or slogans. It&rsquo;s about who you are, what you stand for and the difference you want to make in the world. Companies like Sseko Design and the firm I am working with get that. Their stories attract attention and fire the imagination because they&rsquo;re bigger than mere products and services. Indeed, as Benjamin Bohannon of Sseko Designs asserts, in the 21st century purpose creates value.</p><p> Are there companies you admire because of their social activism? How does their social agenda affect you as a consumer? Do you agree with me that companies with a purpose are better positioned for success in today&rsquo;s marketplace?</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Robo-advisers, direct marketing, 24/7 online transaction facilities, product kiosks and over the counter solutions to shoppers at supermarkets&hellip;these are all choices for financial products today.  Naturally these new methods of providing financial solutions challenge traditional incumbent business models, and many advisers hold the view that professional financial advice is essential for all consumers.</p><h3> Is that true though?</h3><p> <br/> For example: The 23 year old just entering the workforce who is bright and disciplined, carefully saving a percentage of each pay, and with no dependents or liabilities to speak of&hellip;..they have fairly simple financial needs, right?  I know we can make a good argument that getting a comprehensive financial plan at that stage can potentially help set them up for life and probably early retirement, but do they need it?  Surely that is a &ldquo;want&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;need&rdquo;?</p><p> I have found myself increasingly using the following diagram when working with many advisers trying to figure out how to adapt their practices to todays different consumer needs and choices.  There is a clear area of opportunity for advisers, and clearly there are areas where advisers will struggle to differentiate, let alone compete.</p><h3> This is the typical consumers financial advice, or financial products, needs over time:</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"258\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1-complex-advice.png\" width=\"610\"/></p><p> While it is not absolute it can be viewed as generally correct for the majority of consumers.  Early in life their needs are few and relatively simple.  Later in life their needs are relatively few (compared to prior working years), and more often than not the ongoing advice is extremely limited in scope or fairly simple.</p><p> The mainstream advice area is naturally where life gets more complex for consumers, as it is where research, process, knowledge, information, strategy and choice come together to create value in customers lives.  Of course this is where most advisers find themselves operating with most of their existing clients today &ndash; those who are still in the complex years and who are also (usually) time poor.  The adviser is valued by those clients generally.</p><p> At the extremes it really is becoming the domain of the direct transactors or commoditised product providers.  Lowest possible costs together with highest possible convenience factors together with simple product structure equals an easy and instant &ldquo;just add boiling water&rdquo; solution.  Advisers would generally be foolish to try and compete in that space.</p><p> Most advice businesses will come to recognise this (if they haven&rsquo;t already) and will direct their marketing efforts at gathering more of the consumers who are currently living lives of complexity.  Those same consumers are being bombarded with over 3,000 advertising messages per day, are already time poor, and have rapidly improving privacy screens and filters.   <strong>  They are going to be tough to get through to aren&rsquo;t they? </strong></p><h3> The greatest opportunity to acquire new customers lies in the times of disruption in consumers lives.  </h3><p> <br/> The times of transition from simplicity to complexity, or vice versa.  At the front end where simple needs are becoming more complex there is the opportunity to gain clients who will grow.  At the other end of the scale there is the opportunity to provide more transactional services perhaps, but still high value.  Both types of business can grow a firm rapidly, and quite probably more easily than competing in the crowded middle market.</p><p> <strong>  The consumers in transition are the ones who want advice most. </strong>  They are the ones who will place a higher value on the professionals who can simplify the complexity.  They are the area of greatest opportunity in my view.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Is it possible we are the biggest group of victims of groupthink on the planet?</h3><p> <br/> The theme has popped up recently in a number of my coaching engagements. I have found myself referring to marketing and management books from outside the financial services business when addressing issues advisors are dealing with. I referenced the works in conversations with clients and found those advisors had not heard of them before. Given the number of business books published in a year, that&rsquo;s not overly surprising. But it got me thinking.</p><p> It occurred to me that virtually all the articles published in our trade journals and the studies conducted in our industry attempt to find the best solutions to the pressing issues of the day by asking the most successful advisors how they do it. Okay, fair enough. If you want to copy someone else it makes sense to emulate the ones who are getting the best results. But what if no one in the industry really has it nailed. What if someone in a different business (or even an entire other industry) has found a much better approach?</p><p> Take my area of expertise as an example &ndash; marketing. We all know that attracting referrals is the most effective way financial advisory firms market their services. Is that because referral marketing is the best possible way or could it be because financial advisors generally are just so awful at marketing? (I happen to believe that referral marketing is at least the most cost-effective although, especially watching the growth of social media, it may not be the best. And the vast majority of advisors are just awful at marketing, so those industry surveys in search of the best marketing strategies for advisory firms that simply poll advisors on how they do it always make me smile. And cringe.)</p><p> Why don&rsquo;t we see reviews of books from the general business press reviewed in our trade journals? Why don&rsquo;t we hear of advisors or experts taking a new management or marketing idea from a bestseller and trying it out in an advisory firm?</p><h3> How many opportunities are we missing by not taking a broader view?</h3><p> <br/> Being creative is hard. Beyond the opportunity to discover ideas professionals in other industries are trying out, looking at a problem and its solution in a different context can make it easier for your mind to be flexible. One of my favorite &ldquo;business&rdquo; books is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Better-Surgeons-Performance-Atul-Gawande/dp/0312427654/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Better  </a> </u>  by Atul Gawande. And it&rsquo;s not a business book. The subtitle is A Surgeon&rsquo;s Notes on Performance. Gawande&rsquo;s question is if all doctors have the same techniques, treatment methodologies, medicines, and tools, why is it that outcomes can be radically different for the same condition between one institution and another? And then he proceeds to examine some of the principles that affect the performance of health institutions through a series of vignettes. It is a capitvating book. It&rsquo;s a great question for financial advisors as well. Contemplating the question of managing client outcomes from totally outside the financial services environment made it a lot easier to get creative inspiration from it. He takes that approach in his subsequent book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   The Checklist Manifesto  </u> </a> . The World Health Organization presented him with a challenge to improve surgical outcomes around the world. In exploring the value of using checklists in the surgical suites, he draws lessons from their many origins and implementations across many industries, from construction to air travel. All those other fields inform his utilization of them in medicine.</p><h3> Do you want to find a better way to influence clients&rsquo; behavior?</h3><p> <br/> I am a lot less interested in what even the most successful advisors do then I am to try out the ideas from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Switch  </a> </u>  by Chip and Dan Heath or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Influence-How-Anyone-Anything--Fast/dp/0316083348/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Instant Influence  </a> </u>  by Michael Pantalon. Want to get some kind of idea what the World Wide Web and social media is affecting how we market our services? Some of the most interesting ideas are in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Sale-Digitally-Marketing-Prospect/dp/0789751356/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Invisible Sale  </a> </u>  by Tom Martin even though the book makes no mention of financial services.</p><p> Would you be interested in exploring how we might bring more ideas from the popular business press into study groups, mastermind groups, or group coaching situations? What are some of your favorite recent titles from outside financial services? I would love to hear some of your opinions. Let me know what you think in the comments below. If you are interested, maybe it is a conversation worth continuing.</p><p> <strong>  The End of the Elevator Pitch:  </strong> I have created a short guide with 10 tips on putting together a great positioning statement for your company.

    "link": "lets-talk-the-glue-of-great-relationships",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  LOL, EOD, BRB, TY, and YW might be key elements of the way we communicate in a texting, emailing, social media-obsessed world </strong> , but they don&rsquo;t make for high quality communication or conversation. With communication becoming more and more diluted by technology, there is a higher than ever importance of valuing great conversation&mdash;an essential element in building strong, mutually beneficial, and profitable relationships for financial professionals.</p><h3> Conversations are the building blocks of relationships.</h3><p> <br/> Without them, we form relationships that are devoid of substance. Unfortunately, we live in a world where the modern MO seems to be more email and less talk. People either think they don&rsquo;t have the time or don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to take the time to have real conversations with each other. But for financial professionals who want to create truly beneficial relationships, it may be helpful to take some time to stop emailing, walk away from the computer, and connect with someone one-on-one through a great conversation. </p><h3> Here are 6 reasons for re-mastering the art of conversation.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s the glue of great relationships.  </strong> <br/> You can email someone regularly, but it is only during a real conversation that a bond with them actually begins to strengthen. Think about this in terms of your professional life. Who do you trust more? The wholesaler who you meet with a few times a year or the one who only communicates via email? Sure, you might enjoy doing business with both of them, but when it comes right down to it, your relationship with the wholesaler you regularly speak to is probably stronger.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s the only way to see what someone is saying.  </strong> <br/> Face-to-face conversation is the only way to take in the total message someone is sending. It allows you to take their inflection, emotion, and physical gestures into account along with what they are actually saying. It also allows you to show that person that you are listening and truly value what they have to say.  <br/> <br/> Your face, eyes, and body language allow you to give a range of emotions that indicate whether you are following what the speaker is saying. Your face actively captures information. A simple nod of the head or a simple &lsquo;uh-huh&rsquo; help you acknowledge that you are really listening to what they have to say.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s an opportunity-making skill.  </strong> <br/> Being a conversationalist can lead to great opportunities. Cross-selling new products to your current clients rarely happens through email. More often than not opportunities are agreed upon by a client during a phone or in-person conversation. In your social life, if you want to ask someone on a date or even just make a new friend, you&rsquo;re going to have to be able to talk to them. Life&rsquo;s opportunities are sealed with conversation. <br/> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s a great way to invest in others.  </strong> <br/> The act of listening&mdash;the other half of having a great conversation&mdash;shows people you care. Have you ever been around someone who just wants to listen to you, wants to hear all about your day, or your recent trip? Someone who is truly interested in you? You might not find them very often, but when you do, they really stick out. When you speak with someone and listen to what they have to say, you are showing them you value them. <br/> <br/> It is not a requirement to be the most outgoing person in the room. If you&rsquo;ve been using your shyness or lack of eloquence as an excuse for relying on technology for a lot of your communication, now&rsquo;s the time to stop. Being outgoing is not a requirement for participating in or initiating a great conversation. The only requirements are that you be authentic and show that you value what the other person has to say. You don&rsquo;t have to say anything profound. You don&rsquo;t have to impress them with your every word. You simply have to participate, actively listen, and be open and honest in what you say. <br/> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s the best way to mend a broken relationship.  </strong> <br/> There are some situations that should only be handled via a conversation. Mending a broken relationship is one of those situations. When there is an issue with a client, the best course of action is to have a conversation on the phone or in person - even when the conversation might be uncomfortable. I know several financial advisors that have made it standard practice to schedule a face to face meeting with an unhappy client. And, believe it or not, they will often create additional sales by simply getting in front of the unhappy client! It happened because the client has an opportunity to share how they feel, see that you care, and remember why they decided to do business with you in the first place.   <br/> <br/> <strong>  If you&rsquo;ve lost an appreciation for the art of conversation, it&rsquo;s time to re-open that door. Behind it are stronger relationships, more opportunities, and a more satisfying way of running your business. </strong></p> ",

    "title": "10 Questions to Ask Before Hiring a Marketing Agency",
    "link": "10-questions-to-ask-before-hiring-a-marketing-agency",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoCommPR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Danielle Cyr  </u> </a></p><h3> Deciding to contract with a third-party firm for marketing and PR services is a big decision.</h3>Not only do you need a partner with whom you can build a trusting, long-standing partnership, you need an agency who excels in three key areas &ndash; strategy, creativity and execution. This winning combination will allow your company or cause to stand out from the crowd and generate tangible marketing ROI. How do you choose the right marketing firm? Start by asking these key questions:<strong> 1. What do you know about my industry?</strong>While the decision of whether to contract with a marketing agency that focuses exclusively on one industry or serves multiple industries is driven by the prospective client&rsquo;s wants and needs, it&rsquo;s important to know that you are contracting with a firm that has a proven track record in the area (industry or service) you are looking to secure their support.  If you are looking to work with an agency where you will be the exclusive account they service in your industry, let that be known up front. Some agencies do not offer exclusives, while others may have a minimum investment tied to exclusivity.<strong> 2. How are you different from your competitors?</strong>No two marketing agencies are alike. From how client teams are structured, to the types of accounts they handle, to their internal culture, there are a lot of differentiators to be considered. Having already done your homework to determine which firms you wanted to interview, you likely have a sense of what makes each agency unique, but it is still an important question to ask. If the agency tells you first-hand that X makes them unique and you haven&rsquo;t found any mention of X in your research, probe a little bit deeper. You want to be sure you gather as much intelligence as possible to make an informed decision about which agency is best suited to serve as your marketing partner.<strong> 3. Who will be on my account team?</strong>Knowing who you will be working with is an absolute must. We&rsquo;re often asked how we choose the account teams for various clients and there are a number of factors which inform this decision.  Representative considerations include skill set and industry experience. Depending on the size and structure of the agencies you are interviewing, the people with whom you interface during the sales process may not be the people who will be servicing your account. It is critical to get this question answered early on in the agency hiring process to ensure you can build a positive, long-standing relationship with your soon-to-be marketing team.<strong> 4. How much time will I need to invest in working with a marketing agency?</strong>Regardless of whether you or a colleague will serve as the agency&rsquo;s primary point of contact, it is important to know how much time you will need to invest. Typically, there is a heavier investment of time made by the client at the onset of the relationship as strategies are built and workflows are established.<strong> 5. How often will we hear from you?</strong>While many agencies provide monthly reporting, you&rsquo;ll want to know what the interim touchpoints will look like and when they will occur. If you want to hear from your marketing agency via a weekly phone call, have that conversation up front. If you want twice weekly email check-ins, make it known. You want to be sure you are choosing a marketing partner whose communication practices are well-aligned with your wants and needs.<strong> 6. How does the onboarding process work?</strong>Onboarding processes vary widely not only by agency, but by client and scope of work. Onboarding at Co-Communications typically starts with a discovery meeting, and depending on the nature of the engagement, may then move into a research phase. For more details about onboarding with a PR/marketing agency, <u> <a href=\"https://cocommunications.com/2015/01/21/how-does-client-onboarding-work-at-a-prmarketing-agency/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  click here </a></u>.<strong> 7. How will you measure results?</strong>Success metrics should be uniquely tailored to an individual client&rsquo;s goals and objectives. They should be aligned with the overall business strategy and take into consideration all tactics being employed (within marketing and beyond) to achieve those objectives. It is important to find a marketing agency that will work with you to set measurable objectives and who has the tools and resources available to effectively measure outcomes against these goals. That said, there will likely be data (website analytics, form submissions, lead generation data) that you, the client, may need to provide to your agency. The more integrated the metrics, the easier it will be to quantify success.<strong> 8. How long will it take to see results?</strong>The time it takes for marketing to work is largely dictated by the tactics employed. For example, a marketing program that includes public relations, in particular media relations, and is aiming to garner national press coverage will not yield overnight results. A digital tactic such as email marketing or Facebook advertising, however, may generate results more quickly. It all depends on the messaging, the medium and the call-to-action.<strong> 9. What if it doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong>When searching for a marketing agency, you want to find a partner who is both strategic and nimble. What does that mean? You want a research-informed roadmap to guide your marketing program but you also want to be able to make tweaks and refinements to seize timely opportunities. You also want to be able reallocate resources to the strategies and tactics that are yielding the greatest ROI. With the appropriate success metrics in place, it will be relatively easy to identify what is working well, what needs improvement and how best to move forward.<strong> 10. How much will it cost?</strong>The cost of hiring a marketing agency is driven by the scope of work. Agencies will outline the scope of work/contract deliverables in their proposals and the suite of services they list should be customized based on your objectives. If you have aggressive goals and a limited budget, you may need to <u> <a href=\"https://cocommunications.com/2015/03/04/5-tips-for-prioritizing-your-marketing-budget/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  prioritize your marketing budget </a></u>.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Sam Lewis </u></p><p> The following is an extract from the eBook \"Attract and Retain: A Content Marketing Guide for Growing Fiduciary Businesses\".  <a href=\"http://regismedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Download it here. </a></p><p> Over the last couple of posts, we&rsquo;ve seen  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/blog/how-financial-advisers-can-benefit-from-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what content marketing is  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/blog/the-business-case-for-content-marketing-for-financial-planners-and-wealth-managers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   how it can help financial planners  </a> </u>  and evidence of how it can generate business. This next section contains 20 short hints and tips on where to start, and if you&rsquo;ve already got a content strategy, where to improve. To help, it's organised into order for the process so it's easier to find the information you need. </p><p> (Quick note: these tips have been edited from another of our eGuides,  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/resources/39-steps-successful-content-marketing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The 39 Steps to Successful Content Marketing  </a> </u> , written by my colleague Robin Powell. Have a look at it for a broader approach to content strategy).</p><h3> Getting Started</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Define objectives </strong> <br/> Your first step is to determine exactly what you want to achieve. Is it raising awareness, retaining existing clients or building a profile that&rsquo;s most important? Or is it purely about conversions and sales? Chances are it&rsquo;ll be a combination of things. But agreeing on what your priorities are from the outset is essential for success.</p><p> <strong>  2. Set targets </strong> <br/> The most important thing here is to be realistic. Research suggests that it takes between six and nine months for content marketing to start making a significant difference. Or as we saw with MeaningfulMoney TV, 18 months. Don&rsquo;t expect overnight success. But be specific - for example, you could aim for a number of page or video views per day after, say, six months and a year.</p><p> <strong>  3. Identify your audience </strong> <br/> Identify exactly who it is you want to target and find out how they negotiate social media. Ask yourselves what sort of content they&rsquo;d like to receive. Is it the informed investor, or the retail consumer? Is it financial directors in established institutions? Particularly think about the problems they&rsquo;re facing that you might provide an answer to. </p><p> <strong>  4. Produce a content calendar </strong> <br/> A content calendar laying out what content you&rsquo;ll publish when is essential. Factor in key events in your industry, such as institutional reports or the Autumn statement. If required, Google Docs provides editorial calendar templates and WordPress has a plug-in.</p><p> <strong>  5. Be consistent </strong> <br/> Decide on your niche and what sort of content you&rsquo;re going to produce on an on-going basis, and when you&rsquo;re going to publish it. Keep testing: if it works, stick to it. Your audience will come to expect consistently regular updates, so don&rsquo;t disappoint them.</p><h3> Choosing the medium</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  6. Involve your audience </strong> <br/> Don&rsquo;t talk at your audience; talk with them. Mention them in your blogs and videos; thank them for sharing your posts; act on their feedback. Ask them to write a guest blog, or interview them in a video or audio podcast.</p><p> <strong>  7. Interview an expert </strong> <br/> Interviewing an industry expert is an easy way to produce engaging content. Particularly ask them to address concerns and questions your audience has. Repurpose the content so that it has longevity. Turn it into a video - and perhaps a longer audio podcast - and provide the highlights in written form.</p><p> <strong>  8. Spread the word </strong> <br/> Post your content to multiple social media accounts. Depending on where your audience go, you should be sharing every post on Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and your Twitter account. And make it easy for people to share it via any of their accounts.</p><h3> Honing the message</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  9. Stop selling </strong> <br/> Content marketing ultimately will increase sales, but it&rsquo;s not a sales tool in itself. Start talking about how great your company is, and people will lose interest. Instead, focus on giving your audience information they want and need. Help them, don&rsquo;t sell to them.</p><p> <strong>  10. Feel the pain </strong> <br/> When planning content, think about the challenges facing your target audience. Get inside the minds of your customers&hellip; What problems are they having? What keeps them awake at night? Then produce content that addresses these pain points.</p><p> <strong>  11. Answer questions </strong> <br/> The hardest part of creating and curating regular content is coming up with ideas. Some of the most effective content is the type that addresses the questions that customers are asking. So listen to what your customers are asking. Look through industry forums. Every question provides potential for a new piece of content.</p><p> <strong>  12. Be part of the wider conversation </strong> <br/> Don&rsquo;t see including links to external sites as sending traffic away. People take you seriously when they see your information comes from a reputable source. No one has a monopoly on the best ideas. And quoting experts shows you&rsquo;re part of a wider conversation.</p><p> <strong>  13. Include calls to action </strong> <br/> Your content shouldn&rsquo;t be a sales or promotional tool. But do include calls to action - and vary them each time. For example, as well as urging people to phone or email, ask them to submit their details in return for premium content, or to share your content with others.</p><p> <strong>  14. Become an industry authority </strong> <br/> Establish yourselves as experts on your industry. Keep tabs on all the latest developments - and any emerging trends. Scan the latest RSS feeds, surveys and reports using tools such as Feedly - and conduct your own surveys to provide new insights.</p><h3> Finding the words</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  15. Don't overwrite </strong> <br/> When writing a blog or video script, don&rsquo;t write as if it&rsquo;s a formal report. Like Rick Deckard, people can spot if it&rsquo;s robotic and they will disengage. But don&rsquo;t make it too conversational either. Avoid jargon and flowery language. Write in plain English. Imagine you&rsquo;re writing for just one person. Help that person. Make an impact on them.</p><p> <strong>  16. Don't write for Google </strong> <br/> Although key words are important, don&rsquo;t get too hung up on them. Or worse, cram your posts with them. It&rsquo;s unreadable and utterly cynical. Write for your audience - not for SEO. Provide them with informative content and they&rsquo;re more likely to share it and remember you when they come to buy. That way you boost sales and your search engine rankings.</p><h3> Keeping going</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  17. Choosing quality over quantity </strong> <br/> Ideally you need both, but if you really have to choose, choose quality. It&rsquo;s particularly crucial in the B2B sector, where a few strong leads are preferable to scores of inferior ones. There&rsquo;s already plenty of content out there; quality will make yours stand out.</p><p> <strong>  18. Curate other people's content </strong> <br/> You don&rsquo;t need to produce all the content yourself. Curate the best content that others are putting out. Try using a curation tool like Scoop It, Storify or Spundge. Always credit the content creator and add your own comments instead of just sharing.</p><p> <strong>  19. Track the results </strong> <br/> Nothing will motivate you more than seeing the fruits of your labours. Another reason for tracking the impact of your content is that it shows you how to tweak future content to ensure it hits the spot. Google, YouTube and HootSuite all provide a wealth of useful analytics.</p><p> <strong>  20. Amplify </strong> <br/> There are some very effective online tools to help you spread your content far and wide - directories, syndicators, aggregators and publishers. It&rsquo;s worth checking out the likes of Alltop, Reddit and Stumbleupon, which will link back to your own website.</p><h3> The next steps</h3><p> <br/> This is the final post in a series of blogs looking at content marketing for growing fiduciary businesses. If you've enjoyed them and found them helpful, you can download the eBook that they've been taken from over at  <u>  <a href=\"http://regismedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Regis Media  </a> </u>  - simply scroll down to see the link.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  21st Century corporate governance is a busy job. </strong> Acting on behalf of shareholders, boards of directors are paying attention to an escalating list of risks and rewards from a firm&rsquo;s undertakings. Like many activities within any organization, &ldquo;the squeaky wheels get the grease.&rdquo; Other than in desperate situations such as &lsquo;turnarounds,&rsquo; culture seldom ranks as a pressing matter in the boardroom. That&rsquo;s a big mistake. </p><p> During my tenure as a CEO, my Board of Directors never posed questions pertaining to corporate culture. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised in the least. Jacobs Suchard Directors expected me to run their North American operation as an entrepreneurial enterprise, and as long as the returns were favorable, they assumed I was doing just that.</p><h3> Boards Pay Attention to Shareholder Value</h3><p> <br/> As with most Boards, their primary interest was shareholder value. As such they were keen to discuss the &lsquo;hard&rsquo; variables &ndash; profit margins, efficiencies, headcount, labor climate and strategic initiatives. Maybe it was the times; a quarter century ago, culture was beginning to come of age. And even though culture is a vital determinant of business performance, today&rsquo;s Boards fail to give it the attention it deserves.</p><p> That is not the case at Google, Zappos, Whole Foods, and several other new age companies. Envision Google without innovators, or Zappos cutting corners on customer service. Imagine Whole Foods selling processed foods loaded with saturated and trans-fats. This is difficult for us to do because of the cultural disconnect to what these organizations stand for.</p><h3> Founders Infuse Corporate Values</h3><p> <br/> Founders infuse corporate values. In the early days of Zappos, Tony Hsieh asked his employees to help define the company&rsquo;s culture. Ever since, employees submit a few paragraphs on what Zappos means to them. These musings are added to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zapposinsights.com/culture-book\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   culture book  </a> </u>  that is updated annually. Zappos gladly ships this book anywhere in the world at no cost. Has the Zappos culture improved business performance and shareholder value? Jeff Bezos thought so. In 2009,  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/02/amazon-closes-zappos-deal-ends-up-paying-1-2-billion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Amazon bought Zappos  </a> </u>  for $1.2 billion. Bezos wanted Hsieh to stay at the helm, for good reason. In 2013, Zappos continues to amaze under this culturally insightful leader.</p><p> John Mackey of Whole Foods understands culture. In 1986, he instituted a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-whole-foods-paychecks-are-public/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   policy  </u> </a>  whereby any employee can look up the salary and bonus of others, including the top management. Seemingly, if workers understood what types of performance and achievement earned certain people more money, he figured, perhaps they would be more motivated and successful, too. Mackey admits to being constantly questioned about salaries. &ldquo;People want to know why they aren&rsquo;t earning as much as someone else.&rdquo; Mackey tells them it&rsquo;s because &ldquo;that person is more valuable. If you accomplish what this person has accomplished, I&rsquo;ll pay you that, too.&rdquo;</p><p> When the founders are gone, the culture baton is passed down a long line of chief executives. These leaders are responsible for perpetuating &ldquo;the way&rdquo; or making changes depending on the market environment or the needs of the enterprise. Some do it well. Others do not. Boards can help. They determine that next line of CEOs and they keep an eye on corporate performance. Boards are charged with providing perspective and input into the long-term business strategy, imparting strategic direction to management, and identifying risk and overseeing mitigation. There&rsquo;s not a better way to deliver against these objectives than bringing insightful cultural discussions into the boardroom.</p>",

    "content": "<p> My first job out of college was a dead-end position as a Buyer at a fancy retail store in Arizona. I thought this would be the perfect position for me because&mdash;surprise, I loved to shop! Although I dreaded going to work everyday, I found myself wooed by the glamour of the position and the great discount on very expensive clothes.At first, I was enamored with the idea of being a fashion buyer&mdash;and I was successful by most people&rsquo;s standards. But I came to be miserable, because I was in a job that, ultimately, did not leave me feeling my life had either meaning or value. There was a voice inside that reminded me of the regret I would feel from living a life of mediocrity and it challenged me to uncover my full potential. In listening to that voice, I became an FBI agent and was continually placed in situations that stretched my abilities, but I also knew these challenges were moving me closer to a purpose that held both success and fulfillment for me.Peak performance and success are two sides of the same coin. Peak performance is linked to a concept known as &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-ebook/dp/B000W94FE6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400631775&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   flow  </u>  . </a> &rdquo; Flow is a state of mind during which we become so involved in what we&rsquo;re doing that the world seems to fade away and nothing else matters. When we&rsquo;re in a state of flow, times flies by, our focus becomes sharp, and we experience a loss of self-consciousness.We experience the flow of peak performance when we achieve a personal goal we&rsquo;ve set for ourselves. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphin\" target=\"_blank\">  runner&rsquo;s high </a> &rdquo; that we feel when we are following our heart&rsquo;s calling and truly engaged in activities that give us meaning and purpose.Peak performance is having the  <u>  mental toughness </u>  to be our best so we can be successful. The ultimate definition of success is  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   to realize our fullest potential so we can accomplish what we desire to accomplish  </u>  . </a>   Let&rsquo;s take a look at how you can increase your odds of success:</p><h3> 1. No Sugar-Coating&mdash;It All Starts with Honest Self-Evaluation</h3>Successful people are emotionally intelligent. They can not only accurately perceive the emotions of others, they are also adept at identifying and understanding their own emotions as well. They have a high level of self-awareness and are able to accurately assess information about their abilities, even when it is unflattering.Once you know yourself and your limits, you know exactly what you&rsquo;re afraid of and exactly how hard to push against it.If you are not willing to take a honest look at your abilities and identify where you need to improve, you will never move past your current circumstances. Those with self-knowledge do not worry when their radar comes up with something about themselves that is unflattering. The reason is because they are also acutely aware of their strengths.To become successful, it is essential to have accurate information about your abilities so you can learn more efficiently and effectively.<h3> 2. Don't Be Content with Mediocrity&mdash;Stretchtoward Peak Performance</h3>Unless you know your limits, you will not be able to prepare either your mind or your body to move past them. To move toward peak performance, you need to stretch your current skill level&mdash;but not so hard that you want to give up.Experts agree that this <u> <a href=\"/grow/leadership/4-ways-successful-people-move-toward-peak-performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  magic stretch is 4% greater than our skill </a></u>. For most of us, it&rsquo;s not much at all. However, it&rsquo;s important to keep that continual tension between stretch and skill if we want to move toward our peak performance.<h3> 3. Everything Starts as a Struggle</h3>This is the same whatever the learning cycle: we begin by overloading our brain with information. If you&rsquo;re an athlete, you will engage in serious physical training. If you&rsquo;re in marketing, you may begin with fact gathering. If you&rsquo;re a CEO, you may begin with a concentrated problem analysis.<u> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Breakout-Principle-Creativity-Performance-Productivity-ebook/dp/B000FBJGK4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400632063&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+breakout+principle\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  An important chemical change takes place in our brain during struggle </a></u>. Tensions rise, and frustrations, too. Adrenaline, cortisol, and norepinephrine are pumped into our system.How we handle negative feelings during this stage is critical. We&rsquo;re struggling to identify patterns and then repeating those patterns so our brain eventually no longer sees them as a series of steps to be taken but as a chunk of activity. Chunks simplify activities for the brain so it takes a very small bit of information and then predicts the outcome. Until this happens, however, we are awkward and uncomfortable. This is where many people give up and settle for mediocrity.<h3> 4. Relax and Remember There is a Light at the End of the Tunnel</h3><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Benson\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Researchers </u></a> have found that to move out of the struggle phase, it&rsquo;s important to move into a state of mind where you take your thoughts off the problem. Once you can find a way to relax in the midst of your struggle, the stress hormones in your brain start to decrease and the feel-good chemicals like dopamine start to kick in.This is why humor is so important in high-stress jobs. It can defuse an intense situation by letting the brain relax.Success is not a measure of how much money you make or the size of your house. It is knowing that, at the end of it, you have been brave enough to become the person you were truly meant to be.<strong> What we are is God&rsquo;s gift to us. what we become is our gift to God&mdash;Eleanor Powell</strong>",

    "title": "What Keeps Jamie Dimon Awake at Night?",
    "link": "what-keeps-jamie-dimon-awake-at-night",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "I&rsquo;ve written a lot about incumbents versus startups lately and noted with interest that Jamie Dimon&rsquo;s <u> <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/annual-report/2014/ar-introduction.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  annual letter </a></u> to JPMorgan shareholders picks up on this theme (not as a direct result I&rsquo;m sure?).  He talks about &ldquo;hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the ones you read about most are in the lending business, whereby the firms can lend to individuals and small businesses very quickly and &mdash; these entities believe &mdash; effectively by using Big Data to enhance credit underwriting.&rdquo;<h3> These are the ones of concern?</h3>Yes, because &ldquo;they are very good at reducing the &lsquo;pain points&rsquo; in that they can make loans in minutes, which might take banks weeks.&rdquo;Interesting.  Why does it take banks weeks?  He doesn&rsquo;t say.  The answer is because banks are laden with sedentary processes built in the last century for the physical distribution of paper in a localised network called the branch.  The branch was filled with human automatons who could manage transactions but not assess risk.  Risk is a Head Office function managed by specialists, who are trusted not to lend to idiots (hence the reason why we avoided a credit crisis!).  The hand off of fact-finding papers by automatons to enable specialists to work out whether the applicant was an idiot or not would take weeks.  Now, self-service forms online have replaced the automatons and automated systems have replaced the specialists.  That&rsquo;s why the new P2P providers can replace banks with instantaneous decision-making services at a fraction of the cost.  After all, a server for $1,000 is far cheaper than a specialist Head Office credit risk manager costing tens of $1,000s.As I blogged <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/07/banks-need-rock-star-coders-to-survive.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a while ago </a></u>, this is the reason why banks should fear the replacement startup companies more than the wrapper services.  It is also why Jamie Dimon not only underscores that the banks is &ldquo;going to work hard to make our services as seamless and competitive as theirs&rdquo; but, in a step further towards bank as value systems integrator, he states that JPMorgan &ldquo;also are completely comfortable with partnering where it makes sense.&rdquo;Will JPMorgan integrate Lending Club and Prosper into their credit risk operations and structures, and what does this to do margin, process and operations?  Good question and one that JPMorgan along with other banks are all trying to assess, as they have to face it: the day of stand-alone vertically integrated banking is over.<h3> That&rsquo;s demonstrated well in the payments world, that also gets a note in the letter.</h3>&ldquo;You all have read about Bitcoin, merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal look-alikes. Payments are a critical business for us &mdash; and we are quite good at it, but there is much for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques, and reduction of costs and 'pain points' for customers.&rdquo;Learning is a good thing to focus upon, and JPM along with their counterparties are doing just that.  It is why UBS, BBVA, NYSE, Intesa, Barclays and several other banks are investing in cryptocurrency startups and supporting new payments models.  The thing is that they cannot do this effectively if banks are hamstrung by heritage.  As Dimon states:  &ldquo;some payments systems, particularly the ACH system controlled by NACHA, cannot function in real time and, worse, are continuously misused by free riders on the system.&rdquo;Free riders? Who could they be?  &ldquo;PayPal and PayPal look-alikes&rdquo;?<h3> So what are you going to do about JD?</h3>Well, I answered that <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/07/banks-need-rock-star-coders-to-survive.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a while ago </a></u> but, in case you missed, it JPMorgan has been hiring <u> <a href=\"http://qz.com/207163/jpmorgan-is-poaching-talent-from-silicon-valley/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a whole host </a></u> of Silicon Valley talent.  They have to do this to compete with the new startups, free riders: <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/11/wrappers-replacers-and-reformers-are-all-targeting-banks.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  wrappers, replacers and reformers. </a></u>  As Jamie Dimon puts it:  &ldquo;We move $10 trillion a day.  We&rsquo;re one of the largest payments systems in the world. We&rsquo;re going to have competition from Google and Facebook and somebody else &hellip; when I go to Silicon Valley&hellip; they all want to eat our lunch.&rdquo;So, although banks have a system designed to protect them through <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/04/the-reports-of-banks-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  licences </a></u>, it&rsquo;s not completely protected from margin squeeze and fee contraction through new players.  And we may say that this is just something to be concerned about in <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/03/complacent-corporate-bankers-do-you-need-to-wake-up.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the retail space </a></u>, but I suspect that the likes of Jamie Dimon don&rsquo;t see it that way as most of the upstarts don&rsquo;t.So, the bank of the near future will be value systems integrator of best-in-class apps, APIs and analytics that enable them to deliver the ultimate delivery of value aggregation for their clients.  If they don&rsquo;t move to this model, then their failure to adapt will have been proof of being ignorant of the change that is going on around them and, as noted by Roberto Ferrari who I interviewed the other day, if leadership teams are unable to lead change then they are not a leadership team anymore.",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In her own singularly inept way, iterim Reddit CEO Ellen Pao has done us all a favor (and we should thank her for it, really). She has managed to get us all talking again about the gender pay gap. <br/> <br/> First, of course, Pao  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/ellen-pao-considering-appeal-of-her-sex-discrimination-case-vs-kleiner-perkins/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sued Kleiner Perkins for discrimination  </a> </u> , and that got us talking about the issue. (A jury of six men and six women rejected Pao's claims of discrimination in a high-profile trial that highlighted Pao's poor job performance as much as anything else.) But then, last week, Pao made headlines when she announced a policy, at Reddit, of  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/04/06/ellen-pao-reddit-salary/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not allowing salary negotiations at hiring time  </a> </u> .</p><p> Pao's reasoning is that job applicants who happen to be gifted at salary negotiations shouldn't be allowed an advantage over applicants who are well qualified (in terms of job-appropriate skills), but meek and timid when it comes to negotiating. Which does have a certain logic to it. But one wonders: Is that  the best Pao can come up with  for fixing a serious, complex, systemic issue like the gender pay gap (which of course she simplistically and unhelpfully attributes to  sexism )? Squelch dialog? Penalize people with important business skills? Surely those aren't the principles Pao used when selecting attorneys to represent her in court? (Or maybe they were. She lost, after all.) <br/> <br/> No one who's looked at the data disputes that the pay gap issue exists (not just in the U.S., of course, but in nearly every country, across almost every industry). In America, it even exists  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/02/25/male-nurses-make-more-money/\" target=\"_blank\">   in female-dominated professions like nursing  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> The earnings disparity between men and women has become less glaring over time (from 1970 to 2007, the U.S. pay gap  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   shrank from 38% to 22%  </a> </u> ), but despite decades of progress, and recession after recession in which men have born the brunt of the economic damage, the gap refuses to go away.  <br/> <br/> So maybe it's not such a simple problem? Maybe it's not  just  \"sexism\" or straight-up discrimination? Certainly discrimination is a non-trivial part of it, obviously, but to assign the  whole thing  to \"discrimination,\" it seems to me, is simplistic, unimaginative, and wrong.</p><h3> Maybe the problem goes much deeper than any of us wants to believe. </h3><p> <br/> Douglas Kinnaird, managing director of UK recruitment consultancy MacDonald Kinnaird,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2013/04/12/do-women-discriminate-against-women-workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tells the story  </a> </u>  of an attempt by a British utility company, in the 1990s, to increase the number of senior women. The company established a positive discrimination policy designed to promote women over men. \"After three years, it found there was no change whatsoever,\" Kinnaird recalls. So the company hired a consultancy to find out why. They found three main reasons. \"The first was chauvinism; males didn&rsquo;t want to recruit females but, fascinatingly,  females did not want to work for females  in some cases. The second [reason] was that when a job came up internally, women just didn&rsquo;t apply. The third reason was that most people who progress in a large company are  mentored  &ndash; and senior men simply were not prepared to do that with young women, because of the potential for gossip, and so women  can&rsquo;t get a mentor .\" <br/> <br/> Now we're getting somewhere. Women discriminating against women; women unable to find a proper mentor; women not applying for higher-level positions, positions that might be (how shall we say?) distasteful in some way. </p><h3> But there's more.</h3><p> <br/> It's well known that the gender gap only gets more pronounced the higher up the food chain you go (an effect known as the \"glass ceiling\"). Women simply don't advance as far or as fast as men, when it comes to C-level and boardroom appointments. Mary Keane-Dawson, CEO of Convertr Media, alludes to a possible reason: \"Women find the toughness of business very hard to work with in the long term. Business is not about being horrible, but you do have to be able to make decisions that sometimes won&rsquo;t make you popular.\" English translation: Capitalism, at the highest levels,  as practiced today , calls for art-of-war \"skills\" that make most women's stomachs turn (and maybe rightfully so).</p><h3> Again, now we're getting somewhere.</h3><p> <br/> Men and women differ in how they view the world. One way this comes to be expressed is in self-esteem. In 2009, Brittany Gentile and colleagues published a meta-analysis ( Review of General Psychology , 13:1, 34-45) on  <u>  <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2009-02787-004\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gender differences in domain-specific self-esteem  </a> </u> . It's worth quoting from the abstract:</p><p> This meta-analysis examines gender differences in 10 specific domains of self-esteem across 115 studies, including 428 effect sizes and 32,486 individuals. In a mixed-effects analysis, men scored significantly higher than women on physical appearance (d = 0.35), athletic (d = 0.41), personal self (d = 0.28), and self-satisfaction self-esteem (d = 0.33). Women scored higher than men on  <strong>  behavioral conduct  </strong> (d = &minus;0.17) <strong>   and moral&ndash;ethical self-esteem </strong>  (d = &minus;0.38).</p><p> Maybe success-beyond-your-wildest-dreams in the job world inevitably favors people whose self-esteem isn't easily wrecked by the peculiar moral and ethical requirements of capitalism? Is that too touchy a subject? Too dangerous a hypothesis for the Ayn Rand apologists? <br/> <br/> All by way of saying:  This is a deep subject , not one that can be unpacked in five minutes by focusing myopically on  discrimination  (as convenient as that would be), or issues around pregnancy leave (which can be solved by requiring men to take it when women take it), or the dozen other standard-playbook issues that get tossed on the table whenever the \"gender gap\" comes up in polite conversation. <br/> <br/> As I say: Ellen Pao has definitely done us a favor. She's put the gender gap back under a spotlight. She has facilitated dialog, by trying to stop it. And: She's made it clear what kind of place Reddit is to work at. <br/> <br/> Thanks, Ellen. Good luck at that next job. And the one after that. And the one after that.</p>",

Assess where you can differentiate. Do you have a fund that&rsquo;s outperforming in a big way?

Does a portfolio manager take a unique approach to achieving strong returns?</p><p> Look for an angle that captures a reporter&rsquo;s attention &ndash; something that stands out from the crowd and would interest the reporter&rsquo;s audience.</p><h3> Step 2: Understand the media landscape</h3><p> The financial media is relatively small in Canada, which can be good or bad.</p><p> It&rsquo;s good because you can know the key players in short order. Check out media outlets like  Investment Executive, Advisor Group, Morningstar, National Post  and  The Globe and Mail . That&rsquo;s a great starting point to become familiar with the writers, the topics they cover, the tone they take, etc.</p><p> A small media market is bad because you have the whole industry vying for limited positive exposure. The competition for coverage can be fierce &ndash; all the more reason to have a great story to tell.</p><p> \"The competition for coverage can be fierce &ndash; all the more reason to have a great story to tell.\"</p><h3> Step 3: Clarify your objectives</h3><p> As you work on a plan for media coverage, consider what you want to achieve.

Good press is hard to come by, so make the most of it when you get the chance.</p><p> That&rsquo;s it!

My friends in the Northeast are rolling their eyes at me right now as the vestiges of this horrible, never-ending winter are just starting to melt, literally!</p><p> What would you say if I told you that the weather can have an affect on how engaged you or your employees are? During the winter season, there are a number of people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and yes it is a real affliction. Its symptoms can mimic that of depression, which also are very similar to those seen in people who are disengaged. SAD is in fact a subtype of depression and happens to people when they don&rsquo;t get enough sunlight. Some of the symptoms of people who suffer from this are:</p><li> Irritability</li><li> Tiredness or low energy</li><li> Problems getting along with others</li><li> Oversleeping</li><li> Having difficulty concentrating <br/>  </li><p> When people suffer from low engagement, they exhibit a number of the same symptoms as those listed above, in addition to isolating themselves from others, mood swings, low productivity, lack of creativity and an &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rsquo; attitude. If you see the warning signs, either in yourself or in others you manage, here are some of my favorite ways to spring-clean your way to engagement.</p><h3> Put a &lsquo;spring&rsquo; in your step and take a walk</h3><p> There&rsquo;s nothing better than getting out of the workplace and breathing in the (hopefully) warm air. Don&rsquo;t order lunch in, go out and get it. Conduct a meeting while walking outside. You will be less distracted by the phone or your computer, and more able to connect to that person on a one-to-one basis. There&rsquo;s also a great benefit when it comes to weight loss if you walk a lot!</p><h3> Clean out your workspace</h3><p> My father used to love to say that &lsquo;a sign of a sick mind is a clean desk&rsquo;. While I might have believed that when I was younger, as I spent more time in the workplace I came to realize that clutter was just a way for me to get out my frustrations. Looking back, I can see now that when I was really passionate and engaged in my work, I kept a much more organized and clean office. I wanted to be able to come in and easily find what I needed to get started on the work. When I wasn&rsquo;t as engaged, my inbox would overflow with things that didn&rsquo;t seem to have a home and I spent more time moving paper around then actually doing something with it. Making a conscious effort to clean up your workspace is a great way to get rid of those things that aren&rsquo;t that important and put the engaging stuff front and center.</p><h3> Plant some seeds and let them grow</h3><p> Engaged employees ignite growth; disengaged employees extinguish the spark. When you are passionate and committed to what you are doing, you usually aren&rsquo;t okay with the status quo. It&rsquo;s a time to be creative and innovative and see what can happen. Change doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight but sometimes just planting one new seed is all it takes to reengage your spirit. It&rsquo;s about making some small changes and then nurturing them along to create an environment in which you can do your best work.</p><h3> Exercise your mind</h3><p> Get out of your comfort zone and do something new. Take a class. It doesn&rsquo;t have to just be related to work. It can be personal in nature. Start writing more, be it a blog post, a journal entry, an article for a trade publication or just a plain old business memo. It&rsquo;s a great way to clear out the cobwebs in your brain. Read more. Try some challenging puzzles. Whatever it is, do something new (or reengage an old habit), to exercise your brain.</p><h3> Reconnect, both with yourself and with others</h3><p> My secret sauce for engagement is all about going back to basics, which is simply connecting with someone. That can be your boss or a loved one, a friend or a colleague, a spiritual advisor or a teacher. In our fast-paced, tech driven lives we&rsquo;ve unfortunately forgotten the fine art of simply connecting with another human being. It&rsquo;s all about creating an environment where great conversations can take place. It&rsquo;s about asking the right questions, and then listening, both to what is being said but also what is left unsaid. It&rsquo;s paying attention to what you heard, but also what you saw when connecting.</p><p> Spring is a great time to look forward with hopes and dreams of a bountiful garden of abundance. Don&rsquo;t waste time stuck in the winter doldrums of disengagement, but rather look at this as the season of full bloom, and get out there and engage.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> California has entered its fourth year of drought, and mountain snowpack is at just 6% of the long-term average. That means less melting snow feeding reservoirs during the warming spring months. To mitigate the effects of the drought, California Governor Jerry Brown issued the state&rsquo;s first ever executive order mandating a 25% reduction in water use. From a municipal credit perspective, the drought and reduced water consumption will have varying but broad implications for everything from Central Valley agricultural production to municipal hydropower generation to municipal water supply.</p><p> Central Valley credits supported by an agricultural economic base will continue to be pressured, as farm acreage lays fallow and economic activity falls. Across the nation, expect the price of tomatoes and avocados to spike because California accounts for over 95% of all U.S. production of these essential guacamole ingredients.</p><p> The impact to municipal hydropower credits is neutral or negative depending on the structure of the specific entities&rsquo; &ldquo;take or pay&rdquo; contracts. &ldquo;Take or pay&rdquo; contracts protect bondholders, insofar as the power purchaser must pay for the debt payments even if the power is not delivered. The key analysis to perform entails making sure the maturing debt matches the length of the &ldquo;take or pay&rdquo; contract. If the bonds mature before the contract&rsquo;s terms end, the bondholder is well protected. A recent mitigating factor for the drought is that the California economy has grown less dependent on hydropower than it was just two years ago. As the EIA.Gov charts (below) show, non-hydro renewables and natural gas electricity generation have both surged since 2011. It&rsquo;s encouraging to see a relatively quick rebalancing of energy production in the state, and it is also encouraging that the water suppliers and consumers have incentive to quickly change their behavior.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"245\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-13-at-10.50.26-AM.png\" width=\"445\"/></p><p> While water supply credits are not known for their adaptability, drought conditions do increase their pricing power. It may not be intuitive, but when water is scarce, water supply credits have more pricing power and therefore greater ability to manage their income statements and balance sheets. In wet years, the reverse happens: pricing power falls, operating margins narrow and balance sheets can deteriorate. In general, water credits are some of the most conservatively managed credits in muniland. Later this summer, when you&rsquo;re picnicking with family and friends discussing how pricey the guacamole dip has become, you can console yourself with the knowledge that your municipal bond portfolio is well insulated from the drought conditions in the West.</p>Source: NPR, US Department of Agriculture, US.

    "content": "<p> A Millennial weighing in on how to market to the Millennial Generation. </p><p> This is the third article in a series of tips and techniques for Advisors trying to reach the Millennial Generation. Check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/advisors-millennial-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Part 1  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/market-to-the-millennial-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Part 2  </a> </u>  before moving on.</p><p> This instalment will focus on why having a mobile strategy is key to reaching this demographic, as well as the the significant changes that Google is making to their algorithms come April 21st.</p><p> We, Millennials, have adopted digital like no other. It should come as no real surprise that mobile is our choice. Today&rsquo;s Millennials are the most mobile device population. So, just how much time does this demographic spend with their beloved smartphones? Here&rsquo;s what us Millennials are saying about mobile:</p><li>  90% of Millennials have a mobile phone.  <u>  <a href=\"http://heidicohen.com/millennials-marketing-mobile-social-media-required/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (Cohen, 2014)  </a> </u></li><li> The average Millennial checks his or her smartphone 43 times a day.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238294\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (Entrepreneur, 2014)  </a> </u></li><li> Mobile search will surpass desktop in 2015.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Search-Will-Surpass-Desktop-2015/1011657\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (eMarketer, 2014)  </a> </u></li><li> Millennials spend 14% more time (than any other group) interacting with their mobile devices during the average week.  <u>  <a href=\"http://heidicohen.com/millennials-marketing-mobile-social-media-required/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (Cohen, 2014)  </a> </u></li><li> 47% of Millennials access businesses via mobile at least once a day.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/09/27/millennials-love-smartphones-mobile-study/16192777/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (USA Today, 2014)  </a> </u></li><li> 36% have made a decision on where to spend money or have switched companies based on what they let them accomplish on mobile  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/09/27/millennials-love-smartphones-mobile-study/16192777/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (USA Today, 2014)  </a> </u></li><li> 14% say they wouldn&rsquo;t do business with a company that doesn&rsquo;t have a mobile site or app.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/09/27/millennials-love-smartphones-mobile-study/16192777/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (USA Today, 2014)  </a> </u></li><li> 86% say there are still a lot of websites without good mobile functionality.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/09/27/millennials-love-smartphones-mobile-study/16192777/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (USA Today, 2014)  </a> </u> <br/>  </li><h3> Actionable Millennial Marketing Tips</h3><p> <strong>  Advisors that don&rsquo;t speak mobile are losing out on business. </strong></p><p> With 90% of Millennials saying their phones never leave their side, it would make sense that Millennials turn to their mobile devices to research and find the information that drives their buying decisions. However, surveys suggest that this group is not always thrilled by the mobile experience that they receive from businesses. Millennials expect, even demand that your business be accessible by mobile, and if it isn&rsquo;t, they will leave.</p><p> Advisors looking to target Millennials need to adapt to mobile in order to best reach them on their preferred devices.   The first step for Advisors is to ensure that their website is mobile by  designing it responsively . Responsive website design refers to a website designed to adapt to any device a visitor is using. It is a single website that intelligently adapts to the screen the visitor is on without compromising functionality or aesthetics.</p><p> A responsive website is crucial for Advisors to reach the Millennials, who access the web through their mobile devices at an increasingly high rate.  If your website isn&rsquo;t mobile friendly, most Millennials will assume your practise is out of date, and will likely leave your website for one of your competitors. Offering a great mobile experience on your website helps you stay relevant and competitive, and makes for a great user experience.</p><h3> What change is Google making to its algorithm on April 21st?</h3><p> In 2015, the number of mobile users will overtake the number of desktop users. Google has released a statement that starting April 21st, Google will begin considering mobile friendliness as a factor when determining how to rank your website in Google searches. This will help users to get relevant, high quality search results that are optimized for their devices. If your website is not responsive, expect your search engine ranking to take a hit in just a couple weeks.</p><h3> How do I know if my website is mobile friendly?</h3><p> It is actually really simple to test your website and check whether it is mobile friendly or whether you need to update it. All you need to do is run your pages through the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\">   Mobile-Friendly Test  </a> </u> .   Click on the test and input the URL of the website you would like to check, hit the blue &lsquo;&rsquo;analyze&rsquo;&rsquo; button and the tool will determine whether your site is mobile-friendly.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Wealth managers have a tendency to assume that all their clients are as financially literate as they are.</h3><p> <br/> I recently wrestled with a CIO who wanted to pepper a client communication with the word &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; who refused to believe it wasn't common parlance as it was clearly common enough around the dinner tables in his world.</p><p> However in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; just under half of UK adults have a numeracy attainment age of 11 or below[1]. My CIO&rsquo;s argument was that &ldquo;private clients are different&rdquo; suggesting that wealth and financial knowledge/understanding are perfectly correlated. However as Ledbury Research flagged at a recent Market Research Society talk entitled &ldquo; Watching the Wealthy &rdquo;, the wealthy may be more likely to have post graduate degrees (think of all those MBA wielding entrepreneurs) but that isn&rsquo;t the same as a direct correlation[2]. Building your wealth as an entrepreneur doesn&rsquo;t necessarily leave you much time for reading about modern portfolio theory for example and inheriting wealth doesn&rsquo;t give you have an instant affinity with the City and its jargon and acronyms. </p><p> The FCA published an occasional paper last month on &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/news/fca-challenges-firms-to-review-approach-to-consumer-vulnerability\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Consumer Vulnerability  </a> </u> &rdquo;. It punctured the oft held misconception that vulnerability is only about poverty and poor educational attainment. Even the very wealthy and well-educated can find themselves suddenly and/or expectedly bereaved, unwell or redundant. Those with means and education may often have better support networks but that isn&rsquo;t always the case and at such times straightforward and clear information is more important than ever for everyone.</p><p> Added to which the number of people over 85 in the UK is predicted to double in the next 20 years and nearly treble in the next 30 years. Dementia affects one person in 6 over 80 and 1 in 3 over 95, and 40% of all people aged over 65 in the UK have a limiting longstanding illness[3].</p><p> Against this background it was interesting to reread Professional Adviser&rsquo;s piece from January on &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.professionaladviser.com/professional-adviser/feature/2392027/death-of-a-sales-aid-how-advisers-interact-with-the-clients-of-today\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the death of the sales aid  </a> </u> &rdquo; looking at how in a post RDR world sales aid is often a dirty word associated with product flogging and a lot of advisers think we are all now above such things. Yet one could argue that crafting short explanations and simple visuals can be a great starting point when engaging with clients fazed by an avalanche of information during the advice and/or onboarding process. As the FCA&rsquo;s paper notes: &ldquo; clear, simple information and explanation throughout the product life cycle is important to all consumers &rdquo; &ndash; worth noting as the industry grapples with the ongoing discussion about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ftadviser.com/2015/03/05/ifa-industry/your-business/fca-readying-discussion-paper-on-shorter-suitability-reports-Yn1AaJ0oZWyCDnIrP91U0L/article.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   suitability report length  </a> </u>  perhaps.</p><p> It is also important to remember we are not all digital yet particularly if we are over 65[4]. And making something easy to find isn&rsquo;t the same as making it easy to read, understand, digest or remember.</p><p> The FCA&rsquo;s consumer vulnerability paper includes a quote from the European Commission I hadn&rsquo;t seen before: &ldquo; The extent of vulnerability of an individual consumer depends on the interaction between the consumer&rsquo;s individual combination of characteristics on the one hand and marketing practices on the other. &rdquo; More dialogue with real clients and customers in the development of promotional materials and programmes is key to improving that interaction for the benefit of both sides.</p><p> As the way we all digest information evolves at a pace unheard of in the past, the commercial rewards for the companies that do this well are sure to follow.</p>[1] Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2012[2] Albeit that research by Consumer Focus in 2011 found that degree-level education was necessary to understand a high street bank&rsquo;s loan agreement and PhD level in order to understand payment protection insurance details.[3] Age UK, 2013[4] <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_373584.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Internet Access &ndash; Households and Individuals 2014</a>",

    "content": "<p> I am always amused to hear people say that great sales people are born that way, as in with a natural talent to sell, or as if there&rsquo;s a specific &ldquo;sales genius&rdquo; gene. On the surface, that may seem to be true for an easily distinguishable group within the sales world. Outgoing, lively, gregarious or outspoken sales people are bountiful. But these personality traits alone do NOT make a successful sales professional. Especially in a consultative sales environment structure, determination and a well-planned AND applied approach is invaluable and will lead to long-term success. As I believe Charlie Chaplin was once quoted saying, success is 10% talent, and 90% hard work. That also holds true when it comes to a consultative sales process.</p><h3> Do you know Yourself, Your Services &amp; Your Prospects?</h3><p> <br/> A big part of being successful in sales has to do with developing a customer-centric sales process and being diligent. Not pushy, not aggressive, but consistent and strategic. You will need to identify exactly what you are selling and what value it brings to your prospects.</p><p> Good and successful consultative sales people take time to fully understand what truly differentiates their service from all the other similar products or services of their competitors. They do their research. Successful sales professionals also make sure they know their own strengths and opportunities for improvement and growth.</p><p> Once you have established what you are selling, and how the features and benefits can be of value, then you can begin to do your research to find out who your best audience would be. In other words, to establish who are your &ldquo;ideal prospects.&rdquo;</p><h3> Do you want to be &ldquo;sold to&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> Gregarious, overenthusiastic sales people tend to be self promoting and very often they care more about themselves and their product/service than they care about the prospect. This and many other things can lead to sales people having the reputation of being, well sales people. When was the last time that you wanted to be sold to? Nobody wants to be sold to. That's a fact.</p><h3> Can I train to be a Great Salesperson?</h3><p> <br/> Unequivocally, yes! The advantage of consultative selling is that you don't have to be a \"born\" seller. In fact you actually need to learn and apply the principles and competencies of consultative selling to be successful.</p><p> A successful sales process is structured and supports the team in their effort to target the right companies and the appropriate decision maker within those organizations. Consultative sales professionals build their business with the goal to create a firm, long lasting and sustainable relationship with their clients. Using a consultative sales model and approach will not only provide the sales people with a framework to be client-focused, it will result in strategically developing clients with bigger budgets and larger deals.</p><p> You can approach learning the core consultative selling skills and acquiring the comprehensive knowledge in order to build your business based on consultative selling competencies from two avenues.</p><h3> Trial and Error or Training?</h3><p> <br/> One, by process of trial and error, picking up bits of knowledge, and piecing together your new skills laboriously over a lengthy period of time. Or, two - by participating in a comprehensive Consultative Sales Training Program. In the end, it&rsquo;s really about behavioral change and application.</p><h3> Application is key</h3><p> <br/> What do I need to learn and how do I need to apply these skills in order to be a Top-Seller? That is a process that takes time. Time to really understand AND practice applying in real-life situations. You really can&rsquo;t learn to play the piano by reading a book about the techniques of playing the piano. You need structured practice - and as we all know, practice makes perfect - if planned and well-executed.</p><p> To give you an overview of the core consultative sales competencies have a look at our Consultative Sales Model below.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-13-at-11.06.50-AM.png\" width=\"581\"/></p><h3> Always Research</h3><p> <br/> Research is the first key step to becoming a super-seller. Once you are in a position to guide your prospect, to become their consultant rather than to sell to them, they will not only appreciate it, they will also recognize the value you bring to the table without caring whether you have a suave personality or not. Honestly, while I really like working with people who are funny and witty, I prefer honesty, integrity and well informed sales people over somebody who flatters me. I think most people feel the same way.</p><h3> Why does a consultative sales process work?</h3><p> <br/> Because people really don't want to feel that they are sold to. Whenever I get a phone call from a provider (and trust me, being a business owner I get them all the time) I focus on those areas:</p><li> Is the sales person respectful and asks me if it's a good time to call</li><li> Does the sales person understand my business</li><li> Do they have something to offer that fits my business needs <br/>  </li><p> If one or more of those areas are ignored, I will make an excuse and get off the phone, but not before telling them that I am really not interested in receiving future phone calls.</p><p> A consultative sales process is designed to develop an ideal client profile for your unique service offering, tailoring the outreach to be specific, targeted and focused.</p><h3> How is a consultative sales process different?</h3><p> <br/> You are targeting specific industries and companies rather than just picking up the phone and calling. There are still so many companies out there who have their sales people \"dial for dollars\". It's not only ineffective, but also highly disrespectful. People want to feel special, whether they are a manager, a CEO or an assistant. Don't forget, they are humans and they act and react in a human way. If your prospect knows that you have chosen him/her because you have done your research, they will appreciate it. It will build rapport and trust.</p><h3> How will my business benefit?</h3><p> <br/> Once you have developed a sustainable consultative sales process (which needs to be embraced by your entire company, top down) you can focus on developing marketing material, events and building a healthy client base. If you are a sales person, you will be more effective if you are allowed to sell in a consultative sales environment and that equals more commission. If you are a sales manager, your team will be happy because they have a proven, transparent method that they can follow. As a result, revenue will increase and most importantly, your prospects will get a good impression and they will refer your company to other people. That's really when you know that things are working.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Entrepreneurs often hate to admit it, but there IS such a thing as a bad client. Here are nine types of clients that should make you seriously consider walking away. </p><h3> 1. They aggressively negotiate your standard (fair!) fee structure.</h3><p> <br/> Or, even more problematic, they ask you to waive the downpayment entirely. Here&rsquo;s the thing, if they don&rsquo;t have some skin in the game, then you are the only one who is committed to the creative process. If they don&rsquo;t want to pay at the beginning, odds are they won&rsquo;t want to pay you at the end, either. No downpayment means a capricious client can bail halfway through and you&rsquo;ll never see a penny. Unless you have a really scary lawyer. Or your uncle is in the mob.</p><p> Committing financially up-front changes a client&rsquo;s way of looking at you. You now have tangible worth. You are valuable. Because you value yourself enough to not work for free. Even narcissists grasp that.</p><h3> 2. You wait forever to get feedback on drafts or milestones.</h3><p> <br/> But, of course, if you don&rsquo;t reply to their texts or emails within 5 minutes they imply you must not be doing your job.</p><p> A healthy creative relationship needs to go both ways. You respect the client&rsquo;s time and investment, they respect your skill and contributions. That includes responding in a timely way so you can keep the project rolling forward. If they consistently take days or weeks to reply, consider yourself warned.</p><h3> 3. They won&rsquo;t provide written criteria or agree to project guidelines.</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes a client truly has no idea, and that&rsquo;s okay. But often, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;d rather be free to nitpick you to death. Written guidelines aren&rsquo;t just helpful for you, they also provide a tether for your client. It means they can&rsquo;t float off into creative fairyland without you charging them more.</p><p> If you start a job without providing written deliverables, or agree to perform a technical job without any written criteria to define what makes the job &ldquo;complete&rdquo;, then any client without a conscience can just feign ongoing dissatisfaction as a strategy to withhold payment. Which means you keep working because you really do want to get paid at some point. Until you snap and call up Uncle Vinnie.</p><h3> 4. They always &ldquo;forget&rdquo; to put change requests or draft approval in writing.</h3><p> <br/> Keep a paper trail. Emails, texts, however you typically communicate. Save them all. Every change to your deliverables, and every approval of a milestone should be in writing. That way, when a sociopathic client suddenly gets a case of selective amnesia about what they already approved, you have some backup.</p><h3> 5. They won&rsquo;t sign your contract, or they negotiate clauses to make it less binding.</h3><p> <br/> This goes back to the whole &ldquo;skin in the game&rdquo; concept. Anyone who balks at signing a contract either isn&rsquo;t serious about hiring you or prefers to keep things casual so they can exploit your services. You don&rsquo;t need either type. Don&rsquo;t even start making brainstorming notes on their project until you have a signed contract in hand.</p><p> Get a good contract tailored to your line of business. Even if it costs. The peace of mind brought by a binding agreement is well worth it. My contract cost $5000 and paid for itself in my first year of business. Granted, that year I had a client or two who heavily inspired this blog series&hellip;</p><h3> 6. They try to sell you on the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; of their project to guilt you into cutting rates.</h3><p> <br/> A client without a conscience will deftly manipulate your sense of obligation to their vision in order to get additional work for free, often while underpaying your normal rate in the first place. Your client&rsquo;s passion is nice, but it&rsquo;s not an acceptable reason to weasel out of fair payment or treat you like junk.</p><p> Not long ago, I needed someone&rsquo;s creative help on a passion project of mine. So I called the guy, and told him straight up. &ldquo;I have a project I can&rsquo;t do alone. I respect that your time and skills are valuable. It&rsquo;s for a good cause, but there&rsquo;s no budget. If this is something you are willing to do pro bono or on spec, I&rsquo;d be thrilled. If not, that&rsquo;s okay too.&rdquo; He loved the idea and we&rsquo;re moving forward. If he hadn&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;d still work together on budgeted projects.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a right and wrong way to solicit someone&rsquo;s help pro bono. Direct, transparent requests, where you are free to say no, is perfectly fine. Hanging their good cause over your head? Not a good way to start a job. It&rsquo;s really okay to say &ldquo;Sorry, my pro bono plate is full right now.&rdquo;</p><h3> 7. They &ldquo;just want it to go viral&rdquo;.</h3><p> <br/> As Jon Acuff once said, when you hear those words from a client, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time to stop, drop, and roll right out of the room&rdquo;.</p><p> Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t mean your client is without a conscience. But assumption that anyone can arbitrarily create viral content shows woeful ignorance of how social media works, and what they can expect from your services. For them, anything less than viral will mean you failed.</p><p> That won&rsquo;t be just a headache, it&rsquo;ll feel like an aneurysm.</p><h3> 8. They refuse to be educated on your process.</h3><p> <br/> When a client doesn&rsquo;t want to hear about the process, be wary. Unless of course, it&rsquo;s Coca Cola or they paid 100% up front. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to comprehend every step. But a good client will want to know how much work goes into the various phases, not only to validate their investment, but also to grasp what you&rsquo;re really doing for them.</p><p> When they haven&rsquo;t got a clue, they won&rsquo;t grasp your hesitation to &ldquo;change this one little thing&rdquo; when you know it means a full day of animation plus 18 hours of rendering. And they won&rsquo;t be forgiving when they don&rsquo;t have a new draft in hand by end of business today.</p><h3> 9. They act like their little bit of knowledge about your field means they can dictate your process.</h3><p> <br/> This is the other extreme from the guy who prefers to maintain ignorance. Remember, if they could do what you do, as well as you do it, they wouldn&rsquo;t need you in the first place. A little knowledge can be more dangerous than none, if it&rsquo;s accompanied by lack of conscience. When a client knows they have no idea, at least they&rsquo;re willing to learn.</p><p> This is especially dangerous when added to a refusal to put expectations in writing, hesitancy to sign a contract, and negotiation of your rates. Any client who combines several of these warning signs is going to cause you grief, either on purpose or by negligence. Most likely on purpose.</p><p> You&rsquo;re better off without the headache. Extricate yourself gracefully. Go get a good client (or three!)</p>",

Rule 17a-4 regulates how these documents must be retained. In combination, Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 require preservation of records in an easily accessible manner.</p><h3> General electronic document retention requirements are:</h3><li> There must be written and enforceable retention policies.</li><li> Data must be stored on indelible, non-rewritable media.</li><li> There must be a searchable index of stored data.</li><li> Data must be readily retrievable and viewable.</li><li> A backup of data must be stored off-site. <br/>  </li><p> For a digital document management solution to meet these requirements, it must allow readily available access to both scanned images and digitally-archived electronic documents without permitting alteration to the underlying images. The system should be flexible enough to meet a firm&rsquo;s written compliance policies, and should have instant search and retrieval functionality to locate documents requested by regulators.</p><p> If copies of documents are provided on CD or DVD to regulators, the CD or DVD should have a viewer and index included on the disc to enable viewing and searching on any computer, even if document management software isn&rsquo;t installed. A digital document management system should also enable documents and indexes to be stored on any indelible and non-rewritable WORM media, such as CD or DVD, to meet disaster recovery and third party storage requirements. (Please note that SEC-registered advisory firms are not subject to third-party storage rules.)</p><p> <strong>  For more detailed information about both SEC 17a-3 and 17a-4 regulations and their implications for document management, specifically digital document management solutions, click </strong> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.laserfiche.com/resource/white-paper-how-digital-document-management-solutions-support-compliance/?utm_medium=ad-digital\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <strong>    here   </strong>  </a> </u> <strong>  . </strong></p><p> Part f of Rule 17a-4 states that electronic storage media may be used, but requires you to inform your self-regulatory organization (SRO) prior to implementing any electronic recordkeeping solution, at least 90 days prior to use. If you plan on using electronic storage media, you must be able to represent on your own, either with assistance from your vendor or from a consultant of suitable expertise, that the media meets electronic document retention requirements.</p><p> With the advent of computer technology, including word processing software, spreadsheet and financial software and e-mail programs, as well as hardware devices and other media to store electronic information, the SEC updated these rules to include provisions for storage on electronic media. In 2001, the SEC released &ldquo;Electronic Recordkeeping by Investment Companies and Investment Advisers,&rdquo; Release Nos. IC-24991 and IA-1945, which amended electronic recordkeeping rules 31 a-1 and 204-2, expanding the ability of financial advisors to use electronic storage media to maintain and preserve records. Under the revised rules, advisors are permitted to maintain records electronically if they establish and maintain procedures to safeguard the records from loss, alteration or destruction; limit access to the records to authorized personnel; and ensure that scanned paper records are complete, true and legible.</p><p> For advisors or firms that are dually registered with FINRA, document management requirements are identical to SEC requirements. FINRA, however, requires registered representatives to submit a copy of your firm&rsquo;s imaging procedures, along with the notification letter.

Without an efficient index, it is difficult to find the information you want. Data must be stored on indelible, non-rewritable media.</li><li> <strong>  Your documents are not secure. </strong> Without reasonable controls to prevent unauthorized access to records, you cannot prove compliance with key regulations.

    "link": "if-you-dont-want-anyone-to-contact-you-why-are-you-on-linkedin-then",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I had this happen TWICE in the past week, so it begged for a blog entry. If you don&rsquo;t want anyone to  <strong>  ever </strong>  contact you online, why on EARTH are you on a social networking site like LinkedIn?  (&ldquo;Networking&rdquo; I thought was the operative word in the sentence.) I mean, people are expected to communicate with each other on these sites. So&hellip;</p><p> This weekend, I made it a point to reach out to some financial service professionals who had requested to be connected with me. (I never met them face-to-face or through another connection. They asked for a connection request and I accepted as their profession dictated we probably could work with each other.) Most of the individuals I reached out to were very receptive, even grateful for the greeting and talked about their weekend&hellip;.but I had not one, but TWO, who said, &ldquo; Stop spamming my inbox. &rdquo;  Are you for realz?</p><p> I spent some time thinking on that&hellip;did they forget they requested me to be their connection and not the other way around? Do they know how to adjust their email notifications so their inbox isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;violated&rdquo;? Do they know what a social networking site is? Let&rsquo;s discuss as I have a possible answer for each of these questions.</p><h3> Did they forget they requested me to be their connection and not the other way around?  </h3><p> I get it &ndash; we are busy. Everyone is moving a mile a minute and the information around us is moving at a lightning pace &ndash; we can&rsquo;t possibly remember every detail. This is why using CRM systems are important; they help us not have senior moments. LinkedIn has a very powerful one and  <u>  I did a webinar for Ash Brokerage that goes into great detail how to use this </u>  so you don&rsquo;t forget how or why you connected with someone in the first place. Use the CRM; make it your friend. It will not fail you during moments of, &ldquo;Who is this person?&rdquo;</p><h3> Do they know how to adjust their email notifications so their &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t violated?  </h3><p> Every social networking platform has a way to adjust notifications  &ndash; every single one of them. If you don&rsquo;t know how to use these and you blame someone else for spamming your inbox &ndash; there&rsquo;s only one person to blame and it&rsquo;s not the person in your inbox. Not taking the time to set-up your notifications and then getting upset when someone networks with you on a networking platform (which is still hard to wrap my brain around why that person is there to begin with) is like going to the store and getting everything for a banana split; except you forgot the banana then getting pissed that it doesn&rsquo;t taste right. The banana was pretty important to the dessert being built correctly, right? Take the time to get familiar with your notifications. If you don&rsquo;t remember why you reached out in the first place, then go back to the first question above and watch the webinar to learn how to use the CRM system or simply disconnect from the person. You don&rsquo;t want to be remembered as a grouchy fart when the time comes that you might need that person or you remember weeks later why you did need to connect. That could be an unpleasant and/or awkward conversation.</p><h3> Do they know what a social networking site is?  </h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/social_networking_site.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Webopedia defines it as follows:  </a> </u>   Abbreviated as SNS a  <strong>  social networking site </strong>  is the phrase used to describe any Web site that enables users to create public profiles within that Web site and form relationships with other users of the same Website who access their profile. LinkedIn is a social networking site. It is not an online r&eacute;sum&eacute; site contrary to what many believe or have been using it to do. The ability to actually connect with others and communicate are the key ingredients to a social networking site. If it were simply  <u>  an online r&eacute;sum&eacute; site such as Indeed.com </u>  &ndash; then you wouldn&rsquo;t really have a traditional inbox to manage that wasn&rsquo;t about jobs. Understand there is a subtle difference in LinkedIn and again &ndash; go back to the above questions of knowing why you connected with the person in the first place and managing your notifications so you can use networking sites correctly.</p><p> Last, but not least,, if you don&rsquo;t want to be connected to someone anymore &ndash; that&rsquo;s totally cool. My advice is to just simply disconnect. No harm, no foul.  Refrain from sending grumpy messages &ndash; let it go. The response of &ldquo;Stop spamming my inbox&rdquo; is the new version of what hanging up the telephone on someone felt like, except hanging up felt better.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Let&rsquo;s face it; we all want to be better when it comes to the  <u>  content </u>  that we put on our site. Chances are if you wrote a great post last week, this week you want to up the ante. It&rsquo;s just human nature. But besides being evolutionarily programmed to want to evolve, <strong>  we also are programmed to grow </strong> &mdash;and growing your  <u>  business </u>  all on your own may be holding you back. Maybe it is time to hire a copywriter.</p><p> If you are a perfectionist you may be sitting tinkering with the keys for hours to get just the right headline, or make sure the call-to-action is just right. There are more important things that you could be doing in your business rather than crossing &lsquo;t&rsquo;s and dotting &lsquo;i&rsquo;s. In fact, when you outsource your creative content the person doing it is not attached to your story&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t build it from the ground-up and been there through the hardship, so they can just polish off a great piece of content and be on their way. Just like that. It almost isn&rsquo;t fair! Instead of punishing yourself for wanting to be the best, why not reward yourself by taking some of the pressure off?</p><h3> But I have to get it just right!</h3><p> Yes, YOU do&hellip;and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s time that you turn over the reigns of creative control to someone known as a copywriter. It isn&rsquo;t that your content has to be perfect&mdash;it&rsquo;s probably already there. You just are your own toughest critic. Seeing hours of hard work done for you is a privilege that you just have to experience yourself.</p><p> Still not convinced? Even the biggest names in the business-writing world use ghostwriters and talented outsourced teams to finish their biggest projects. Ever wonder how some of the busiest people in the world find the time to  <u>  write </u>  a book year-after-year? The power is in the outsourcing. Sure, they write some of it, but they rely on talented people who can fill in the gaps for them. There&rsquo;s a reason Seth Godin writes short daily blog posts. If he wrote more than 200-300 words it would detract from the important stuff in his day. This is where outsourcing comes in. And it&rsquo;s not just for the stuff waiting in your queue, either.</p><h3> Help where it counts</h3><p> Having someone fix your website copy is another key privilege of outsourcing&mdash;you get to see what someone else would do to sell your brand. It&rsquo;s an ingenious idea because you&rsquo;re getting valuable feedback in terms of a second opinion that may earn you more money in the long haul. When you start taking the pressure off of yourself to produce, you get the creative sense of playfulness back&mdash;and that&rsquo;s insanely valuable for creating the brand image that you want and need. So next time you sit down to write and can&rsquo;t get it quite right, outsource a copywriter for &lsquo;perfection&rsquo; is just a click away.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> \"In the beginner&rsquo;s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert&rsquo;s mind, there are few.\" &ndash; Zen Buddhism Learning</h3><p> <br/> In 2004, I founded my second company. It was an online management toolkit for bar and restaurant owners called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/7810-irish-hospitality-website-t\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Barkeeper  </a> </u> . I already had a consulting practice where I worked one on one with hospitality business owners helping them with inventory analysis, vendor selection and cost control advice. As part of my practice, I developed training manuals for staff, cost control worksheets, checklists and standard operating procedures for my clients. It quickly became apparent that these templates and tools had a value that I wasn&rsquo;t fully capitalizing on so I decided to create a subscription based website where other bar and restaurant owners in Ireland could access my strategies and tools without me needing to be present.</p><p> This was 2004 in Ireland. Most of the country still had dial up internet (or none at all) and I knew nothing about web development. Less than nothing in fact. Still, with my youthful exuberance, my partner and I borrowed the most money we had ever seen and hired a firm to build out the &ldquo;vision&rdquo;. When they were done, they handed us the keys to a Ferrari and we weren&rsquo;t capable of riding a bicycle.</p><p> We were beginners in every sense of the word and just like the opening quote tells us, there are many possibilities for beginners. Too many. Too many to know what to do with. What do you pursue? What do you ignore? Should I pay for this print ad? Should we take a trade show booth? We made all the mistakes you could make. We started with a management toolkit for business owners and in the blink of an eye we had added a careers/recruitment section, a supplier directory, advertising space, and on and on and on. The business had no Unified Vision, no course to keep the ship on and we spent a lot of money learning how to simplify and specialize around our core competency. The one thing that saved us was the removal of &ldquo;possibilities&rdquo;.</p><p> When we did that, we grew. We were able to launch a version for the UK market and eventually the US market. Once we removed the &ldquo;possibilities&rdquo;, we were able to grow organically and pursue initiatives and opportunities which led to bigger revenues while making everything easier to manage. Possibilities kill businesses. When you&rsquo;re as green as we were starting our business, everything is a possibility. You think you can achieve everything. The true success comes from eliminating possibilities and focusing on opportunities aligned with your brand vision and core competencies and values.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t these written down, there&rsquo;s never been a better time to create the framework and foundation that will help simplify your business. Sir Jony Ive, Head of Design at Apple has helped change our lives with a focus on simplicity and opportunity:</p><h3> &ldquo;I think there is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity; in clarity, in efficiency. True simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation. It&rsquo;s about bringing order to complexity.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> 10 years ago,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   L Brands  </a> </u>  (formerly Limited Brands) based in Columbus Ohio and responsible for changing the way Americans shop, had 16 brands under it&rsquo;s umbrella and had a market valuation of $9.6 billion. Today, the company operates just 5 brands including Victoria&rsquo;s Secret, Bath &amp; Body Works and La Senza and is worth $27 billion. Les Wexner, founder and CEO (the longest serving CEO of a public company) recognized that his skills and those of his executives were diluted and distributed across too wide a playing field. Instead, they offloaded businesses that didn&rsquo;t have the potential to be super-brands and focused on those that could. It&rsquo;s a strategy that has paid off tremendously for shareholders.</p><p> Simplicity and alignment are essential to the scaling of a business. I once ran into a CMO of a large technology company at a trade show and I was curious as to what her day entailed. How did she manage her time and still direct the brand strategy. Her answer was astonishingly simple: &ldquo;I spend my day saying no&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll only know when to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; when you know where you&rsquo;re going and how you&rsquo;re getting there. Is it time to re-evaluate what you say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to?</p>",

    "content": "<p> With the many changes that Google has implemented in the past couple of years, and the increased competition on the search engine results pages (SERPs) as more businesses focus on improving their online marketing, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has unarguably become more challenging.</p><p> As a result of these changes, I see/read/hear a lot of SEO&rsquo;s and marketers questioning (or completely dismissing) the effectiveness of the more traditional and basic SEO practices. Although results will vary by industry and location, the &ldquo;basics&rdquo; can still be very effective for small businesses, and should be considered an important marketing option for them.</p><h3> Small Business SEO Case Study</h3><p> In what has traditionally been a Yellow Pages dependent industry, Dry Cleaners, like many other small businesses, are transitioning their marketing resources from the phonebook to the web, trying to find the most effective balance of web design, content creation, SEO, social media, and email marketing that will fit within their budget and time constraints.</p><p> I started working with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clotheslinecleaners.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Clothesline Cleaners  </a> </u> , a Boise area Dry Cleaning business, in late 2012, which for that industry and market was still reasonably early in the move towards online marketing. They had already established a small online presence &ndash; a website and some social media sharing &ndash; but decided to make it more of a priority as they saw the ROI of their yellow page advertising falling. Their goal was to completely eliminate their Yellow Pages budget.</p><p> At that time, Clothesline Cleaners had 2 stores, 1 in Boise (they now have 3 Boise locations), and another in the nearby city of Meridian, Idaho. For those of you unfamiliar with Boise, the metro area (including Boise and Meridian) has a population of 600,000 &ndash; 650,000 people.</p><h3> SEO Work</h3><p> This was a limited engagement project. It included initial on-page optimization (the four locations share one website) and local optimization for each store, a short period of monitoring and editing, and some extra citation building for the original locations.</p><p> <strong>  On-Page Organic SEO </strong></p><p> On-page organic SEO (traditional keyword based SEO) work included:</p><li> Keyword research</li><li> Mapping of existing webpages vs. webpages suggested by keyword research &ndash; looking for content gaps</li><li> Application of keywords to title tags, h-tags, meta description, alt. tags, and content</li><li> Minor changes in site architecture for better user experience</li><li> Basic internal linking <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Local Optimization (Google Maps) </strong></p><p> Each store was optimized for its locations. Local optimization included:</p><li> The completion of on-page SEO (Organic work outlined above)</li><li> Registered each location with the search engines</li><li> Built citations for each location</li><li> Content mark-up &ndash; including Name, Address, Phone Number (NAP) &ndash; was applied to webpages</li><li> Discussed importance of online reviews and possible strategies to encourage them <br/>  </li><p> Since the completion of our SEO engagement, Clothesline Dry Cleaners has been publishing one blog per month on their site, and continuing with a few social media updates (mostly Facebook) each week.</p><h3> SEO Traffic</h3><p> The chart displayed below represents the data gathered the from Clothesline Cleaner&rsquo;s Google Analytics reports. It shows total monthly traffic broken down into Organic (blue), Direct, Social Media and Referrals. Search Engine Optimization should impact  <strong>  organic search results. </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://brentcarnduff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Clothesline-Cleaner-traffic.png\"/></p><p> The following graph isolates the improved organic traffic. <br/>  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://brentcarnduff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Clothesline-Cleaner-Organic.png\"/></p><p> The data clearly shows that Clothesline Cleaners benefited from traditional SEO. They went from 20-30 organic visitors per month, to  <strong>  610 organic visitors in March of 2015 </strong> .</p><h3> Summary</h3><p> Although I recommend SEO to be part of on-going marketing efforts, clearly even this limited engagement is still producing good results for Clothesline Cleaners 2 years later. Future SEO efforts should include:</p><li> Collecting more positive reviews on Google and Yelp &ndash; this should be a priority.</li><li> Adding more text to existing website pages &ndash; the search engines like text.</li><li> Blogging more often &ndash; I would recommend at least weekly.</li><li> Promoting their content more aggressively through relationship building and outreach.</li><li> Building quality backlinks. <br/>  </li><p> Without incorporating some of the above listed SEO steps into their marketing plan, they risk having their future rankings and organic traffic dropping off as the search engines make adjustments and competitors improve their SEO.</p><p> Traditional Organic and Local SEO can play an important role in helping small businesses to improve they&rsquo;re online presence. Clothesline Cleaners is no longer paying for Yellow Page advertising.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Riana Aldana</p><p> Spring has sprung, and that means that spring cleaning is top of mind for many. However, <strong>  spring cleaning isn&rsquo;t just for houses &mdash; chances are that most RIAs&rsquo; PR and marketing strategies could use some brushing up, too. </strong> We&rsquo;ve gathered four actionable steps that advisors can use this season that will ultimately bolster business and strengthen new &mdash; or outdated &mdash; PR and marketing efforts currently in place.</p><li> <strong>  Review compliance rules and regulations </strong> . For RIAs with interest in PR and/or marketing campaigns, it&rsquo;s vital to sit down with your compliance team annually to review and understand changes and recommendations across social platforms and outgoing communication efforts. Are you allowed to connect with a new client on LinkedIn? Can you email prospects with a highlight reel of your latest Fox Business appearances? By staying up to date and in front of current regulations, you can keep your PR efforts on track and avoid making any compliance related mistakes.</li><li> <strong>  Tidy up Twitter. </strong> Optimizing Twitter&rsquo;s features is a good way to get in front of potential clients and stay relevant in the social sphere. To tidy up accounts, review your following/follower ratio and try to create a more even balance if the numbers are off, re-tweet relevant and trend-worthy topics, and engage with and start conversations with industry leaders and financial media. Now might also be a good time to determine if the platform still suits you &mdash; as a social tool, the platform can quickly become stale if you are not willing to dedicate time to Twitter and actively manage the account.</li><li> <strong>  Recognize alternative social tools. </strong> When people think social media they often think Facebook and Twitter. However, there are many more tools on the social terrain that can help boost business. Tools such as Hearsay Social and Spredfast are powerful instruments that increase audience engagement and brand affinity. For example, our client,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2014/06/12/penn-mutual-extols-benefits-of-social-media?ref=hp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Penn Mutual, embraced new technology, implementing Hearsay  </a> </u>  as a tool set for their advisors to share content daily with their clients.</li><li> <strong>  Update your game plan. </strong>  For those with a current plan, spring cleaning marks a time to review what worked, and very simply, what didn&rsquo;t. As discussed above, if you have let Twitter or Facebook go stale, it might be time to cut the social cord and look into other efforts. However, if you thrive using social tools or are interested in incorporating different tactics, consider next steps &ndash; hosting a blog, holding a Facebook competition that aligns closely with business objectives, identifying an underserved niche in your firm and reaching out to regional business groups to host seminars (say, a local Women&rsquo;s Leadership Group), etc. When it comes to traditional media relations, work with your PR team to refine your business messages and settle on which ones are most meaningful for your firm to garner media coverage on. <br/>  </li><p> The perception of your RIA and the company&rsquo;s brand is imperative to future success, and the use of PR and marketing efforts can aid in getting your &ldquo;story&rdquo; out there to prospects. Taking the time to review these efforts once a year will keep a campaign in line and help the business to stay on track in maintaining and growing their image with prospect, current clients and industry peers.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What makes you happy?</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People  </u> </a> : This question is not as easy as it might seem.</p><p> According to Shawn Achor in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307591549/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307591549&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=GXXCEPIOG2I2ABF4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Happiness Advantage  </a> </u> , most Americans find free time harder to enjoy than work. Yes, you read that right. It&rsquo;s easier for most of us to be successful than to be happy.</p><p> Why do we have a hard time enjoying free time?</p><p> Guilt. Fear. Pressure. In today&rsquo;s age of achievement, we put a tremendous emphasis on success and very little importance on happiness.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/x3ugS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   We are trained to be effective and successful, but we are not given skills to be happy  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/x3ugS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  . </a>  </p><p> And this is a huge problem. Shawn Achor calls this the happiness myth:</p><p> <strong>  The Happiness Myth: </strong></p><p> If we work hard and become successful, we will be happy.</p><p> From a young age, most of us are taught that if we work hard, then we will be successful; and once we are successful, we will be happy. I am completely guilty of this myth. I used to live by what I call the &lsquo;when-then&rsquo; mindset.</p><li> When I get an &lsquo;A&rsquo;, then I&rsquo;ll be happy.</li><li> When I get this house, then I&rsquo;ll be happy.</li><li> When I finish this program, then I&rsquo;ll be happy. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Listen to my story about the When-Then Mindset: </strong></p><p> For audio, please visit <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/04/the-science-of-happiness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> . </p><p> We have this mindset all wrong. In fact, our ideas about happiness are completely backwards! More than 200 scientific studies on nearly 275,000 people found that people who start off happy are more likely to succeed; people who start off unhappy are more likely to fail. Here is the happiness truth:</p><p> <strong>  The Happiness Truth: </strong></p><p> If we are happy, we are more successful</p><p> Happiness helps our productivity, our immune system, our creativity, our income and our effectiveness.</p><p> Happiness gives us a huge competitive advantage&ndash;and it has great side-effects.</p><p> One study followed college freshmen for 19 years after graduation. The researchers found that those students who were happier in college had a higher income than their unhappy classmates 19 years later.</p><p> I chose the Happiness Advantage for our March Science of People Club and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier = ) because the tips and science in this book are phenomenal.</p><p> Here is what you need to know about happiness right now:</p><h3> 1. Happiness Baseline</h3><p> Research has found that all of us have a kind of happiness baseline&ndash;that we have a typical amount of happiness during our lives. However, with the right effort we can INCREASE our happiness baseline:</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than a little comforting to know that people can become happier, that pessimists can become optimists, and that stressed and negative brains can be trained to see more possibility.&rdquo; &ndash; Shawn Achor</p><p> No matter who you are, what your experiences are or how you think, you can learn how to be happy&ndash;and it is absolutely a learned skillset.</p><li> Change Your Mindset: Happiness doesn&rsquo;t just happen to you. Happiness is a lifestyle.</li><h3> 2. Your Mental Fulcrum</h3><p> How can you change your mindset? How can you learn to be happier? Achor calls this the Fulcrum and the Lever principle.</p><p> You change your performance by changing your mindset.</p><p> Greek mathematician Archimedes said, &ldquo;Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.&rdquo;</p><br /><p> Your mindset is the fulcrum and the length of the lever is your potential power. If you move your mindset to be more positive, the lever of possibility lengthens, which leads, as empirical studies have shown conclusively, to eventual success.</p><h3> 3. Happiness Habits</h3><p> &ldquo;Each activity listed below not only gives us a quick boost of positive emotions, improving our performance and focus in the moment; but if performed habitually over time, each has been shown to help permanently raise our happiness baseline.&rdquo; -Shawn Achor</p><li> <strong>  Write a thank you email </strong>  to an employee or friend.</li><li> <strong>  When you meditate </strong> , even just five minutes a day, it rewires your brain to &ldquo;raise our levels of happiness, lower stress, and improve immune function.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Set up something to look forward to </strong> &ndash;it can be as small as a chocolate after lunch or seeing a friend this weekend. Knowing you have this coming up releases dopamine in your brain as if you are actually doing it. In other words, you benefit from the reward before actually getting the reward.</li><li> <strong>  Commit  conscious   acts of kindness </strong>  by doing one nice thing for someone every day. Buy coffee for the person behind you in the drive through or help someone else bag their groceries at checkout.</li><li> <strong>  Make your environment inspiring. </strong>  How can you infuse positivity into your surroundings? A beautiful pen? A nice walk mid-day? A better ringtone? Make an effort to surround yourself with things that make you smile.</li><li> <strong>  Exercise whenever you can </strong> &ndash;I know we have heard this one before. But even small walks a few times a week results in significant improvements in mental health.</li><li> <strong>  Spend on experiences. </strong>  Research shows that spending money on experiences and activities rather than on material purchases makes us happier in the moment and over time. Look at your credit card statement over the past month- what did you spend more on?</li><li> <strong>  See #9 below </strong> , which is the most important happiness habit.</li><h3> 4. Find Your Thing</h3><p> My favorite part of the book was actually a rather small section called &ldquo;Signature Strengths.&rdquo; Researchers told people to focus on a signature strength and focus on exercising it every day. This is more than just &ldquo;pursuing your passion.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the daily practice of utilizing your natural born strengths. This can be anything from organizing to cracking jokes to making small talk.</p><h3> 5. The Tetris Effect</h3><p> The Tetris Effect found that our brains love to find patterns. In one study, participants who had to play tetris for 3 hours a day began to dream in tetris patterns and see tetris shapes in their mind all day long. We do this pattern finding with many things in our life. For example, IRS employees are trained to look for mistakes 8 hours a day on forms. When they leave work, they can&rsquo;t help but keep looking for mistakes and errors. You need to train your brain to recognize positive patterns. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><li> Whenever you have a positive experience put a star next to the event or time in your calendar.</li><li> Journal about positive experiences at the end of every day.</li><li> Talk about the highlight of your day over dinner.</li><li> Think of three positive things in your life before you check your email. <br/>  </li><p> In this way, you can retrain your brain to spot patterns of positivity rather than patterns of failure.</p><h3> 6. Falling Up</h3><p> I learned a new phrase in this chapter:</p><p> <strong>  Post-Traumatic Growth </strong></p><p> When you learn from failure and train yourself to capture growth after an apparent failure.</p><p> Michael Jordan was cut from his High School Basketball team. Walt Disney was fired from a newspaper for not being creative enough. The Beatles were turned away by a record executive who said that guitar groups were on their way out. They didn&rsquo;t let failure stop them. Why should you?</p><p> <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/5bQ75\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Don&rsquo;t bounce back, bounce forward  </u>  . </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;Things do not necessarily happen for the best, but some people are able to make the best out of the things that happen.&rdquo; &ndash;Tal Ben-Shahar </p><p> Study after study shows that if we are able to conceive of a failure as an opportunity for growth, we are all the more likely to experience that growth.</p><p> <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/l1_9f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Don&rsquo;t define yourself by what happens to you, define yourself by what you make out of what happens to you  </u>  . </a>  </p><h3> 7. The Zorro Circle</h3><p> In the classic movie Zorro, the main character has to master everything in a small circle during his training. As he gets better, his circle gets bigger and bigger. Achor argues that in the face of overwhelming odds, we can regain control by beginning with small manageable goals. In other words, we should find small circles of control in our life and focus on making those small areas as good as they can be. Control brings us happiness and fixing small problems helps us fix bigger ones.</p><li> As humans, we crave the feeling that we are in control because it helps us see ourselves as masters of our own fate. Whether this is in social or professional spaces, it is one of the strongest drivers of both happiness and performance.</li><li> Interestingly, happiness has less to do with how much control we actually have and more with how much control we think we have. Hence the importance of small circles of control that we pick and work on purposefully. <br/>  </li><h3> 8. The 20-Second Rule</h3><p> Happiness has barriers. The 20-second rule is all about how to minimize the blockers of happiness by turning bad habits into good ones. It&rsquo;s about lowering activation energy for good habits and making it really hard for yourself to engage in bad ones. Right now think of the things that cause you moments of frustration or minimize your productivity. These can be both big and small:</p><p> <strong>  Listen to me explain some of mine and how I applied the 20-second rule: </strong></p><p> For audio, please click <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/04/the-science-of-happiness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> . </p><p> Now think of ways that you could prevent these blockers from coming up and put the better habit in a path of least resistance. For example, I want to improve my mile time. Snacking is a huge barrier to me and I mindlessly eat. I got rid of all the snacks in my kitchen that do not require assembly. I only kept the healthy ones (carrots, grapes) that are grab-able.  I also realized I would get anxious whenever I saw a push notification from my email so I turned it off and put it in a folder in my phone so it is harder to open mindlessly. But, I moved my meditation app to the home screen. I also leave my workout clothes out next to my desk so I can change easily.</p><h3> 9. Make Social Investments</h3><p> This chapter made me the most excited. This is the principle that stumped me for the longest time and when I finally figured it out, it completely changed my life:</p><p> Our happiness is directly connected to the strength of our social connections and support network.</p><p> <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/I36U_\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Achor says that investing in social relationships is the most important of all the happiness principles  </u>  . </a>  </p><p> We typically think about investing in our stock portfolio or our savings account, I want you to think about investing in your social capital or your friend account. Strong relationships help our immune function, our happiness and our work success.</p><p> I thought that the chapter was a little skimpy on how to do this because social intelligence is not an easy thing to grasp. My favorite tip on building your social IQ is to embrace the idea of:</p><p> <strong>  Stop Being Boring: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Abandon boring social scripts. </strong> Chatter, meaningless conversations and small talk breed shallow, unfulfilling relationships. If you really want to connect with someone try asking them real questions and giving them unscripted, uncanned answers.</li><li> More tips on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2014/01/stop-boring/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not being boring here  </a> </u> . <br/>  </li><h3> 10. The Ripple Effect</h3><p> The tips in the Happiness Advantage don&rsquo;t just benefit you, they benefit everyone in your life. Our emotions are contagious. When we have a more positive mindset, increase our happiness and invest in our joy, it runs off on others.</p><p> Increase your happiness and bring more joy to the world.</p><p> Investing in your social skills and relationships was Achor&rsquo;s strongest recommendation for improving happiness.

Just ask, &ldquo;Per your suggestion, we had planned to cover the following five points. What would you like us to emphasize as we go through our presentation?</li><li> <strong>  Second, focus the discussion mostly on their business, not your business. </strong> They know who you are, and if they want more information about certain capabilities, they&rsquo;ll ask. So keep the material about you to a minimum. The majority of your content should focus on their issues, their challenges, and how you can help them.</li><li> <strong>  Third, pace the presentation and make it engaging. Have a great conversation&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk at your client. </strong> Every four or five minutes, pause. Ask if there are any questions. Check for understanding. Ask a question yourself to draw them out&mdash;for example, &ldquo;Is this an approach you&rsquo;ve tried before? What worked well? What didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; Ideally, you&rsquo;ll equally share the air time and talk about the same amount of time.</li><li> <strong>  Fourth, use your media effectively. </strong> Don&rsquo;t use a densely-written document as your presentation&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen people put up PowerPoint slides that had hundreds of words on them and large tables full of data. If you use slides at all, they should be spare and emphasize graphics, photographs, and illustrations to make your points. Consider using wall charts, videos, placemats, and other alternative means to tell your story.</li><li> <strong>  Fifth, make it entertaining and memorable. </strong> Use humor. Tell relevant stories about work you&rsquo;ve done with similar clients. Push their thinking. If you&rsquo;re bland and boring they won&rsquo;t remember you. You need to stand out.</li><li> <strong>  Sixth, role-model what it&rsquo;s like to work with you. </strong> If it&rsquo;s your firm making the pitch, bring key members of the delivery team who will actually do the work. Make sure that everyone has a role, and that it&rsquo;s not just the senior people who talk&mdash;give some air time to your mid-level people. Clients often cite capabilities and industry experience as key factors in awarding a contract, but also the quality of the team and chemistry with them. <br/>  </li><p> I rarely compete with other firms for a specific piece of work, but a few years ago I did find myself in that position. Instead of making a presentation to the client, I ran the two hour session as though it were a workshop with a group of their executives. For example, I handed out a one-page case study about a difficult client relationship dilemma, one that I told them I might use in a workshop with their professionals. We discussed it, just like we would in the actual program. I told them: This is how I&rsquo;ll interact with your people&mdash;I want you to experience it here. Needless to say, I won the project.</p><p> <strong>  What have you found to be effective in making successful sales presentations? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Business growth doesn&rsquo;t come from wishful thinking. As you know, it takes a lot of hard work. The growth of your business is not an option &ndash; it is a necessity. Coordinating the right mix of strategies to gain market share and improve client acquisition rates is essential to advance your firm in today&rsquo;s economy.</p><p> Many advisors share a common thread of business development initiatives: referral campaigns, capturing new assets from existing clients, and forming strategic alliances with other professional teams. During difficult market times, uniting with attorneys, insurance agents, CPAs, and other professionals is one of the best investments you can make for your firm. While cost and skill sharing are notable reasons to form an alliance, an association with suitable partners will extend the depth of your team and provide a means to offer clients a full spectrum of services.</p><h3> What Is A Strategic Alliance? </h3><p> To ensure alliances are truly successful for your firm, you must understand what they are and more importantly what they aren&rsquo;t.  A strategic alliance is an agreement between two or more parties to pursue a set of agreed upon objectives while remaining independent organizations.&sup1; Often advisors attempt to organize informal alliances and merely hope a reciprocal referral pattern will fall into place.</p><p> <strong>  Picture this &ndash; it may sound like a familiar situation to you: </strong></p><p> You invite a potential alliance to lunch and spend time chitchatting about your firm. You talk about your shared niche market(s) and try to persuade them to understand how your firm is different from the competitor down the street. You end up having a nice lunch and agree to refer clients to one another over a hand shake.</p><p> Heading back to your office, you reflect on your meeting and give yourself a pat on the back - thinking you have formed a solid strategic alliance that will provide a flow of referrals to your firm. You may even go so far as to start referring clients to their company. But something happens; you notice you&rsquo;re not procuring a significant level, if any at all, of qualified referrals in return.  </p><p> Why and how does this happen?</p><p> It&rsquo;s simple; you have formed an informal arrangement that doesn&rsquo;t represent a true strategic alliance.  An unorganized plan that lacks an imperative reason for others to provide referrals will fall short of your desired result. </p><h3> Strategic Alliances - Where To Start</h3><p> Advisors who take the time to invest in building strategic alliances generate higher revenues and profits. Done correctly, it only takes a small number of strategic partners to have a positive impact. </p><p> Begin to structure your extended team with other professionals whose efforts are symmetrical with the needs of your clients. Identify professionals that share your niche market and can provide solutions for your clients beyond your existing realm of services. Measure the value of a potential partnership by assessing the quality of solutions you can provide for your client&rsquo;s problems, needs, and wants.</p><p> Brainstorm! You can form alliances with a host of different professionals; get creative and explore your opportunities.</p><h3> Strategic Alliances = Long-Term Success </h3><p> Strategic alliances will help catalyze your firm&rsquo;s growth because they empower each partner to serve clients better. Through the alliance, your clients benefit from the expertise of trusted professionals and feel satisfied knowing you are working together as a team to help them achieve their financial goals.</p><p> A successful alliance is a formal affiliation between two parties that creates a vested interest to help the other grow.</p><p> In a study performed by CEG Worldwide, it is noted that referrals from other professionals are a key source of new clients for 81.9% of today&rsquo;s top financial advisors.&sup2;</p><p> Your affiliation is a formalized, ongoing relationship that encompasses a distinct set of responsibilities committed to by both companies. Commitment from both parties provides the foundation for a deep routed, profitable relationship for all involved. At the core of your affiliation is a set of bona fide benefits to each partner involved - most often in the form of added value to clients and specialized expertise. </p><h3> Follow The 10-Step Process </h3><p> <strong>  Step 1: Identify Potential Partners </strong></p><p> Often financial advisors choose to work with professionals that clients have already secured for outside services. Expand beyond this inner circle and explore other firms that focus on people in your niche market. Start by making a list of the top three local attorney, CPA, and insurance firms in your area. Identify potential partners through Google searches, LinkedIn profiles, city information, and any other resources you have access.</p><p> Choose counterparts that you can easily collaborate with, develop good connections, and those that will actively introduce you to new clients rather than waiting for an opportunity.</p><p> <strong>  Step 2: Research Potential Partners </strong></p><p> Gather data and research your potential alliances. Your goal in this step is to support your position that a strategic alliance with this firm will be mutually beneficial.</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: Make the First Call </strong></p><p> In a tough economy where all professionals are feeling the crunch, everyone can use extra help with business development. Contact your selected alliance prospects and schedule an appointment to discuss opportunities for working together. Tell them you will share data about your mutual niche market, how to market to them, and the most effective way to earn their business.</p><p> <strong>  Step 4: The First Meeting </strong></p><p> Your goal in this step is to determine suitability to form an alliance.</p><li> Talk about the potential alliance, the benefits of working together, and the opportunity for revenue sharing.</li><li> Share the information you gathered earlier about your mutual niche market, how to market to them, and the most effective way to earn their business. This will support your case for forming an alliance and position you as an industry expert and influencer.</li><li> Provide specific details regarding expectations and what each firm will do to uphold a mutual commitment for your partnership.</li><li> Evaluate and gain a better understanding of your potential alliance.</li><li> Make a mutual decision. If you determine working together will benefit all parties involved, your clients and each firm, schedule your next appointment to finalize your agreement. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Step 5: Identify Specific Opportunities </strong></p><p> Brainstorm about every opportunity to work together. Focus on core interests and business themes you have in common. Discuss objectives, obstacles, and expectations for your future relationship. Determine what your alliance should accomplish over the next 12 months.</p><p> <strong>  Start Small </strong></p><p> <strong>  It only takes a small number of strategic alliances to create a positive impact </strong></p><p> <strong>  Step 6: Establish Revenue/Profit Goals </strong></p><p> Determine ideal and minimum revenue and/or profit goals for your alliance. Your ideal goal should represent the revenue and new assets under management it will take to make the program a success. The minimum goal is what must be achieved in order to continue the partnership.</p><p> <strong>  Step 7: Develop an Agenda </strong></p><p> Create an agenda that includes any event or campaign you plan to execute with your strategic alliance over the next 12 months. Identify the goal for each item, the strategy you will use to obtain results, when the event will take place, and who will be responsible for implementation.</p><p> While creating your strategy, include the following best practices to ensure your partnership is effective and creates an opportunity for new clients.</p><p> <strong>  Step 8: Present the Plan </strong></p><p> Schedule a meeting with your potential alliance to present your plan. Review your opportunities, strategy, and the specific steps you will take to reach your goal. Discuss profit and revenue goals as well as expenses. Look for any gaps in your initial plan and make necessary modifications. </p><p> <strong>  Step 9: Commitment and Implementation </strong></p><p> Upon mutual agreement, make a commitment and implement your plan. Identify team members who will act as a point person to ensure implementation takes place as scheduled.</p><p> <strong>  Step 10: Analyze and Follow Up </strong></p><p> Continually refer back to your alliance plan to monitor and celebrate successes and make changes when you find something isn't working. You can have the most brilliant plan in the world, but it will do no good if it isn&rsquo;t implemented and followed up on regularly.</p><p> Download Ironstone&rsquo;s workbook, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Building Strategic Alliances &ndash; Best Practices for Financial Advisors  </a> </u> &rdquo;.</p><p> The e-book will guide you through each step and includes tables, checklists, and notes area</p><p> to keep all of your information in one place.</p><h3> Patience, Persistence, and Profit </h3><p> Building a professional network takes time along with a lot of hard work. The benefits you present to your clients in the form of added expertise, collaboration with other professionals, and credibility in the market are worth your investment.</p><p> Serving affluent clients requires that you have a suite of services beyond investment advice available. Don&rsquo;t give up.</p>",

    "link": "how-to-know-if-a-strategic-partnership-will-work-before-its-even-started",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Lately, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work on strategic partnerships with my clients .</p><p> Given most of my clients are in a growth phase, it makes sense. There are numerous studies showing <strong>  SPs providing anywhere between 20% &ndash; 50% of growth in new clients. </strong> Unless you&rsquo;re going way outside the square to grow your business, you can&rsquo;t afford to ignore them.</p><p> Thing is many simply struggle to make them work. The reasons? Well, when I go into businesses I often see one of a number of issues going on:</p><li> The firm has lots of informal partnerships &ndash; accountants, lawyers, mortgage brokers, general insurers etc. &ndash; but they produce a weak and/or inconsistent flow of referrals.</li><li> The partnerships they have are poorly matched. They&rsquo;re basically &ldquo;dating&rdquo; businesses who they have little in common and share no common goals with.</li><li> Nobody has a clue, beyond the most superficial understanding, of what the other partner really does.</li><li> Expectations have never been set, which is nine-times-out-of-ten the seed of future issues.</li><li> There has never been discussion at a granular, operational level as to how it&rsquo;s going to work.</li><li> One or both parties have assumed that financial incentive alone will drive the relationship. It&rsquo;s very rare that it does, and even rarer that is does in any sustainable way. <br/>  </li><p> By far the most common issue though is a lack of patience. <strong>  Forming solid partnerships is a 2-4 month process if you do it properly. </strong> A lot of businesses fall down because they expect a partnership to start producing immediately, and they give up or reduce their efforts if it doesn&rsquo;t do so. Oddly, the point many give up is often just before reaching the tipping point at which most partnerships begin to enter a phase of production.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve found success in applying a very deliberate and unhurried process that incorporates four key steps. I call it the PTNR process.</p><li> <strong>  PROSPECT </strong>  potential partners and find out where&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a match and where not.</li><li> <strong>  TEST </strong>  the relationship on paper, identifying if enough mutual value can be created.</li><li> <strong>  NURTURE </strong>  the flow of clients, through identifying &ldquo;referables&rdquo; and upskilling each other.</li><li> <strong>  RELATIONSHIP </strong>  management, through regular communication, reporting and training. <br/>  </li><p> Underneath this process lies a series of exercises, conversations and agreements that move all partners toward a common purpose and operating model.</p><p> However, possibly one of the most important elements is asking five key questions at the end of Stage 1, prior to progressing any further.</p><li> Do you connect as people?</li><li> Do you share common business values?</li><li> Do you share an interest in certain types of clients?</li><li> Can you add value to each others businesses?</li><li> Can you add value to each others clients? <br/>  </li><p> These five questions, if answered completely honestly, save you a lot of time, money and wasted effort in trying to make SPs work when they truthfully don&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p><p> Even where a business has long established partnerships, I still insist upon going back and asking the questions just as you would a new partner. The frequent result is the removal of one or more blocks that were stopping the partnership from blossoming.</p><p> Successful Strategic Partnerships, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, are about people first. They are about connection, purpose, mutual value and common vision. Without these things, regardless of the potential financial upside, frankly you&rsquo;re probably better off investing your time elsewhere. It&rsquo;s going to be an uphill struggle to make it work.</p><p> Of course, there is much, much more than just this, including analysing client bases, educating partners, identifying how and when to refer, establishing reporting and knowing what terms to put forward. These are all things that I cover as part of my coaching too. It&rsquo;s an interesting area and, in my experience, something that frequently separates hugely successful businesses from those who get just by.</p><p> Before all of that though, start with those five simple questions. <strong>  If you can&rsquo;t answer yes to at least 3 of them, consider whether you have the right strategic partner. </strong> In doing so, you will save yourself and your business a lot of pain and wasted effort.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As I turned on my computer Tuesday and started to navigate my various social accounts, I found out that it was  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EqualPayDay?src=tren&amp;lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #EqualPayDay  </a> </u> . It was a day for all of us to discuss the obvious issue with pay equity in this country. It also marks how far into the year women must work in order as much as their male counterparts earned in 2014.  I&rsquo;m always down for a good social campaign, but something about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3044613/strong-female-lead/today-is-equal-pay-day-how-can-we-finally-close-the-gender-wage-gap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #EqualPayDay  </a> </u>  feels banal.</p><p> It is well documented that women are paid less than men in the workplace. We also know that black and latino women fare the worse with regard to pay equity. The bigger question is:  <strong>  what are employers going to do about it? </strong>  It&rsquo;s cute to hop on social media and tweet your support for the day, but again what is anyone going to do about it?</p><p> I am a solopreneur with a little over two years under my belt as a business owner. I can assure you when my time comes to hire a few good women to assist me with building my legacy they will be compensated adequately for their efforts regardless of gender, color or any other identifiable criteria beyond their control. That&rsquo;s my vision for my company.  I have powerhouse women friends who also own their own businesses and have dedicated themselves to filling in all the pay equity gaps women have had to deal with for eternity by offering: fair salaries, childcare and eldercare options, real maternity leave that isn&rsquo;t confined to a 12 week FMLA allotment etc. You see, the end to the gender pay gap in this country has to start with good intentions. If you have little or no regard for a certain subsection of citizens or better yet the people you employ (who happen to be human beings like you) none of this will change.</p><h3> Food for thought&hellip;</h3><p> Women don&rsquo;t just get screwed on salary alone, it is the entire package and delivery that creates economic disparity. Every unpaid medical or maternity leave, the inordinate costs of childcare and eldercare; and wages that have stopped increasing or do so marginally prevents us from being able to sustain ourselves and our families. According to a recent study by the  <a href=\"https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Glynn-Breadwinners-report-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Center For American Progress  </u>  , </a>  over 50% of women work outside of the household and contribute to their families economic security.</p><p> I have been pretty transparent about my  <u>  <a href=\"http://thearistocracyofhr.com/corporate-america-has-lost-another-soldier-me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   salary negotiation missteps  </a> </u>  over the course of my career. However, what&rsquo;s really disturbing is that the &ldquo;sisterhood&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t collectively on the same page when it comes to closing this gap. Out of the seven positions I have held over the course of my career, I have had one male boss. The rest have been women. In all circumstances, not one of them ever advocated or demanded I be paid my worth. They used to lie and tell me that they were pulling for me to get the raises I was fighting for, but it was hot air. It was never their intention to ensure that I was paid a fair wage for my efforts.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s the bottom-line, </strong> if I work hard and provide quality outcomes I expect to be paid commensurate with the result. I don&rsquo;t want to hear: &ldquo;hang in there&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rooting for you&rdquo; &ldquo;Budgets are tight&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybe next year&rdquo;. Women want this to change now- not in 2049 or 2178.</p><p> I say all of this to say leaning-in never increased my salary, asking for more never increased my salary and it had little to do with my ability or lack thereof to negotiate. The system in many companies is not geared to serve the interests of women or minorities for that matter. The companies that care and want to see everyone succeed do so because they start with good intentions, consistent action and passion for establishing fair workplace standards.</p><h3> I know many of you felt empowered Tuesday, but what are you doing about it today in your own businesses? I&rsquo;ll wait. </h3>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.&rdquo; &mdash; Tim Berners-Lee</p><p> The late 70&rsquo;s must have been a crazy time. Beyond just Jobs and Woz and Gates and Allen, there was  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Osborne\" target=\"_blank\">   Osborne  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin\" target=\"_blank\">   Bricklin  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Peddle\" target=\"_blank\">   Peddle  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell\" target=\"_blank\">   Bushnell  </a> </u> . They must have known they were at a tipping point but just couldn&rsquo;t quite sense the enormity of change that was about to take place. What emerged of course was  <strong>  the era of personal computing. </strong></p><p> The late 90&rsquo;s had a similar feel with  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\" target=\"_blank\">   Berners-Lee  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen\" target=\"_blank\">   Andreesen  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe\" target=\"_blank\">   Metcalfe  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Clark\" target=\"_blank\">   Clark  </a> </u> . Again, there was this sense of wonder, of a confluence of forces, of a gathering storm of technology and thought leaders who were putting the world together in new ways. There was no perfect prognostication of what was going to happen of course but there were clues and some wild speculation (remember Pets.com?). What developed was  <strong>  the era of connected computing. </strong></p><p> Since the 90&rsquo;s, technology has added so much and changed so much about how we live and work. Most significantly, our computers have become small and mobile. So today we&rsquo;re in a similar position with  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\">   Zuckerberg  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook\" target=\"_blank\">   Cook  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos\" target=\"_blank\">   Bezos  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk\" target=\"_blank\">   Musk  </a> </u> . Where are we headed? What will be the meme, the core paradigm of this next era? What&rsquo;s ahead is  the era of transcendent computing.</p><p> The roots of computing can be traced back to Blaise Pascal, the French mathematician and philosopher. His father was a tax supervisor, and in an attempt to help him speed up the laborious work of calculation, he built a mechanical calculator [1]. This was the first device that automated calculation and was really the first &ldquo;computer.&rdquo; The year was 1645, almost 500 years ago. Since then we&rsquo;ve gone from mechanical contraptions that were  massive, isolated, and cumbersome to electronic devices that are small, connected and delightful.</p><h3> The history goes kind of like this:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Mechanical; </strong> Pascal (mechanical calculator), Babbage (difference engine, analytical engine) <br/> <strong>  Electronic/Massive; </strong> Harvard Mark 1, ENIAC, UNIVAC <br/> <strong>  Big; </strong> mainframes (IBM 7000 series, IBM System/360), minicomputers (DEC PDP-1, DEC VAX/VMS) <br/> <strong>  Cumbersome; </strong> cables, punch cards, command line, DOS <br/> <strong>  Small; </strong> Commodore, Apple II, TRS80, Atari, IBM, Osborne, Mac, Amiga <br/> <strong>  Delightful; </strong> Xerox PARC, Lisa, Mac, NeXT, Windows, OSX, iOS, Android <br/> <strong>  Portable; </strong> URL, browser, Mosaic, HTML, WWW, Netscape, IE, web services, responsive web <br/> <strong>  Mobile; </strong> Newton, feature phone, Tablet PC, Symbian, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, iPhone, Android</p><p> In essence we&rsquo;ve gone from massive to small (size), isolated to connected (networked) and cumbersome to delightful (experience). Today these trends are converging to make computing transcend our location and our devices and simply be about  us , about  our  experience, about the dynamic flow of  our  life. Before the era of the personal computer, our lives were much less mechanized, automated or streamlined by devices. The network, computing, your &ldquo;extended brain&rdquo; if you will, really didn&rsquo;t exist. You were who you were without this  connected out of body Internet identity  being carried around. You didn&rsquo;t have a Facebook page, a Twitter handle, a LinkedIn profile. You were simply you.</p><p> The interesting and wonderful (perhaps) result of these present emerging forces is that they&rsquo;re pushing us full circle back to a time when our experiences were really personal, were really about us. The primary difference is that our computing experience is becoming &ldquo;always on.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s becoming transcendent.  Computing is becoming less of an extension of our life,  less something that we do task by task and more something that we are, less something popping in and out of our lives and more something that&rsquo;s ubiquitous, that&rsquo;s always there, that transcends our location or our immediate task.</p><p> How will this era form, how will it play out? Speculation abounds of course but there are many hints already visible. Currently we&rsquo;re each building our own personal presence on the Internet whether it&rsquo;s our identity (Facebook, LinkedIn), our ideas (Twitter, Pinterest) or just moments in time (SnapChat, Instagram). At different rates and in different ways, we&rsquo;re each accumulating data about our work, health, travel, relationships, careers, automobiles and homes.</p><p> In essence, we&rsquo;re each developing a &ldquo;personal cloud&rdquo; which is essentially a set of computing platforms constantly aware of our presence, always at the ready to host whatever personal APIs we give them permission for from  <u>  <a href=\"http://technologycreated.com/2015/01/13/the-internet-of-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;the Internet of YOU.&rdquo;  </a> </u>   These range from the deeply personal like our home, our car, our robot, our smartphone and our smartwatch to career-oriented platforms like our office or our work computer or retail platforms like stores and restaurants and banks.</p><p> With our identity traveling with us and being broadcast from us, many parts of our life will be automated simply by our presence. In other words, computation and automation will transcend location and computing platform. As we move through life, through our day, our computing experience will be woven across and through the &ldquo;things&rdquo; in our life.</p><p> <strong>  Retail; </strong> Your coffee shop, your grocery store, where you buy clothes, any retailers you choose will have a seamless personally designed connection to you knowing your preferences. <br/> <strong>  Financial; </strong> Your bank, your brokerage, your financial advisory, will dynamically keep you up to date, advising you, monitoring you, adjusting in real time to events in your life. <br/> <strong>  Health; </strong> Your health conditions will be dynamically monitored allowing you automated and seamless guidance on behaviors and healthy habits as well as detection of harmful events ahead. <br/> <strong>  Career; </strong> Your meetings, alerts, email, important issues, will flow in and out of your schedule and your presence in ways that you determine making it easier to react to important issues. <br/> <strong>  Social; </strong> People will move in and out of your day seamlessly whether it&rsquo;s that friend close by you gave permission to keep connected or that relative on another continent. <br/> <strong>  Presence; </strong> Your environment will adjust to your presence so as you approach your home, the temperature, music, lights, shades, and media will adjust to settings you&rsquo;ve taught it. <br/> <strong>  Travel; </strong> Your self-driving car will understand your schedule, your preferred routes, your insurance profile and your neighborhood and will make good decisions to get you places safely and on time. <br/> <strong>  Family; </strong> You will have constant access and insight into where your children are and what they&rsquo;re up to allowing you the chance to give them the guidance and security to turn into smart adult humans. <br/> <strong>  Insights; </strong>  A constant flow of data to approved guardians will give you dynamic insights into what&rsquo;s a good or bad next action including diet, exercise, friendship, career, knowledge, children. <br/> <strong>  Security; </strong> Your car will know who you are and unlock your door as you approach it and the same will go for your house, your office and your place of business. <br/> <strong>  Reputation; </strong> Finally, if you like, a new &ldquo;reputation score&rdquo; will be developed; like a credit score, it serves as an indicator about your future behavior, your insurability, your hirability, allowing employers, insurers or other institutions a basis for the true cost of a relationship with you.</p><p> This amazing computing journey that started in 1645 and brought us to and through personal computing and connected computing, now stands poised to blow the doors off those two eras with the era of transcendent computing. Who can predict where this perfect storm of technology and innovation will lead? Wherever it leads, we can surely say it will transform our lives in ways we can barely imagine!</p>",

    "content": "<p> The CEO of a company operating in a highly-competitive industry with high-maintenance clients who demand 24 x 7 availability and near-instant responsiveness sought employee feedback to foster an environment in which the team could work productively and consistently provide excellent customer care.</p><p> The CEO distributed an anonymous &ldquo;culture survey&rdquo; to employees, requesting candid feedback in support of &ldquo;creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere where people love coming to work.&rdquo; In addition, it was an outreach for &ldquo;creating an environment where people collaborate, are challenged to work hard and improve, and are accountable to themselves, the team and customers.&rdquo;</p><p> Traditionally, this CEO had adopted an &ldquo;up or out&rdquo; approach to individual success. Employees who flourished were those most agreeable to being at the beck and call of their boss and customers, and who regarded collaboration as &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; their peers&rsquo; ideas to further individual success. (This was hardly the healthiest of work environments!)</p><p> When survey responses came back, but before the data could be considered thoughtfully, the CEO impulsively sent two emails:</p><li> <strong>  To the Management Team:  </strong> Regarding personal time-off days (employees receive one day per month plus 10 days of vacation and holidays): &ldquo;So funny how different perceptions are to days off! I am so sick of hearing about how (employees) aren&rsquo;t able to take time off. Why don&rsquo;t they see it from my point of view? I am always covering for their sorry butts.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  To All Employees: </strong>  &ldquo;I am connected 24 x 7 as are some of you, which is awesome, and it probably meshes with your personality (all Type &lsquo;A&rsquo;s&rsquo; please raise your hands). But there are others that like &lsquo;their&rsquo; time, and that is great, too! No one is judging whether you did or didn&rsquo;t respond to an email sent at 10 pm. Please try to understand everyone has their own work habits and you should be focused on being secure in yours and doing the best job you can.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Working as a consultant with this company, I was privy to both emails. I immediately recognized the disconnect between the CEO&rsquo;s responses and his stated desire to build a healthy culture.</p><p> While on paper the days-off policy sounds great, the CEO&rsquo;s response suggests the intent of the policy is to lure people in only to discourage/judge them later for wanting time off. And when someone says &ldquo;no one is judging you,&rdquo; beware! Statements such as &ldquo;I am connected 24 x 7&rdquo; and &ldquo;there are others who like &lsquo;their&rsquo; time&rdquo; are implicitly judgmental. Similarly, the shout out to &ldquo;Type A&rsquo;s&rdquo; implies non-acceptance of others.</p><p> Great leaders need to realize if they ask for feedback from their employees, they must be sincere about it and take honest feedback into consideration. <strong>  Repercussions for insincerity can be disastrous. Employee motivation immediately evaporates and you create greater problems than simply having to field assorted complaints. </strong></p><p> If you reach out for feedback, view surveys as opportunities. They need not be long and arduous: one page and 10 or 12 questions will suffice.</p><h3> Here are some sample questions to get you started:</h3><p> <strong>  1. On a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest), indicate your agreement with the following: </strong></p><li> You are clear about the company&rsquo;s vision, mission and tactics.</li><li> You feel your ideas/suggestions regarding clients are heard and supported.</li><li> The organization has met your expectations as stated during recruiting and hiring.</li><li> You continue to trust and are confident management is making appropriate decisions.</li><li> You feel you can take time off without being judged.</li><li> You are satisfied with&hellip; <li>  your compensation package </li> <li>  the company&rsquo;s medical/life/dental insurance </li> <li>  the company&rsquo;s 401(K) </li> <li>  total days-off offered </li></li><p> <strong>  2. What three words best describe company culture? </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. How would you improve company culture? </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. What makes working here better or worse than other places? </strong></p><p> <strong>  5. Do you receive adequate feedback about your strengths and weaknesses? </strong></p><p> <strong>  6. Do you have the tools/skills necessary to do your job? If not, how would you improve this? </strong></p><p> <strong>  7. Do you receive adequate recognition for your work? </strong></p><p> <strong>  8. Do you feel you have opportunities to grow professionally? </strong></p><p> <strong>  9. Are there additional benefits or memberships (gym, yoga, daycare) you would like to see offered? </strong> <br/>  </p><p> Be clear about your organization&rsquo;s expectations and values, and then assemble a team capable of delivering the goods. If you really want to build your dream team, be sincere in your efforts to solicit and then use employee feedback. Otherwise, if you don&rsquo;t want to hear the answers, don&rsquo;t ask the questions. As the great leader Vince Lombardi&ndash;referring to his players that won five NFL championships, and a record three in a row that stands today&ndash;stated, &ldquo;Once you win their hearts, they&rsquo;ll follow you everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The choice is yours! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> While I can name several big brands that are killing it on Twitter for relationship building and engagement, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve actually seen one that&rsquo;s getting Facebook right. Sure, they invest quite a bit in making their business pages look great&mdash;they might even have a powerful content strategy for posting and curating things their audience finds valuable, and an ad budget to boot! But the one thing that all brands could be doing better on Facebook has nothing to do with cranking out more content or spending more money on ads&mdash;it&rsquo;s developing a one-on-one strategy.</p><h3> We&rsquo;re Lazy Marketers</h3><p> In my new book,  <u>  How to Look People in the Eye Digitally </u> , I talk a bit about how lazy we&rsquo;ve become as marketers. We want to get in front of a zillion people. We want to send them a bazillion messages. We feel pressured to publish lots of content. We want to do it all NOW. But we&rsquo;ve lost touch with how to listen to people&mdash;how to watch them when they&rsquo;re talking to us. People on social channels have become data points instead of human beings, and we spend way too much time trying to get something from them.</p><p> On Facebook we measure all those things we want to get from our audience whether it&rsquo;s likes, shares comments or clicks, but we miss the most important part&mdash;the ability to look into the life of a person and see what they&rsquo;re really about, and open up a one-on-one dialogue.</p><p> Granted, it&rsquo;s a little easier on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn, where everyone that&rsquo;s connected can see the other person&rsquo;s profile and browse their posts. But not everyone&rsquo;s on Twitter or LinkedIn. If your audience primarily hangs out on Facebook, that&rsquo;s where they want to converse with you. You need to find ways to get to know them there.</p><h3> Time to Get Personal</h3><p> I have a personal profile on Facebook, and I use it to get to know people. If you have a brand page, that&rsquo;s great&mdash;but someone on your staff needs to also leverage their personal page to &ldquo;friend&rdquo; members of your audience. This is a must, because watching a person&rsquo;s profile is the best way to find out what makes them tick, and to start up human-to-human conversations that build trust and loyalty.</p><p> Use it to reach out to people who have commented on a post or have sent a private message to you. Check out their &ldquo;about&rdquo; section, their photo albums, the places they&rsquo;ve been&mdash;and delve into their timeline to see what they like to share. Get a sense of them as a person.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re a CEO or a Customer Experience Manager, this exercise is invaluable. It reveals so much more about a person than you can glean from an email, message or phone call. Even from a purely informational perspective it&rsquo;s a goldmine, but don&rsquo;t stop there. Use what you learn to be more proactive at human business. Here are just a few ways you can leverage this knowledge:</p><li> <strong>  Research for product launch:  </strong> Pure listening helps build stronger buyer personas, which helps you design a better product or service.</li><li> <strong>  Survey customers to get feedback: </strong>  Personally reaching out to get honest feedback makes people feel valued. It&rsquo;s priceless!</li><li> <strong>  Give better customer service: </strong>  People just want to be heard, and have their concerns validated by another human being. If they reach out to you on Facebook&mdash;answer them there&mdash;and give it a human face.</li><li> <strong>  Nurture your best advocates: </strong>  The first step in developing an advocacy program is to reach out to each person who supports you. Make it personal. Let them know you appreciate them as an individual.</li><li> <strong>  Get to know new business friends:  </strong> Connecting on Facebook with people you&rsquo;ve just met in person or at an event is a great way to get to know them quickly and strengthen your professional relationship. <br/>  </li><p> Once you&rsquo;ve found out more about these people, take it to the next level. Keep track of them in Friend Lists. Like their posts. Comment on them. Share them. Ask questions or just say thanks. Once you&rsquo;re friends, Facebook&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-video-cards-for-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   video cards feature  </a> </u>  is a great way to send a personalized message of appreciation with the punch of a visual component.</p><p> In fact, going this extra mile to get to know your customers, vendors and others on Facebook can be a unique differentiator for you, simply because most brands aren&rsquo;t doing it. Whether you&rsquo;re a start-up restaurant owner like guys in the video below, or the head of a seasoned company looking for a way to stand out from the crowd, think about how you can turn connection into something more. Looking for ice breakers makes you more humanly engaging, and people will respond.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/AU-bycJt91A\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-15-at-3.44.33-PM.png\" width=\"852\"/> </a></p><p> These guys are definitely on the right track. Their passion is infectious, they&rsquo;re warm and personable, and they&rsquo;re excited about developing their &ldquo;uniqueness.&rdquo; If they can translate that into their social conversations and go the extra mile to get to know their followers on Facebook, it will go a long way towards building social advocacy&mdash;word of mouth on steroids.</p><p> Most brands aren&rsquo;t doing this, so you&rsquo;ll stand out if you put it into practice. This might mean dedicating some staff to the process, or earmarking a certain amount of time to it yourself. However, the rewards of deeper connection will soon become evident in better insight, more trust, improved brand perception in the marketplace and stronger relationships.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.returnonrelationship.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #RonR  </a> </u></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Lauren <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BubbleJobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @BubbleJobs   </a> </u></p><p> When you&rsquo;re in the process of applying for jobs, it soon becomes apparent that <strong>  what you&rsquo;re actually doing is selling yourself. </strong></p><p> This makes your job search much like a marketing campaign where you&rsquo;re trying to sell a product to a potential customer base &ndash; the only difference being that the product is you and the customer is the employer.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve identified this, your approach to job hunting will change and you should start seeing more interest in your applications.</p><p> So, how do you approach a job search like a marketing campaign? Well, here are some top tips on really selling yourself to an employer.</p><h3> Identify Your Audience</h3><p> Each application you send will be different depending on the sort of company that you&rsquo;re applying for, so it&rsquo;s vital that you&rsquo;re clear on the message you&rsquo;re trying to send before you start an application.</p><p> For example, if you&rsquo;re applying for a job at an agency, you&rsquo;ll want to highlight that you&rsquo;re versatile and able to work on multiple projects, whereas if you&rsquo;re going for a client-side position, you&rsquo;ll be more likely to focus on your specific skills that would benefit that particular company.</p><p> <strong>  Also, be sure to tailor your message based on the company&rsquo;s ethos and culture. </strong> For example, if they&rsquo;re a quirky business and appear quite informal, don&rsquo;t be afraid to be a bit off-the-wall with your application if it fits their brand. However, if you&rsquo;re applying for a job at a more corporate organisation, then a traditional format is probably more appropriate.</p><h3> Promote Your Unique Selling Points</h3><p> When you&rsquo;re marketing a product, the first thing you do is identify its USP and use this as the key part of the campaign &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not different when it comes to job searching.</p><p> Think about what certain experience or skill you have sets you apart from other candidates and use this as the basis of any application you send out.</p><p> Top Tip: Don&rsquo;t take a one-size-fits-all approach to this point. While something may be the ideal USP for one job, it won&rsquo;t necessarily do you any favours for a different role, so make sure you identify what makes you stand out based on each individual vacancy.</p><h3> List Your Core Values</h3><p> Any marketing campaign always communicates the core values of the business in its message, and that&rsquo;s something you should consider when putting together your job applications.</p><p> While technical skills are important, so is your personality and the softer skills that you possess, so make sure you mention these on your CV or cover letter.</p><p> If you can&rsquo;t think of any personal traits, ask colleagues or friends to describe you, or look at popular soft skills for people in similar positions. For example, if you&rsquo;re going for a sales role, you&rsquo;d probably say that you&rsquo;re results driven and good with numbers.</p><h3> Keep Track Of Your Activity</h3><p> Like any successful marketing campaign, it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep on top of any activity and the reception it receives.</p><p> Create a spreadsheet of all applications you send with the date sent, job advert link and status so you know where you&rsquo;re up to.</p><p> Also, make sure you ask for feedback from any unsuccessful applications so you can improve your job search in the future.</p><p> So there we go, some advice on how you can make your job search more like a marketing campaign.</p>",

    "link": "giving-your-event-social-media-air-cover",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "Whether you're organising, sponsoring or speaking at an event - or even just sending along members of your team as attendees - you're making an investment so it makes sense to do everything possible to extract maximum value from this.<p> When you think about it, the reasons why people use social media and the reasons why people attend events are largely the same. As a recent Business2Community article pointed out, <strong>  both are essentially platforms that allow people to connect, interact, learn and share things with peers or like-minded individuals. </strong></p><p> Their similarities mean that the two can be used together to great effect: <strong>  social media marketing can significantly boost event visitor numbers, drive footfall to your stand and boost views of your event-related content resources. </strong> You'll also be amazed how encouraging attendees to use social media during an event can quickly see your fan and follower numbers rise.</p><p> The basic idea of 'Social Media Air Cover' is to ensure that your on-the-ground-team, who are engaging 'hand-to-hand' at the event location, are backed up by a social media presence from &lsquo;above&rsquo; - whether on-site or back in the office - which multiplies vastly the number of connection opportunities and also can help sustain new relationships long after the event has finished.</p><p> While the events industry has become increasingly complex thanks to sophisticated event software and cloud platforms, social media can always be relied on to get as many people as possible engaging with you and helping you achieve your event objectives.</p><h3> So what&rsquo;s the plan?</h3><p> Once your goals have been set, it&rsquo;s important to put together a dedicated social media plan for the event. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be long or complicated, but should consider your target audience (who they are and what they want) and what social networks you should be allocating the most time and resources to.</p><p> And be sure to allocate team responsibilities in advance so that all involved know what&rsquo;s expected of them and when. You&rsquo;ll be amazed what a difference it can make to team members&rsquo; level of commitment and involvement just by having their name included in an event planning document. No doubt there&rsquo;s an element of both carrot and stick involved here&hellip;no one likes to be seen as the weakest link!</p><p> You should consider producing your own content - blog posts, videos, pre-planned tweets etc - that will be of practical use to event attendees and share any relevant content from other attendees that engages people and builds a conversation. And don't forget to use - or come up with, if it&rsquo;s your event - a good event hashtag to help spread your message.</p><h3> Connecting with the &lsquo;super-influencers&rsquo;</h3><p> For bigger events I would strongly recommend creating your own dedicated Twitter list of key event participants - organisers, speakers, sponsors clients, prospects, media - so that you can keep an extra-close eye on their social media activity throughout the event cycle. You&rsquo;ll never have a better chance of catching the eye and establishing connections with &lsquo;super-influencers&rsquo; than when you have mutual alignment and focus around a single event, with external stimuli and work priorities temporarily reduced or ignored.</p><h3> The event world&rsquo;s your oyster</h3><p> The other beauty of social media air cover, of course, is that you can even use it on events you're NOT attending in person, meaning that the sprawling events world suddenly becomes a much more manageable proposition altogether. In fact the opportunities to use social media in tandem with events to make your marketing budget go further suddenly become near-endless.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What is a &ldquo;Partnership Constitution&rdquo;?</h3>One of the advisors we interviewed for our white paper commented that he realized post-merger that a lot of discussions he had had with his potential partner during their transition period had not been captured in writing: big ideas, small ideas, as well as the vision of what the firm&rsquo;s culture would be.  A lot of  important decisions were addressed in the firm&rsquo;s Operating Agreement, of course.  But some of the ideas that emerged during their lengthy pre-merger discussions went undocumented.The Partnership Constitution picks up where the operating agreement leaves off, to capture what you agree will be your partnership&rsquo;s way of doing things including decision making, partnership roles, and conflict resolution.   It goes beyond a mission statement or a vision statement because it gets very specific about how the partners will work together and what they expect of each other.  You may discuss that no partner &ldquo;needs to be in the office all the time&rdquo; but as part of that you need to discuss and clarify what that actually means to all the partners in practice.  We have helped draft  partnership constitutions that referenced the &ldquo;how family members who work in the business will be handled&rdquo;  that was important to each partner, as well as another which required a minimum amount of vacation time.<h3> What are the benefits of having a Partnership Constitution?</h3>Clearly sets out the expectations, roles, and responsibilities all the partners have agreed to in writingIt can prevent misunderstandings and clarify hazy recollectionsSets you up to be proactive about conflictCan be amended when the partners realize that something is not working.Having a written record improves accountability.Captures decisions that are critical to the organization but are not part of the Operating Agreement.<h3> How Do I Create One?</h3>Start by individually identifying what your main interests are: what are the benefits you hope to get out of the partnership and what are you willing to compromise on? What strengths do your partners bring to the table?  What are your alternatives to this partnership? What are theirs?  Then, come together for a frank conversation to establish the shared vision of this partnership.For our clients, the partnership constitution is the written record of what has been uncovered and agreed to in our merger facilitation process.  All prospective partners go through a personality assessment that uncovers their behaviors, values and what motivates them.  The Partnership Constitution gives the partners a language they can use with each other. We have a checklist that ensures that the largest issues are raised, and then is supplemented by the specific issues raised during the facilitated conversations with the participation of all the partners.",

    "content": "<p> It is my belief that life coaches are everywhere. They have varying titles, however, such as relationship coach, nutrition coach, executive coach, wellness coach, business coach, and even fitness coach. No matter what they are called, they all serve the same purpose &ndash; <strong>  to make the lives of individuals better in different aspects of their lives. </strong></p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t tried working with a life coach yet, this may be a great time to do so. If you are going through some difficulties in your life, a coach will be someone who won&rsquo;t judge you for your past, but will help you build something better out of the things you have at present.</p><p> When it comes to choosing a life coach, it is vital that you choose one not just because his or her name appeared at the top of the search engine. These are the questions to ask when you&rsquo;re about to choose a life coach:</p><h3> What issues are you dealing with?</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t believe those life coaches that promise to be able to help you with everything you&rsquo;re dealing with. You&rsquo;ve got to ask yourself first so you may identify which particular aspect of your life needs changing or improving. Do you want to be happier? Do you want more wealth? Do you want to land a good job? Knowing your specific needs will make it easier for you to find the right coach for you.</p><h3> What type of certification or training did the coach get?</h3><p> In many countries in the world, the coaching industry remains ungoverned by a specific body or authority. Thus, anyone can claim they are a life coach although the only education they got is through watching videos and reading life coaching books.</p><p> To avoid being fooled by someone pretending to be a real life coach, you need to get as much information as you can in terms of the kind and length of the coach&rsquo;s training. You want to be with someone who has undertaken significant coursework and has vast experience in a particular field.</p><h3> Are you willing to make the necessary changes in your life?</h3><p> Your coach is neither your friend nor your mother. A life coach is someone who will want to know your goals in life, and will be there to help you achieve all your goals. He or she may even be very strict so that you may stretch yourself beyond your capacity. Personal life coaches find ways to make their clients become aware of their options, and equip them with the wisdom and confidence to make the right choices. When working with a life coach, you&rsquo;ve got to be open to change.</p><h3> How would you know that life coaching is working in your favor?</h3><p> A good and experienced life coach will enable you to set goals which are also aligned to your personal values and intentions. If you eventually feel that there is some sort of clarity in your head in terms of what you want to accomplish and how you are going to accomplish them, then <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/individuals/life-coaching/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   life coaching  </a> </u> is definitely working for you.</p>",

    "content": "<strong> Online social networks are changing how businesses and their leaders communicate and leverage their most valuable asset: their relationships.</strong>In this series of articles, entitled <u> <a href=\"http://jaypalter.ca/tag/new-rules-of-engagement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  New Rules of Engagement </a></u>, I profile a business leader that I have observed to be using social networks actively and effectively in their leadership role.This week, I talk with Bill Sullivan, Head of Global Financial Services Intelligence for Capgemini.<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EMsGSxUvpbw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-16-at-12.07.25-PM.png\" width=\"1200\"/></a><strong> Bill Sullivan</strong>Head of Global Financial Services MarketIntelligence,<u> <a href=\"https://www.ca.capgemini.com/financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Capgemini </a></u><u> LinkedIn Profile</u>Twitter -<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WFSULLIVAN3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  @WFSULLIVAN3 </u></a><h3> <strong>  Jay Palter (JP): </strong> Why do you invest your limited time to engage in social networks?</h3><strong> Bill Sullivan (BS):</strong> Relatively speaking, I am a newbie when it comes to social media networking at a professional level. I had been on LinkedIn for many years, but really only to stay in touch with old colleagues and clients. I joined Facebook about 6 years ago, but that was largely to stay in touch with friends and family when we moved abroad to India for three years with my wife and daughters in 2009.I have to give credit to my company for providing the initial spark to get on Twitter. Capgemini started an innovative program called &ldquo;Expert Connect&rdquo; with the objective of creating a bank of experts to drive business influence via thought leadership and expert advice. The program was based on the amplification power of Social Media, leveraging the individual network of key influencers for business and branding purposes.As part of the program, in addition to my LinkedIn account, I had to either add a Twitter account or a Blog (two separate social media profiles were required to participate in the program). That&rsquo;s how I got started. I opened my Twitter account less than two years ago in 2013. For the first 6-9 months, I did very little with the account as I didn&rsquo;t see the immediate value.It took some time, but I finally found the style and approach that best fit me personally, and was able to achieve some tangible benefits. In my current role as Global Head of Market Intelligence for <u> <a href=\"https://www.ca.capgemini.com/financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Capgemini Financial Services </a></u>, I&rsquo;m responsible for the full portfolio of Capgemini&rsquo;s financial services thought leadership, as well as overseeing all of our financial services-related strategic research and analysis that is used both internally to support our Capgemini financial services business leaders (global trends, market analysis, competitor intelligence, account intelligence, etc) and to support our client engagements.I manage all of my personal social media activity on my own, although I leverage some content recommendations from my Capgemini Social Media partner. There are three core drivers that motivate my engagement in social networking.<li> It is incredible how valuable Twitter and LinkedIn can be (if you are looking in the right places) to find the latest on industry trends, announcements, expert opinions, news, and thought leadership. This probably represents the bulk of my efforts in social networking, both in terms of gathering information for my own use, as well as sharing content with my network (and my team). When engaging in social networks, it is critical to spend as much (if not more) efforts sharing and providing value as you do in promoting your own self interests.</li><li> A second objective is promoting my own and my team&rsquo;s original content, as well as building our overall Capgemini brand. I believe Capgemini produces some of the industry leading, global thought leadership in the Financial Services sector with publications like our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.worldwealthreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Wealth Report  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.worldpaymentsreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Payments Report  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.worldretailbankingreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Retail Banking Report  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.worldinsurancereport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Insurance Report  </a> </u> , and other smaller white papers and points of view. The combination of leveraging our deep domain expertise from our global financial services experts, our senior executive contacts/clients at the largest financial institutions across the Americas, Europe, and APAC, and our extensive proprietary primary research customer surveys result in thought leadership that is highly valued by our clients. My social networking engagement has provided a great channel to promote that work and Capgemini&rsquo;s capabilities to existing and potential clients, tier 1 media, trade publications, and industry influencers.</li><li> Last, but not least, is the actual social networking. I have had a great opportunity to engage with a wide range of social financial services influencers and industry experts through Twitter. It has provided a great two-way street in terms of expanding my network which I can lean on for input, while also providing me a chance to share valuable insights and perspectives.</li><h3> <strong>  JP:  </strong> What social networks or tools do you consider essential and why?</h3><strong> BS:</strong> Over the last 12 months, Twitter has been my core social media network. I feel Twitter provides a fluid, social element to social networking. I have slowly been increasing my use of LinkedIn, especially as the content publishing mechanism has really advanced. The LinkedIn groups can also be really valuable in two-way sharing of information, but I haven&rsquo;t fully leveraged it to-date.I primarily use three basic tools. The first tool is Twitter Lists for &ldquo;listening&rdquo;. If you have really strong lists set up, you&rsquo;ll have a robust, continuous stream of valuable content covering a wide range of trends, stats, news, and some heated debates on burning issues. Second, in terms of sharing content or following live events, the use of hashtags is also really valuable. We use custom hashtags for each of our major thought leadership launches, as well as key sponsored events. Lastly, the tool I use the most is the Buffer widget (on Chrome, my iPad, and my phone). <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Buffer</a> has been a great time saver in scheduling my own content and for spreading out my sharing of content throughout the day.<h3> <strong>  JP: </strong>  What techniques or habits have you developed to make time in your busy schedule for social?</h3><strong> BS:</strong> I find the key to successful social networking is not dissimilar to other personal or work activities. You need to dedicate time and prioritize efforts to the point where it becomes a habit. However, as with any activity, the more you do it the more efficient you become. I typically try to carve out 3 slots during the day for social media. I start every day over my first cup (or two) of coffee for about 30 minutes going through the feed of my go-to Twitter list, Buffering interesting articles, scheduling any original content I had planned for the day, reviewing all the notifications that came in overnight, and responding to different contacts. I also take a look at LinkedIn for recent posts/stories from my network. Lastly, I also try to tweet a thank you to individuals for their recent engagement (RTs, Mentions, etc). I&rsquo;ll typically find another 30 minutes over lunch to run through the same process and another block in the evening once my daughters have gone to bed. When I&rsquo;m traveling, I spend a lot of my free time in airports, cabs, and downtime in hotels scanning for any interesting articles and dialogues. Overall, I probably only spend 60-90 minutes a day. However, I see that time as really well spent not only for the sharing and promoting, but it&rsquo;s really the equivalent of me reading the local paper that is essentially personally customized for my own professional and personal interests. The value I get back from the time invested is well worth it.<img alt=\"\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bill-sullivan-twitter.png\" width=\"910\"/><h3> <strong>  JP: </strong>  What specific benefits would you attribute to your social networking activities?</h3><strong> BS:</strong> The benefits I can attribute to my social networking activities fall along the 3 objectives for why I participate.<li> To Gain Knowledge &ndash; My team spends a lot of money on external research. Yet, I find much of the secondary research we have used over the past year has come through contacts I follow on my Twitter lists. My social media activity has really helped keep me abreast of the latest trends, news, and events in the industry.</li><li> Promote My Own Thought Leadership &ndash; Over the past year, we have seen a huge uptick in Tier 1 media, trade publications, and industry bloggers covering our thought leadership findings or using data from our reports. We have seen a multiplier effect from our strategic use of social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and Slideshare) for every thought leadership rollout and global campaign.</li><li> Professional Networking &ndash; I have built some great virtual relationships over the past year. And through those networks, I have had a great opportunity to be invited to speak at industry events, join industry panels at conferences, serve as a judge for well known global industry awards, and much more.</li><h3> <strong>  JP: </strong> What&rsquo;s one piece of advice that you have for your peers about social networking?</h3><strong> BS:</strong> Don&rsquo;t forget the &ldquo;social&rdquo; part of social networking. One of the biggest mistakes individuals and firms make when stepping into social networking professionally is they think it&rsquo;s all about them. They see it as just another one-way channel to promote their own business, or brand, or thought leadership. It&rsquo;s true, if done effectively, you can absolutely do all of those things. However, that can&rsquo;t be the only goal/approach. That isn&rsquo;t how social networking works. Social networking is about building relationships. It&rsquo;s about having others see the value that you provide to your network. It takes time and consistency to build that value, trust, and brand.<h3> Key Takeaways</h3>When I first met Bill (online, of course) and spoke to him about his social networking activities, I was very interested in the internal Capgemini thought leadership program referred to above. Individual social networking and positive results in the field requires leadership and support for those activities at the corporate level.I also think that Bill&rsquo;s integration of his social networking activities into his work-day is a key factor in his success. His 30-30-30 rule of 30 minutes in the morning, 30 minutes over lunch and 30 minutes in the evening is instructive for many business executives trying to incorporate social into their routines.Finally, don&rsquo;t forget to be social in your social networking. After all, as Bill points out, it&rsquo;s not just about promoting yourself but also the value you offer to your network.",

Pretty soon, no one&rsquo;s using the investment and all the incremental sales you baked into the business case are a pipe dream.</p><p> When people REALLY need an exception, they need an exception. But, most of the time they yearn for consistency. Here are three ways to show up as a human and stay true to your vision.</p><h3> Explain Your Leadership Viewpoint</h3><p> Try something like this: &ldquo;I believe in situational leadership and doing the right thing for people in trying situations. I can&rsquo;t always disclose WHY I&rsquo;m chosing to make an exception, but please know that if I do, there&rsquo;s a private matter at hand that we&rsquo;re working through. Other than that, I&rsquo;ll be working to be as consistent as possible. I trust that you will understand that so I can maintain the same flexibility when you have an extreme situation. In order to make this work, I need everyone staying true to our game plan.&rdquo;</p><h3> Know Consistency is Valued</h3><p> In every company I work with I hear a consistent theme in focus groups:  &ldquo;I wish our managers had tougher and more consistent standards. We&rsquo;d be so much better if they consistently reinforced the requirements.&rdquo; I hear that 10 times more than &ldquo;My manager is too hard on us.&rdquo;</p><p> Chances are everyone is rooting for you to take a stand.  Be human, but often the most fair and reasonable answer is to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to deviant behavior.</p><h3> Invite Your &ldquo;A Players&rdquo; to Be Role Models Not Exceptions</h3><p> Your &ldquo;A Players&rdquo; feel they deserve special treatment. Give it to them. Invite them to help you solve the bigger problem, not stay on the outskirts. If you doubt this can be done, call me. The biggest turnarounds have always involved getting the prima donnas to help for the greater good.</p><p> Once your team is headed down a slippery slope, it&rsquo;s darn impossible to get them moving uphill. Your team is yearning for leadership, parameters and consistency, with the occassional human exception. Approach these situations with the confidence that your vision is important, and the humility to know when their situation warrants an exception.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Are your customers raving fans or fairweather fans? </strong> <br/> <br/> Given that it's the start of the baseball season, it was timely (albeit, intentionally so) that I received details about  <u>  <a href=\"http://brandkeys.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brand Keys  </a> </u> ' 23rd annual Sports Fan Loyalty survey results a few days ago. <br/> <br/> Brand Keys interviewed 250 self-declared fans in each baseball team's area; insights from the interviews were designed to enable league and team management to identify improvement areas. <br/> <br/> The top five and bottom five teams are as follows, with last year's ranking in parentheses: <br/> <br/> <strong>  Top 5 Teams - 2015 Rankings </strong> <br/> 1. St. Louis Cardinals (#1) <br/> 2. San Francisco Giants (#5) <br/> 3. Los Angeles Dodgers (#6) <br/> 4. Detroit Tigers (#6) <br/> 5. Washington Nationals (#8) <br/> <br/> <strong>  Bottom 5 Teams - 2015 Rankings </strong> <br/> 30. Houston Astros (#30) <br/> 29. Arizona Diamondbacks (#21) <br/> 28. Colorado Rockies (#26) <br/> 27. New York Mets (#22) <br/> 26. Texas Rangers (#19) <br/> <br/> Their research gives teams an apples-to-apples comparison of the emotional intensity with which fans support their home team versus corresponding fans of other teams in that market. They note that team win/loss ratios only drive about 20% of fan loyalty. The final score isn't the only thing that matters to fans; there are four other factors that come into play when they calculate their loyalty score:</p><li> <strong>  Pure Entertainment: </strong> How exciting is their game?</li><li> <strong>  Authenticity: </strong> The press release defined it as, how well do they play as a team? Examples given were  a new stadium and new managers. Given that, and the label itself, it might be better to define this as being real or delivering on the brand promise. Do they do right by their fans and their players?</li><li> <strong>  Fan Bonding: </strong> Are the players respected and admired?</li><li> <strong>  History and Tradition: </strong> Is the game part of community rituals, institutions, and beliefs? <br/>  </li><p> That's all really interesting. But it got me thinking about  <strong>  raving fans </strong>  vs.  <strong>  fairweather fans </strong> . If you've been reading my blog for a while, you know the things I've said repeatedly about raving fans (think about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/02/do-you-have-12th-man-advantage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Seahawks' 12th Man  </a> </u> ), with some new additions; they...</p><li> want to see the brand succeed and grow</li><li> are happy to provide feedback, good or bad, to ensure that that success happens</li><li> are less price sensitive</li><li> require less support because they are more familiar with your products </li><li> choose your brand over the competition</li><li> can't live without your brand and accept no substitutes</li><li> are advocates or, even stronger, evangelists, spreading the word about your brand</li><li> wear your brand, and want to show that they are part of something bigger than themselves </li><li> openly recruit new members to the community</li><li> are more likely to be using several of your products/services, not just one </li><li> care about each other, want to help each other</li><li> feel like they belong to something bigger than themselves (think \"tribe\") </li><li> wait in line - long lines, early morning lines - to buy your products</li><li> elevate your brand, affording you favorable placement in stores and more  <br/>  </li><p> But what about fairweather fans? What's their deal? Do brands have fairweather fans, too? Well, let's start with a definition, as I like to do. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-fairweather-fan.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wiseGEEK  </a> </u> , a fairweather fan is...  <br/> <br/> ...someone who is only interested in a sports team when it is doing well. ... A fairweather fan tends to root for the team that is doing well, ignoring that team if it starts to fail and sometimes switching loyalties, even to an opponent.  <br/> <br/> When it comes to the customer experience, how does that translate? Fairweather fans...</p><li> might be a fan because friends are, but they are not necessarily loyal/committed/devoted</li><li> are fans because the brand is popular, not because of their own experiences or love for the brand </li><li> might be a fan - or just buy from the brand - when there are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/02/discounts-sabotage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   deals or coupons  </a> </u></li><li> remind me of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2011/11/black-friday-vs-cx-journey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mercenaries  </a> </u>  segment of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/02/apostle-model.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apostle Model  </a> </u></li><li> don't provide feedback or may only do so when things go bad </li><li> head to the competition at the first sign of anything going wrong/bad</li><li> continue to buy other brands, as well, since they aren't committed to only purchasing/using your brand </li><li> can't necessarily articulate why they love your brand</li><li> are excited about \"the big game,\" e.g., launch of Apple Watch, but aren't always cheering for them during the regular season, e.g., don't purchase or use all or many other Apple products</li><li> take offense if you call them fairweather fans, yet know deep down that that's what they are</li><li> brag and talk big about \"their team (brand)\" when things are going well but are the first to defect when the chips are down (product problems, bad service, etc.) <br/>  </li><p> Brands do have fairweather fans, much more so than raving fans. How do companies feel about them? Sadly, and quite honestly, they love them. If they can re-engage a customer - any customer - by offering  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/02/discounts-sabotage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   coupons and discounts  </a> </u>  or by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/directv-rob-lowe-ad-asked-pulled-after-comcast-complaint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   gimmicky advertising  </a> </u> , then they can perpetuate the focus on acquisition over retention. And we all know that this is the focus of too many companies today - to simply make a buck, regardless of how they achieve it. But eventually,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/01/why-customers-really-leave.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fairweather customers will leave  </a> </u> , as all fairweather fans do. <br/> <br/> Is there a spectrum of fans, where raving is the extreme? What other fan types are there? Which would you prefer?  <br/> <br/> Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down. -Oprah Winfrey</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I like going to the dentist. Does that tell you all you need to know to stop reading?  I recognize, however, and with great understanding, that most people do not like sitting in that narrow leather chair with a light in your eyes, fingers and instruments in your mouth and the occasional request to \"spit.\" It is at best uncomfortable, and at worse, a paralyzing fear for some.</p><p> Have you asked the clients you serve how they feel about their annual (or semi-annual) visit with you? Do they feel uncomfortable, frustrated or even perhaps fearful of the encounter?  Ask them, they will tell you.</p><p> Ok, we don't draw blood or use laughing gas or reek of latex but the research says many clients find it unpleasant to meet with you or even trust you enough to \"give\" you more of their very emotional, real and significant family wealth.</p><p> It is widely known that the average financial adviser has less than 60% of high-net-worth clients' assets.  Furthermore, for those clients with more than 5 million dollars in investable assets, they have nearly 7 different advisers managing those assets.</p><p> In addition, we know that more than 80% of clients who will inherit some of the $40 trillion that is moving over the next 20 years will select a different wealth adviser to manage that wealth than the one who built it.</p><p> Perhaps why some of our clients won't take our call as often as we'd like or won't come into see you or better yet, will not bring their spouse in with them is for similar reasons why some people don't go to the dentist - they hate the experience!  It's uncomfortable and personal. It may be a bit painful at times.  It's concerning and causes more thought and work for everyone involved.</p><p> We can all agree that semi-annual visits and teeth cleanings are the best preventative action you can take to reduce tooth decay, gum disease and now the medical community tells us heart disease.   However, there are still people out there that will not go to the dentist. It's not the cost, because most employee plans include dental visits. It's the fact that they don't like the experience. They don't like it because of past experience.  They don't like it because of their concern for the future.  They simply are afraid.</p><p> If your clients and prospects don't like the experience of seeing you, how can you save them from themselves? How can you provide the excellent investment, wealth and legacy advice and service that you and I know will keep their portfolios clean, healthy and strong? Enough with the dental analogies!</p><p> Recently, however, I learned a valuable lesson from my dentist.  As I sat in my dentist's chair and had an old filling replaced and a new crown put on, I noticed the dentist and the assistant did something new-or perhaps I had never paid attention to their process before. </p><p> As the 60 minute procedure took place <strong>  they told me everything they were doing, were going to do, why they were doing it and about how long it would take. In other words, they did not let me create a false fear, or draw conclusions that most likely would not occur. Said another way, they walked me through everything they knew would occur in this time of uncertainty and anxiousness for me.  </strong></p><p> Do you have clients who are uncertain and anxious about the markets, their portfolios, retirement or their generational wealth? Do you have clients in real pain?  <strong>  The reality is how you manage or don't manage that pain really will make all the difference. </strong> It will set you apart good or bad.</p><p> In Malcolm Gladwell's book  <u>  Blink </u> , he shares an extraordinary study of the correlation of a medical doctor's bedside manner and his or her likelihood of being sued for malpractice.  The incredible part of the story is that being sued for malpractice has less to do with the technical proficiency of the doctor but much more to do with the bedside manner-their  passion, compassion and care. </p><p> Furthermore, Gladwell discovered that the perceived better bedside manner occurred from patients when the doctor had just three more minutes of conversation with the patient.  So, three more minutes of genuine, caring conversation means a doctor is less likely to be sued than a doctor who is technically more proficient, but perceived as less caring, compassionate, and does not take the time to know his or her patient.  What does this have to do with you? Everything!</p><p> So let's simply use this experience I had in the dentist chair to create or in most cases for you, re-create a positive connection with the clients you serve to get them comfortable or dare I say, even enjoying this painful, uncertain experience in life. The more you do that, the more trusted you will be.  Now that's noble.</p><p> <strong>  Tell them what you are going to do, why you are going to do it, what they can expect and how long it will take. </strong> And then tell them again and again and again. Don't keep them in the dark or worse, don't argue with them that there is nothing to worry about or that there is no pain. There is real pain, accept that and manage it.</p><p> Walk them through the intimate process of wealth building that you know so well and actually can deliver to them. You are the reassuring, proficient, caring professional that they need and want. Keep it simple. Communicate often and openly. Create intimacy!</p><p> Go and be noble because what you do is noble.  I firmly believe that funding people's retirements, helping them buy second homes, funding their children's colleges and building generational wealth is noble and you are involved in a noble calling.</p><p> And by the way, our teeth won't be needed when we pass on, but the wealth that you provide the next generation will. So build it with not just intellect but with compassion, emotion and intimacy.  </p>",

Myriad possible explanations for retiring later include the decline of traditional pensions, greater longevity, healthier older workers, and a more educated labor force.</p><p> Another reason could be the 1983 reform delaying the age at which baby boomers in this country are allowed to claim their full Social Security pensions, a reason supported by a  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panel-7_2-Lalive-and-Staubli1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new study  </a> </u>  of similar reforms to Switzerland&rsquo;s government pensions.</p><p> The researchers found that a one-year increase in Switzerland&rsquo;s full retirement age, or FRA, for women is associated with a half-year delay in when women retire and when they claim their full government pensions.</p><p> Both the Swiss and U.S. federal pension reforms have raised their respective FRAs by two years.  Social Security&rsquo;s FRA is gradually increasing from age 65 to 67 over more than two decades and started with workers born in 1938.  The Swiss reform in 1997 increased the FRA only for women in two quick steps &ndash; from 62 to 63 for women born between 1939 and 1941 and from 63 to 64 for those born in 1942 or later.

    "content": "<h3> What the Investment Industry Can Learn from the Nutrition World</h3><p> Lately, we&rsquo;ve seen a proliferation of articles touting the end of active investing and the beginning of the age of low-cost indexing. I believe that this is exactly the wrong message to send at the wrong time. Long-term investing should be like a well-balanced meal: plenty of protein, vegetables and some healthy carbs too. In our world, it&rsquo;s about healthy allocations of stocks, bonds, and alternatives and a well-balanced mix of investment methodologies, namely active and passive approaches. The overarching goal should be to focus on what really matters: helping the client to achieve his or her personal goals and objectives.</p><h3> Three Things Investment Professionals Can Learn from the Nutrition World</h3><p> <strong>  A Well-Rounded, Personalized Plan Is the Best Bet for Long-Term Success </strong></p><p> There are no shortcuts. If someone is looking to lose weight, diet and exercise should be tailored to his or her individual needs in order to improve the likelihood of success. For example, a mainly sedentary, overweight individual should probably not jump right into an extreme exercise plan. Nor should they practice extreme dieting.</p><p> Investments are the same way. Without diversification, portfolio risk goes us up and we can be tempted to put all of our assets into a single investment style or the asset class outperforming its peers at a given time. When we search for short cuts, we can easily lose track of the long-term benefits of investing and make bad decisions in the here and now.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s a Lifestyle, Not a Fad</h3><p> Fad diets (we&rsquo;ve all heard of the grapefruit diet and the cookie diet) leave the body malnourished and can lead to the development of harmful habits.</p><p> The same holds true for one&rsquo;s investment allocation. Cutting out one style or type of investment entirely in favor of another can increase risk and derail an investor&rsquo;s long-term plan. A more moderate, diversified approach has a higher likelihood of success. It&rsquo;s all about creating good habits, because bad habits can slowly build up and undermine the chances of achieving one&rsquo;s goals. As Warren Buffet said, &ldquo;Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.&rdquo;</p><p> My point is that ditching an active approach in favor of a passive approach is shortsighted and vice versa. In our view, ditching an asset class entirely, such as fixed income, and loading up on alternatives may also be shortsighted. We believe healthy mix of both positions the client for a less frenzied experience and reduces the risk of loading up on too much of a good thing.</p><h3> Knowledge Is Power &ndash; Know What You Are Buying and Who You Are Buying It From</h3><p> The 2008 documentary Food, Inc. by filmmaker Robert Kenner shed light on some of the food industry&rsquo;s less savory characteristics &mdash; namely corporate farming&rsquo;s loss of integrity, quality and safety in the race to produce more food for less money. He argued that the public didn&rsquo;t really know what they were consuming because they had lost touch with the farmer and the food production process.</p><p> In the investment world, it&rsquo;s important to do your research on your manager. Knowing who is managing your assets may help you avoid negative surprises in the future. When researching managers, it may be helpful to ask the following questions: How long have they been in the business? What is the overall firm structure? Has the investment manager had the experience that comes from managing in different market cycles, market regimes and difficulties?</p><p> These are all things to consider in addition to the classical risk measures of a manager such as standard deviation, beta and alpha.</p><h3> Keeping the Focus on What Matters: The Client&rsquo;s Goals and Objectives</h3><p> The fight between active and passive should not be the focal point of financial planning. Rather, the client should be at the center of every decision.</p><p> I would argue that the focus on active vs. passive, or &ldquo;this-or-that,&rdquo; is a Wall Street rather than a Main Street ideology &mdash; which stock to buy, what market to short, how to exploit an opportunity for all it&rsquo;s worth before the markets move into the next big idea.</p><p> A client-centered approach doesn&rsquo;t allow for a dichotomy of methodologies or for the distractions that arise from the wholehearted shutting out of either time-tested approach. They complement each other. Case in point, Eugene Fama who advocates passive investing and Robert Shiller, a proponent of active investing, both won Nobel Prizes in the same year.</p><p> Outcome-oriented investing supports the theory that good habits lead to long-term success. In the nutrition world, a well-rounded, diversified diet can help increase one&rsquo;s quality of life and extend one&rsquo;s life. In the investment world, a well-rounded, diversified portfolio can help keep clients focused on what matters and increase the likelihood that they will have successful financial outcomes.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently watched a movie called &lsquo;Her&rsquo; starring Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson. Set in the future the beautiful, strange and emotional story of a letter writer, Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) who, after separating from his girlfriend, downloads an intelligent computer operating system (OS) personified through a female voice, &lsquo;Samantha&rsquo; played by Johansson.</p><p> Director Spike Jonze conceived the idea of the film after reading about Cleverbot, a web application that uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to have conversations with humans.</p><p> Twombly had quite simply created his &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; woman. He had answered a few questions; What gender was he? What gender did he want? What was his relationship like with his mother, etc and then suddenly Samantha&rsquo;s sultry, and endearingly shy voice is heard. A partner. All clean and new. Void of emotional baggage. Void of transference or counter transference or id or super ego or ego or any of that. I wonder what Freud, Jung, Lacan, Klein and the like would think of this.</p><p> If we&rsquo;re going to use article intelligence technology to create the &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; partner then based on a psychological analysis and view perhaps the answer lies in tapping into the reductionist psychology, to simply align each separate component with the AI and thus creating the perfect partner.</p><p> Moving away from psychology and into the realms and the future of artificial intelligence in Hong Kong an AI has become the world&rsquo;s first company director.</p><p> 'In a world first, Japanese venture capital firm Deep Knowledge recently named an artificial intelligence (AI) to its board of directors.</p><p> The robot, named Vital, was chosen for its ability to pick up on market trends &lsquo;not immediately obvious to humans&rsquo;.</p><p> &lsquo;The bot has already helped make two major investment decisions in life science companies, Pathway Pharmaceuticals and InSilico Medicine.&rsquo;</p><p>  In Japan they are even looking into how an AI could generate stories from ideas already written by the late author Shinichi Hoshi who died in 1997. Could an AI eventually write a novel? Is that conceivably possible? Surely all the classics, the sonnets, the novels ever written were borne from human experience, love, loss, hate, life..? Does this blow the very foundation of literature out the window?</p><p> So, if these AI&rsquo;s are becoming more and more &lsquo;human&rsquo; would it be feasibly possible to fall in love with one? And just say we did, would that be so bad? A partner who loves us unconditionally, void of an emotional baggage that might clash with ours. A partner to whom we can tell our deepest secrets to, a partner who will never leave us, who will never be unfaithful, who will truly understand us. Isn&rsquo;t that what we all want? Of course, the relationship will also be void of physicality but can we put that aside for all the other attributes of this perfect relationship? Would all the other positives balance the lack of physicality out?</p><p> Many of us have internet relationships or cyberships. These are relationships between people online. In many cases this is the only way people know each other. Is this bad? It&rsquo;s not dissimilar to pen pals though if you think about it. I had a pen pal at school. We were designated one. She was from another country, France if I recall. We wrote to each other regularly about our lives, what we had done that week, our families, our friends. So now we do it online. No difference really. I didn&rsquo;t know her, she didn&rsquo;t know me and we never met. Cyberships can often be more honest and open. The fear of divulging a secret is diminished because the person isn&rsquo;t present. Not similar to Twombly and &lsquo;Samantha&rsquo;. So was Twombly wrong or odd or unhinged to fall in love with a computer? Are cyberships or virtual relationships unhealthy? Are they affecting us cognitively? Are they changing us as human beings? Will our wants and needs change as we delve deeper and deeper into virtual worlds? I think, whether we like it or not we will soon find out&hellip;</p>",

    "link": "on-the-destructive-power-of-dysfunctional-teams-implications-for-managers",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Teamwork is a word that has been thrown around quite a lot in recent years. Managers want only the best people on their teams, teamwork skills are a new must for any decent resume, employees are required to participate in team-building activities as the part of their training process, and in business schools, team-based projects are becoming exceedingly more popular with the teaching faculty. Despite all the coverage teamwork gets, a team that actually works is the aurora borealis of the business world: heart-stoppingly beautiful but scarce and transient.</p><p> Well-tuned, productive teams are worth their weight in gold to management and business owners. They ensure that things get done and that business thrives as the result of the team&rsquo;s input and efforts. It is easy to recognize those top-performing teams without much investigation; employees and management are on the same page, internal communications run smoothly, conflicts are resolved promptly, and most importantly, the company&rsquo;s and the clients&rsquo; interests are invariably prioritized.</p><p> Dysfunctional teams are equally easy to spot. In some of the most blatant cases one can almost physically sense the chaos and hostility that enshroud the team; people moving on autopilot, a great deal of ignoring of one another, some bitter remarks and distrustful body language here, more passive-aggressive sort of attitude there, and &ndash; voila! &ndash; a dysfunctional team successfully identified. Some of the other characteristics of dysfunctional teams include, but certainly are not limited to, backstabbing, finger-pointing, gossiping, bullying, avoidance of responsibility and accountability, absence of trust in one another and confidence in management, non-commitment, defensiveness, perceived and actual favoritism, and groupthink.</p><p> Managers and business owners everywhere turn prematurely grey thinking about how detrimental dysfunctional teams may be to their business. Damage can be inflicted in three major ways:</p><li> Low revenues, declining profits &ndash; a result of waning employee productivity, since instead of working, employees spend time agonizing over relationships or are too busy trying to lynch one another to care for the interests of the company;</li><li> Loss of key personnel &ndash; dysfunctional teams are maelstroms of all-embracing chaos, hence many talented employees leave, unable to function in such a destructive environment;</li><li> Blemished reputation &ndash; warring employees can go as far as sabotaging one another, hurting the company in the process, and with the current state of communications technology, news, as well as rumors, travel at the speed of light, letting just about the whole world know what is going on inside the company. <br/>  </li><p> How widespread is this phenomenon? Extremely.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.phoenix.edu/news/releases/2013/01/university-of-phoenix-survey-reveals-nearly-seven-in-ten-workers-have-been-part-of-dysfunctional-teams.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Results of a national survey conducted by the University of Phoenix  </a> </u>  reveal that nearly 70%, or seven out of every ten people who have ever worked on a team, at one point or another have been part of dysfunctional teams. Despite the fact that 95% of those surveyed acknowledge the importance of teams in the workplace, only a meager quarter would volunteer to work as part of one. These numbers also tell us that dysfunctional teams do not necessarily spell negligent or incompetent employees, as some managers mistakenly believe. Factors that facilitate the rise of disorderly teams are numerous, disparate, and generally can be divided into two broad categories:</p><li> management-induced</li><li> employee-induced <br/>  </li><p> Poor management may potentially be a root cause of disorderly workplace environment; it confuses and exasperates employees who otherwise could be performing much better. If management is lagging, even the best teams are doomed to consistently underperform, due to the lack of any sense of stability, confidence and direction. That said, it is rather difficult to solve the problem when you don&rsquo;t realize that you are a substantial part of it. The reverse also holds true: If management is able to identify what it is doing wrong (or not enough of), then fixing the problem becomes less of a challenge, since  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Make-SHIFT-Five-Step-Success-Corporate-ebook/dp/B007AIQMK2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426260252&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=shift+beverly+flaxington\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   managers can control the factors  </a> </u>  that are causing it. In the words of Mahatma Gandhi, they need to be the change they want to see in others.</p><p> The following advice will help managers who have recognized the symptoms of dysfunctional teams in their own unit and are looking for ways to facilitate the team&rsquo;s recovery starting with themselves, as well as those who wish to make certain that their workplace environment remains healthy and productive as long as possible.</p><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t avoid conflict. </strong> When conflict takes place, employee priorities shift and people become more focused on their disagreements than on the work that needs to be done. Don&rsquo;t ignore the problem until it becomes an elephant in the room; get together with your team members and openly discuss what is working and what&rsquo;s not, and what can be done to clear the air. When problems occur, your best strategy is to acknowledge them, take necessary measures to address them, and move on. Lastly, don&rsquo;t think of conflict as a completely negative experience; disruptive as it may be, conflict (when handled well) can actually help your team&rsquo;s progress by obviating groupthink and stimulating their creative gene.</li><li> <strong>  Be clear on expectations for everyone. </strong> Vague sets of expectations will prevent your team members from achieving their full potential. Confusion is never a good thing for employee relationships and commitment, whereas clarity brings order and instills a sense of confidence and trust into people, taking drama out of the equation. Have regular check-in meetings to make sure that everyone understands their objective and steadily advances towards it.</li><li> <strong>  Set milestones and transparent accountabilities. </strong> They will help you benchmark your team&rsquo;s performance and keep track of individual progress. Absence of clear accountabilities promotes finger-pointing, and breeds jealousy and resentment among the employees, who might feel that not everyone on the team is pulling their weight.</li><li> <strong>  Avoid favoritism. </strong> No matter whether it&rsquo;s actual or perceived, unfair treatment is extremely off-putting. It damages employee morale, erodes positive team dynamics and destroys trust. If your team members have little respect for you, they will be reluctant to carry out the tasks and responsibilities you assign to them. Consequently, your communication will suffer. All these factors together help create the kind of hostile environment in which gossip and rumors thrive and employees make personal interests and gains their chief priority, thus destroying the team.</li><li> <strong>  Share the &ldquo;wins&rdquo; and give recognition. </strong> Celebrating even the smallest achievements of the team has a profound effect on the team&rsquo;s spirit and self-esteem. Employees who feel that management knows and values what they do for the company, put twice as much effort in their work. They are also more likely to encourage other team members to do their best and support them along the way.</li><li> <strong>  Recognize behavioral differences and leverage them. </strong> Sometimes the conflict arises because people communicate differently and have different approaches to problem-solving and work style. These differences cause a rift, when in actuality they can be leveraged by a good manager. It&rsquo;s good to have different viewpoints and different approaches in order to cover the bases. Learn about each team member and deploy them to their best strengths.</li><li> <strong>  Assign roles and responsibilities in the team. </strong> Have members &ldquo;own&rdquo; something. Who is the anointed leader? Who is the recorder? Who is the time-keeper? Give everyone a specific role within the team, in addition to their role on the project. Make them accountable TO the team.</li><li> <strong>  Set ground rules. </strong> Don&rsquo;t wait until there are problems to say what&rsquo;s okay and what&rsquo;s not okay. How will the team communicate? How often will they meet? What&rsquo;s the penalty for not completing an assigned task on time? What are the team priorities? Before they even begin to work together, have them establish their guidelines and agreements for working together and committing to one another.</li><li> <strong>  Give them some room to breathe. </strong> If you are one of those over-bearing managers who feel the need to follow their employees&rsquo; every step and call for a meeting every time someone sneezes the wrong way &ndash; you need to stop right now. What you are doing is actually counterproductive. Your employees are not a group of preschoolers who need constant supervision and routine lecturing. Most of them are well-qualified professionals who are actually quite good at what they do. Give them some space to learn to rely one another and build mutual dependence and trust. What is the proper amount of oversight and how much is too much? Truthfully, it is a delicate balancing act that depends on the type of people you work with and the task at hand, so you need to be able to adjust according to your particular set of circumstances. <br/>  </li><p> Chances are that you have honestly checked off every point in the list above and still your team doesn&rsquo;t quite &ldquo;click&rdquo;. In that case, you need to look at the issue from a different perspective, as oftentimes the elements that make your team dysfunctional lie within the team itself. We will discuss these factors and how managers can effectively deal with them in the second part of this blog, coming soon.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Last week the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released the minutes from its previous policy meeting. </strong> These minutes provide an inside look at the discussion that ultimately results in the decision whether or not to change the policy target, which has been stuck at zero percent since late 2008. Goldman Sachs economists noted that though the minutes contained &ldquo;few surprises,&rdquo; there were a handful of noteworthy changes. &ldquo;Several&rdquo; discussion participants supported raising the policy target in June, while &ldquo;others&rdquo; favored waiting until later in 2015.</p><p> <strong>  Committee members cited low inflation </strong> , dragged down by slumping energy prices and a stronger dollar, as a reason for waiting to raise interest rates. This is interesting because several participants stated, outside of the policy discussion, that oil and a strong dollar were &ldquo;transitory&rdquo; (see <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/25/us-usa-fed-evans-dollar-idUSKBN0ML19S20150325\" target=\"_blank\">  Evans </a> , Lacker, and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/23/us-usa-fed-fischer-idUSKBN0MJ1VP20150323\" target=\"_blank\">  Fischer </a> ). These participants noted weaker growth on lower consumer spending, residential investment and net exports, and also cited slow wage improvement. On balance, the minutes told the market little it did not already know. Goldman pointed out in a related research report that the FOMC meeting minutes from the past fifteen years tend to produce a two basis point impact on 10-year Treasury bond yields in the thirty minutes following the release, which is incorporated into bond prices &ldquo;virtually instantaneously&rdquo; (for comparison, the official FOMC statement has an impact of roughly double that, around four basis points).</p><p> The minutes confirm the widely held suspicion that the FOMC will raise interest rates sometime over the next twelve months, but that the timing remains uncertain. Despite the Fed&rsquo;s effort to project their intentions, some of the biggest bond money managers still see reason for additional market volatility. BlackRock last month wrote that the dip in market volatility in mid-2014 was &ldquo;nice while it lasted,&rdquo; but that the bumpy start to 2015 &ldquo;suggests a volatile year to come.&rdquo; PIMCO said the same thing, essentially: <strong>  &ldquo;We expect &lsquo;Yellenomics&rsquo; to lose its grip on market prices&hellip;leading to an increase in market volatility.&rdquo; </strong> We agree that there will be additional volatility, but for different reasons.</p><p> The market, in our view, has already priced in an interest rate increase. We remain cautious, however, because domestic fundamentals, specifically economic growth, job creation and inflation, the driving forces behind the rising rate argument, all appear to be flagging. That said, our portfolio durations are modestly overweight, both to reflect our cautious economic outlook and also to capture incremental daily accrued interest.</p>Sources: FRB, GS, Bloomberg, BlackRock, PIMCO, SNWAM Research<p>  </p>",

    "title": "Failing Sales People: Could It Be Fear?",
    "link": "failing-sales-people-could-it-be-fear",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Are Sales People Afraid? </h3><p> <br/> I know, it sounds a bit silly. Afraid of what?</p><p> Well, here is the thing. In my experience, many sales people are actually afraid of rejection. Why?</p><p> Because there is no business practice where you have to bring yourself in as much as when selling. Whether it's selling a product or a service, sales is emotional and personal. We professionals in sales live by how well we perform. That means our livelihood is in the balance every day, every call, every client interaction. Though not as common in a traditional sales environment, fear can also be felt in a consultative sales environment.</p><h3> So where does this fear originate?</h3><p> <br/> It starts with the cold calling/prospecting efforts that most sales people are terrified of. Hint to CEOs and sales managers - sales people who don't like cold calling will most likely try to avoid it at any cost.</p><p> It could be a mindset issue that is keeping you from breaking through to others. Although counter-intuitive, being afraid of success is something fairly common in the business world (or on a personal level). In a sales environment it's a lot more transparent and easier to detect. The effects are also a lot more drastic, because so many sales people depend on earning commission.</p><h3> Fear-less Cold-calling/Prospecting? Is there such a thing?</h3><p> <br/> There is various ways to deal with the fear of cold-calling issue.</p><p> You can hire an inside sales person or a lead generation team to take the cold calling off your sales people.</p><p> You can help your sales people overcome the reluctance of cold calling. Structuring the prospecting process with the right kind of research and providing training are two of a number of ways to reduce the fear of cold-calling.</p><p> But the fear usually doesn't stop after that. Sales people need to bring themselves in at every step of the sales process. Sales people are mostly measured by numbers. And if we don't put numbers on the books it puts enormous pressure on us.</p><h3> Not every sales person is good at everything</h3><p> <br/> There is always the option to outsource the lead generation process, or to develop an inside sales team. Many companies who have taken that path have seen sales soar as a result. The \"front-end\" of the sales process (filling the pipeline) is the one area that can be outsourced successfully with great results. Developing qualified opportunities is the toughest part of the sales process (I know, because I do it for my clients on a daily basis) and it makes sense to hire specialists.</p><h3> Afraid to Ask for a Sale?</h3><p> <br/> Not everybody is equipped to ask for money and that's essentially what we need to do in a sales environment. We are asking people to trust us to part with their or their company's funds. If our prospects end up buying from us and the product/service doesn't meet their needs, we will be held accountable for that decision. All of those areas are deeply emotional and directly connected to mindset. A good salesperson can be trained on how and when to ask for a sale that is not fear-inducing!</p><h3> Is Fear Rational Behavior?</h3><p> <br/> In the world of sales, fear is often irrational. Just as we are not afraid of flying because we don't like to be up in the air, we are afraid because we could die and we have no \"control\". Doesn't sound very rational when we put it in those terms, does it? Take the fear of public speaking - it is so intense that some people freeze up although there is no imminent danger lurking.</p><h3> Help Can Be Right There In Your Team!</h3><p> <br/> The most effective way to help sales people be more comfortable in a sales environment is to help them feel more confident. Confidence often stems from having been successful, so when companies establish an environment where sales people are nurtured and trained rather than pushed and reprimanded, success flows more freely.</p><p> Also, understand what your sales people are good at and where the weaknesses (or as we prefer to say: the opportunities) lie. That is essential when helping them. If you have a strong cold caller on your team, tap into that talent (trust me, it's rare) and share commission when revenue is closed.</p><p> When you have a strong \"closer\" on your team, bring him/her into final meetings to lend support. Very often we ask too much of sales people and the feeling over being overwhelmed results in panic, desperation and in the worst case scenario unprofessional behavior.</p><h3> What Are We Best At?</h3><p> <br/> So, in the end, always try to analyze why your sales people are not producing. Develop their strengths, and nurture their areas of opportunities through training and support. The investment you make can pay off manifold if you choose training that actually effects real behavioral change! And finally, just maybe, some sales people might not really be equipped to be in sales. You might detect that in the way they position your company offering, or in their attitude and/or work habits. You will definitely find out if revenue is lacking. You can also simply test their sales acumen. My company offers a Skills &amp; Knowledge Assessment that is not an exam or test, but rather a quick and thorough method to measure sales skills and knowledge. It serves as a vehicle for manager's to understand the performance gaps of their team members. This Sales IQ will help you gain insight on the strengths of your team members as compared to over 4,000 top sales performers, certified SuperSellersTM, from a cross-section of different industries.</p><p> Whatever changes you decide to make to increase your sales revenues, make sure you know your sales staff well. They are your first and foremost representation. We should all shine as sales people, and we should be supported to do just that. And that will result in a lot more \"fearless\" salespeople!</p>",

    "link": "get-your-financial-advicecold-pressed",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As recently discussed in the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-juice-20150131-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  LA Times </a> , the juicing trend continues to be strong in 2015, particularly in Southern California. Nowadays, many consumers are seeking out cold pressed options in lieu of the traditional centrifugal juicers.</p><p> Apparently, cold pressed juicers safely extract juice by slowly grinding and pressing fruits and vegetables, instead of shredding them with fast-spinning blades. The fast-spinning blades in a traditional juicer generate heat, which can destroy many of the nutrients and enzymes in your fruits and vegetables. Cold pressed juicers reduce the heat and create a more nutrient-filled snack.</p><p> Similar to the cold pressing juice aficionados, I&rsquo;m a firm believer that the way financial advice has been delivered for decades can be greatly improved upon. I believe there is a safer way to extract financial advice from the experts&mdash;a way that puts your interest ahead of theirs, at all times.</p><p> The traditional model that many financial advisors have adopted and still operate under today is called the suitability standard. Put simply, if these advisors, often known as &ldquo;brokers,&rdquo; can determine that a financial product is suitable for your investment profile, he or she can sell it to you. They are not obligated to consider costs, expenses, or even best interests of the client.</p><p> If that&rsquo;s not enough to cause some concern, these fast-spinning brokers are typically selling a product in return for a commission. Not only does this compensation model present a potential conflict of interest, but the client often pays more for advice than necessary. Needless to say, the characteristics of the suitability standard model can destroy the value often found in working with a financial professional.</p><p> <strong>  The fiduciary model, on the other hand, is a more appropriate way to render financial advice, in my opinion. </strong> A financial professional adhering to the fiduciary standard is required by law to put your interests ahead of theirs at all times.</p><p> Fiduciaries, often referred to as Registered Investment Advisors (RIA&rsquo;s), typically charge a flat, transparent fee in return for the advice they provide. This fee usually comes in the form of a percentage of assets, annual fee, monthly fee, or even an hourly fee. Regardless of how the fee is billed, the consumer is always informed of the amount and their interests are always put first. Costs, expenses, quality of product and more are taken into consideration before making any recommendations. </p><p> <strong>  Due to the stricter obligations of a fiduciary, the advice process is often longer than a commissioned broker. </strong> A fiduciary will take time to extract the unique characteristics of the client and prepare a plan that puts them in the best possible situation for success. In addition, RIA&rsquo;s will typically render advice on more than just investments. This might include tax planning, estate planning, charitable giving, college planning, and more.</p><p> Financial professionals have been rendering advice under the suitability standard for decades. Like traditional centrifugal juicers, it is a solution, but not the best one. If you want objective, conflict free financial advice, get it cold pressed and work with and work with an advisor who has adopted the fiduciary standard.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: By  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/blog.aspx?author=Ken%20Holiday\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ken Holiday  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ecova  </u> </a></p><p> We posted this blog below last May after a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/news-media/webinars/inside-energy-sustainability-webinars.aspx?id=fsv1dr4scff\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   webinar addressing the rising costs of water  </a> </u> . Given the recent restrictions on water in California, we wanted to dust it off as these best practices are still relevant to companies needing to understand and manage their water consumption.</p><h3> Water Rates Are Increasing</h3><p> <br/> Ecova manages over 2.5 billion data points in our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/solutions/ecova-technology/ecova-big-data-warehouse.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Big Data Warehouse  </a> </u>  that we use to analyze trends and determine key findings for our clients. Since 2008, we&rsquo;ve managed expenses for over 1 trillion gallons of water―that&rsquo;s a lot of water flowing through sinks, toilets and irrigation systems at facilities around the country! Over the last five years we&rsquo;ve seen, on average across the U.S., more than a 30 percent increase in water rates for our clients. Water costs are rising across all industries and building types from offices and retail to industrial facilities. Several states have seen 40 percent or more per unit cost increases since 2008, and the regional variation adds further complexity to the challenge. Add these increases to the fact that utility expenses are typically the third highest controllable expense (and water/sewer costs can be up to a third of total utilities), and there is reason to be concerned.</p><h3> Industry Drivers Increase Water Rates</h3><p> <br/> Aging infrastructure, droughts, and rising energy prices are putting upward pressure on water rates. Energy as a water cost driver may seem counter-intuitive; however, extracting, conveying, and pumping water into storage facilities requires power―not to mention wastewater treatment energy demand. Lastly, there are no alternate providers. Unlike being able to shop around for energy in deregulated markets, there is no such opportunity when it comes to water. Unit prices are, for the most part, uncontrollable.</p><p> <strong>  GET EXPENSE DATA IN ORDER </strong> <br/> Manage and analyze bills to gain insight into consumption at the site level. Use this analysis to identify and respond to billing errors and gain transparency and insights on spikes or high consumption locations, which could mean incorrect meter reads or water leaks.</p><p> <strong>  ENGAGE EMPLOYEES &amp; UNDERSTAND HOW WATER IS USED INTERNALLY </strong> <br/> Encourage employees to keep an eye out for leaks and to adapt behaviors to conserve water. Repairing water leaks in faucets and sinks can add up to real savings, along with water conservation practices.</p><p> <strong>  CHANGE INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOOK OUTSIDE THE BUILDING </strong> <br/> Controlling or modifying equipment can be a challenge given degradation due to age or improper use or installations, so look for opportunities to upgrade equipment to higher efficiency options. Investigate water efficiency low-cost and capital investments, as well as equipment specifications for new construction/remodel sites. The EPA&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/watersense/\" target=\"_blank\">   WaterSense  </a> </u>  program can help identify products (think ENERGY STAR&reg; for water). Lastly, don&rsquo;t forget to look outside the building at water consumption associated with irrigation. Are sprinklers watering parking lots instead of landscaping, or are they on when it&rsquo;s raining? There are opportunities to revise settings and/or install advanced and smart irrigation controls to avoid pouring money down the drain.</p><p> The business case is clear for investing in a water management program given the upward trending rates of water over the last five years and the likelihood high rates will continue. I encourage you to spend thirty minutes to watch the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/news-media/webinars/inside-energy-sustainability-webinars.aspx?id=fsv1dr4scff\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   water webinar  </a> </u>  to learn how to create a successful water management program.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Last week I saw a Dalai Lama quote on social media that at first made me laugh, but has stuck with me since.</p><h3> &ldquo;If you think you are too small to make a difference, you have never spent the night with a mosquito.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  One of my favorite places in the world </strong> is my wife&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s cabin, a more-than-rustic retreat nestled away in the forests of Northwest Montana with no plumbing but a single faucet of lake water, no phones, no TV, spotty cell service and peace.</p><p> When we&rsquo;re there, my family and I spend the day horsing around in the lake, hiking in the sun. When they&rsquo;re in season, I pick a bunch of huckleberries, slowly at first because they seem too hard to find, then like a madman when I realize they&rsquo;re all around me. We eat well, talk a lot and marvel at our good fortune.</p><p> Then, it&rsquo;s bedtime and the single mosquito that survived our most diligent attempts to prevent entry and the eventual, reluctant use of bug spray makes its presence known just as we&rsquo;re about to fall off to sleep&hellip; that maddening, high-pitched hum just next to your ear. You swat at it. You swat at it again. You&rsquo;re now wide-awake and the pleasant feeling you had moments earlier has completely evaporated.</p><p> <strong>  Life is now about a mosquito. Or rather, killing a mosquito. </strong></p><p> So what does this have to do with making a difference? I&rsquo;ll explain.</p><p> <strong>  I worked with an asset management firm recently that was struggling with growth. </strong> As they hired more and more people and hurried to keep pace, the culture that had been so easy to maintain when they were small began to deteriorate. Like a lot of smaller companies experiencing rapid expansion, the things people loved about the place were disappearing. As a result, employee retention had become an issue &ndash; further aggravating an already frustrating condition.</p><h3> Enter the Positive</h3><p>   <br/> . . . the mosquito (if you will) whose relentless optimism infected everyone in the organization. This particular individual was a new member to the legal team and part of management. One person whose positive perspective had a noticeable impact on the culture that was evident almost immediately.</p><p> <strong>  This individual was eminently competent. </strong> Her upbeat outlook was not the product of a na&iuml;ve world-view. She held herself to a high standard of performance and had the same expectation of her colleagues. What was powerful about her contribution was the respect she demonstrated in her dealings with everyone, an authentic, look-you-in-the-eye style that never varied, whether she was interacting with the CEO or an intern in the mailroom.</p><p> She understood as well as anyone how challenging work at a growing company could be.</p><h3> The Difference was Her Attitude.</h3><p> <br/> If we faced difficulties, she instilled confidence that we would overcome them together. As Wade Boggs once said, &ldquo;Our lives are not determined by what happens to us but how we react to what happens, not by what life brings us but the attitude we bring to life.&rdquo; Whatever the circumstances, she chose to react positively, and the affect on the culture was palpable.</p><p> <strong>  The significance of the mosquito analogy is this: Just as a mosquito demands your attention through its constant, unwavering insistence, a leader (or a follower) who seeks to make a difference in his or her world must also be constant. The power of positivity is lost if it&rsquo;s unpredictable. </strong></p><p> What is often referred to glibly as a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude is really a critical business asset. It&rsquo;s energizing. It attracts other positive, powerful people. It stimulates creativity. Nurturing a positive environment requires people who by their very nature see solutions, not problems. For some this comes naturally, but it&rsquo;s within reach for us all. The trick is to make positivity your default. As a business leader, if it&rsquo;s not your style to be relentlessly positive, you need to hire people who are.</p><p> You and I have a choice as employers, employees, colleagues, neighbors, clients and friends. With our words and actions, we can represent either the positive or the negative. If we&rsquo;re to learn anything from the mosquito (apart from desperate rage), it&rsquo;s that constancy and persistence are powerful forces. Just as the wind permanently shapes trees and water carves stone, the power of an individual&rsquo;s positive presence can make a real and lasting impact on her company.</p><p> <strong>  Like the mosquito, you can be the positive, supporting voice that can always be counted on to say &ldquo;we can, we will&rdquo;, because if you believe it, it&rsquo;s true. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> For most of my career, working inside of corporations, I was not co-located with my team.  At one point, my boss was in LA, I was in Virginia and the people I supervised were literally all around the country. During those years, I learned a lot about how to create high performing virtual teams. It stretched my skills beyond managing the work effort to finding new and creative ways to build relationships and create a web of strength among all of the team members.</p><p> This past year, I worked with a client who was unsure about his  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-request-no-promotion-please/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new leadership position  </a> </u>  where he would have a large virtual team.  He told me he loves leading people, developing strong relationships and doing great work together.  He also told me that he had no idea how to do that without sitting in the same office and was thinking about leaving his organization. Before he had a chance to hate his new job, I challenged him to break the frame and redefine his concept of team.  In the months to follow, he successfully reframed, stretched and grew his leadership skills into the virtual space. </p><p> Here are many of the ideas we covered to create a high performing virtual team.  If you&rsquo;ve ever led a team, co-located or dispersed, many of these concepts will feel familiar. </p><h3> Social Media is Great Training for Virtual Team Leadership</h3><p> <br/> In the social media age, it&rsquo;s easy to understand how you can feel very connected to people that you&rsquo;re conversing with 140 characters at a time.  They feel like friends and it feels like you know them, because you do, but only part of who they are.  When you&rsquo;re on the same team, the goal is to take that feeling of camaraderie deeper. </p><p> On social media, that means scheduling a time to talk or meet to get to know each other.  Works for high performing virtual teams too!   <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/can-half-of-a-person-be-a-whole-leader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Get to know your people as human beings </a> &hellip; not only workers in another state or country. </p><p> TIP: Get to know the people behind the profile picture. This is your team, you&rsquo;re in it together!</p><h3> Not All Communication Vehicles Are Created Equal</h3><p> <br/> We all know that you can email, IM, tweet or pick up the phone to connect with someone.  Hopefully, when you have a quick question, you&rsquo;re likely to make a different choice than when you&rsquo;re delivering performance feedback. Still, if all you do is IM or you tend to default to email&hellip; you&rsquo;re missing out. </p><p> Voice to voice is not a hardship!  In fact, now it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to meet eye to eye thanks to free technologies like G+ and Skype. </p><p> TIP: If you want to create high performing virtual teams, create opportunities to see each other.  Body language, eye contact and tone all matter.  It&rsquo;s hard to discern sarcasm in an IM&hellip;</p><h3> Suck It Up and Get on a Plane</h3><p> <br/> One in person meeting can skyrocket the effectiveness of a relationship.  Sometimes I would fly to them, sometimes they would come to me and annually we tried to get the entire team in a room. During the in person meetings, we not only made a lot of progress on the work, but also got to know each other as people and created shared memories. </p><p> TIP: If budget allows, not only get the team together for a working session, but also plan on some  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leaders-create-an-org-culture-of-shared-commitment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   shared experiences  </a> </u> &hellip; bowling, mini golf or dinner gives time for bonding.</p><h3> Be Creative with Your Team Building</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;d make a coffee run with your team member down the hall, you can schedule the same with your colleague in another office. Agree on a time, fill up your cup, and jump on a Hangout. Take 15 minutes just to check in on your day, take a deep breath and enjoy the java. </p><p> I&rsquo;ve been on virtual teams that had baby showers with games and prizes, book clubs and movie nights out (we bought tickets for everyone and we opened our next team meeting talking about the movie). Ask your team for suggestions and get support putting them into motion.</p><p> TIP:  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/why-be-creative/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   You&rsquo;re only limited by your creativity  </a> </u> . The important thing is injecting some play while creating opportunities to deepen relationships.</p><h3> Make Regularly Scheduled 1x1s a Priority</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of having 1x1s with all of your direct reports every two weeks.  Yes, you will likely meet in-between but the 1&times;1 is a time to keep the agenda focused on both work and career development. </p><p> When you&rsquo;re not co-located, it can be easy to let 1x1s slide.  Nobody is going to knock on your office door when you&rsquo;re busy to remind you of your scheduled time.  Especially in a virtual team environment, people don&rsquo;t see all of the things that take up your day and can truly feel out there on their own if 1x1s are constantly canceled. </p><p> TIP: When virtual, it&rsquo;s tempting to check in on email while on the phone and squeeze in a little multi-tasking. Don&rsquo;t do it.  Give the person on the phone 100% of your attention.</p><h3> Let People Lead</h3><p> <br/> You may feel that as the leader on a virtual team, you need to remind them who&rsquo;s in charge.  Hello &ndash; they know. If your voice is the only one on your conference calls, you have a problem.  Let others facilitate, lead the agenda, give important status updates on their work and lead team-wide programs.</p><p> TIP: Help your team members grow their leadership skills and expertise in facilitating a virtual team by giving them meaty initiatives to lead.  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/the-most-powerful-question-a-leader-can-ask/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Be there, just like you would in person  </a> </u> , to brainstorm, support and remove roadblocks. </p><h3> Create a Shared Virtual Workspace</h3><p> <br/> There are many collaboration technologies out there to make it easy to work on shared documents and track updates.  Whether it&rsquo;s a workplace with status updates or a presentation that needs charts from multiple team members, emailing back and forth is a thing of the past. </p><p> You may need to try out a few tools before you figure out what works for you and your team.  I have had success using both Google Docs and Basecamp. There are many good choices out there that will save you time and headaches from going through your email for old versions and latest updates.</p><p> TIP:  Once you decide to go with a technology,  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/what-commitment-look-like/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  really commit to making it work </a> .  It&rsquo;s easy to think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll email just this time&hellip;&rdquo; but it sets the tone for the entire team.</p><h3> Agree on Protocols and Etiquette</h3><p> <br/> On some teams, you accept all meeting invites and on others it&rsquo;s okay to decline, send a substitute, or ask for a meeting to be moved. Set the tone for how you will work as a team and don&rsquo;t leave people guessing. </p><p> It&rsquo;s also imperative to be respectful of time zones.  Don&rsquo;t always schedule meetings for 11 AM ET in the USA and expect your Australian team members to be jumping for joy.</p><p> TIP:  Make time to talk about the way you work and the way you want to work as a team. Create agreements, be explicit, be a role model for follow through.  </p><h3> What about Virtual Team Leadership If You&rsquo;re Not &ldquo;The Leader?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve read all the way to this point and are thinking, &ldquo;This is all great, but I&rsquo;m not the team leader, what can I do?&rdquo; Here are a few ideas:</p><p> <strong>  Make suggestions </strong> <br/> If you see opportunities for improvement, speak up!  Schedule a call or hangout to share your ideas on how to improve the work and team culture too.  Team-wide conference calls may not the right time.</p><p> <strong>  Raise your hand </strong> <br/> Step up to lead while creating opportunities to deepen your relationships with your colleagues too.  You can&rsquo;t swing by your boss&rsquo;s office but you can pick up the phone.</p><p> <strong>  Be Human </strong> <br/> Don&rsquo;t worry about always being formal.  Take a deep breath show people who you are.  They can&rsquo;t see your silly socks&hellip; so tell them and send a pic too!</p><p> <strong>  Reach out </strong> <br/> Touch base with your colleagues and be a connector.   <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/instigate-joy-at-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Initiate moments of connection  </a> </u> .  </p><p> Some of my fondest moments from my career took place on virtual teams and those connections remain strong today, many years later. </p><p> I have a list of free and low cost team building ideas for virtual teams.  If you&rsquo;re interested, shoot me an email and I&rsquo;m happy to share.</p><p> Have you been on or led a virtual team?  What would you add?</p> ",

    "link": "banks-without-a-digital-core-will-fail",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "Building on the discussion of <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/04/data-personalisation-strikes-to-the-heart-of-the-bank-disruption.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  data being key to disruption </u> ,</a> I often use the phrase &lsquo;digital core&rsquo; in this context.  Therefore, I was intrigued when someone asked for a definition of a &lsquo;digital core&rsquo; and one of the replies was there isn&rsquo;t a core anymore.I wondered what they meant and, in explanation, they referred to the idea of a central point of systems &ndash; a mainframe &ndash; is no longer the way the markets operate.  Systems should instead be spread across server farms in the cloud so there is no single point of failure.  I totally agree, and therefore felt it worth a little more explanation of digital core as so many misinterpret what this means.<strong> First, I have defined my terms several times before:</strong><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/01/ghgh.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What is &lsquo;fintech&rsquo;?  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/12/what-is-a-digital-bank.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What is a &lsquo;digital bank&rsquo;  </a>  ? </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/11/what-is-the-digital-core-for-a-bank.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What is the &lsquo;digital core&rsquo;?  </a> </u></li>But it does no harm to reiterate some points, such as this one.So a digital core is, in essence, the removal of all bank data into a single structured system in the cloud.  The data is cleansed, integrated and provides a single, consistent view of the customer as a result.That&rsquo;s a big ask, and most banks tell me it&rsquo;s not achievable.  Silo structures and line of business empires protect data sharing and lock client information in their product focused empires; creating a single, cleansed store of cloud-based data is too insecure, creating the opportunity for any cyberattacker to bring down the bank; a single data store would not be good for risk management purposes; etc, etc.<h3> I understand all these concerns, but don&rsquo;t agree with them.</h3>The product-focused empires are the problem.  You cannot have customer-centric operations if your organisation is product aligned.Cyberattackers also find it far easier to steal from fragmented systems than one that can track digital entries in real-time across the enterprise.Equally, banks are pretty darn poor at risk management in their fragmented, product-focused structures, as evidenced by two meetings with my bank recently.  The first meeting is with my business relationship manager, who tells me all the ins and outs of the banks&rsquo; SME operations.  I then, for the first time in living memory, allowed my new personal relationship manager to visit.  He had printed and read very carefully all my information and wanted to complete an up-to-date fact find for KYC and sales purposes.  That was fine.Halfway through the conversation he asks: &ldquo;what do you do for a living?&rdquo;  I said that I thought he would know as I talk to my relationship manager often.  &ldquo;Oh&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t show on our records.  Who did you talk to?&rdquo;  I explained that it was Paul, my SME manager, as I have my business account with the bank.  &ldquo;Oh&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that&rdquo;.This is fairly typical of all banks I talk to &ndash; their corporate, commercial and retail bank systems are separated and never the twain meet &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not the way a digital bank would work.<strong> A digital bank with a digital core would immediately create the inter-relationship profiles of the digital footprints of all individuals who touch the bank.</strong>  That is the way you can drive contextual relationships and offers to those who touch the bank.  It is also the only way you can drive a consistent, augmented and informed approach to clients who touch the bank.Equally, a digital bank has a single digital core of data in the cloud that can then be accessed by any form. <strong> The digital core is independent of the processors, and hence you can take out a server or a system at any point and replace it with a new processor, because you have no reliance on the engines.  Your reliance is on the data being clean and consistent.</strong>For me, it is a critical factor in developing the digital bank and yet whenever I get into a conversation about this with a bank, I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s too difficult.<strong> It may be too difficult but I suspect that if banks don&rsquo;t bite this bullet, the fintech specialists who do get the data structures right will eat their lunch.</strong>",

    "content": "<h3> Our mantra that &ldquo;inclusion is a business imperative&rdquo; is an important one.</h3><p> <br/> Many times the argument is made that being inclusive of others is simply the right thing to do if you're a moral human being. In terms of business, though, the appeal to morals and values isn't always an effective one. Because most businesses need to make a profit, efforts to build diversity and inclusion need to address one fundamental question: how can diversity and inclusion increase my company's bottom line?</p><p> <strong>  The answer is that your employees will be more likely to work hard for your company if you value them for who they are </strong> , regardless of their gender, race, religion and/or sexual orientation. Hard work and a great work ethic can be found in any employee, regardless of their differences. Beyond loyal commitment from employees whose views are sought and considered, with a wide range of varied ideas being brought forward, your company is also likely to benefit from new product and service ideas, innovation and breakthrough thinking. There&rsquo;s no more direct impact on the bottom line!</p><p> In Dorie Clark's Forbesarticle  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorieclark/2014/08/21/making-the-business-case-for-diversity/\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Making the Business Case for Diversity  </u>  ,&rdquo; </a>  she introduces us to a remarkable man named <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toddsears\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Todd Sears  </u> </a> , the founder of <u>  Out on the Street </u> , a private consulting organization. His organization is dedicated to increasing business and leadership opportunities for those who are part of the LGBT community.</p><p> Because he dealt with a homophobic boss early in his career, Sears understands that inclusive companies are crucial for minorities in finding professional success. As for that one question, Sears knows he needs to answer it in order to get businesses to become members of this organization; they need to know how diversity will help their business thrive.</p><p> &ldquo;'...[C]orporations are for-profit entities, and they&rsquo;ll only do the &lsquo;right thing to do&rsquo; when they&rsquo;re flush with cash,'&rdquo; says Sears. &ldquo;'But they&rsquo;ll [always] do the right thing&hellip;if it&rsquo;s core to their business. So if you make LGBT inclusion, or inclusion of women or people of color, core to something that&rsquo;s business-relevant, then they&rsquo;ll always do it.'&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  In other words, the argument that including diversity &ldquo;is the right thing to do&rdquo; isn't enough. </strong> Although businesses should care about social justice and including others, attaching a business incentive to diversity will make the need for inclusion stick with them much more strongly than the &ldquo;it's the right thing to do&rdquo; ideology.</p><h3> The business incentive for being inclusive of diversity is simple:</h3><p> <br/> if you're an inclusive leader and show your employees that you value them for who they are (and embrace their diverse backgrounds!), they're going to want to work for you. They will feel comfortable suggesting ideas for new products and services that could set your company apart from competitors. Being inclusive of others will inevitably lead to a healthier, more positive work environment and culture. If your employees feel safe coming to work, they will be able to perform the tasks you ask them to do.</p><p> The business case for diversity is this-- being inclusive of diversity is simply good for growing your business and good for doing business.</p><p> <strong>  Be inclusive! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> To say something both well and succinctly takes practice and skill. Your readers have a slue of information at their fingertips and will quickly move on to the next article if you don&rsquo;t get to the point and deliver copy that&rsquo;s worth reading. <br/> <br/> In 1982, David Ogilvy, widely known as &ldquo;The Father of Advertising&rdquo; wrote an internal memo to his employees stating:</p><p> &ldquo;Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to  <u>  write </u>  well.&rdquo;</p><p> Here are my favorite simple tips to writing better copy:</p><h3> 1. Write in a strong voice</h3><p> <br/> Choose strong, action verbs, eliminate unnecessary adverbs, and avoid the passive voice.</p><p> You could say, &ldquo;The cars were flattened into pieces when the Hulk threw them roughly on the ground,&rdquo; but instead writers  <u>  Stan Lee </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://kirbymuseum.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jack Kirby  </a> </u>  would simply write, &ldquo;Hulk smash!&rdquo;</p><p> Two words tell that story better than 15. Make your point with a punch and your readers will come back for more.</p><h3> 2. Say just enough to make your point</h3><p> <br/> The active voice strengthens your sentences and eliminates unnecessary words. &ldquo;The house was painted by Bob&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Bob painted the house.&rdquo;</p><p> See? Shorter.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t waste your readers&rsquo; time with wordy, long-winded articles. Remove the unnecessary and the remaining bits will shine.</p><h3> 3. Write the way you talk</h3><p> <br/> Your  <u>  content </u>  should tell a story and flow naturally.</p><p> After writing your copy, read your piece out loud and ask yourself &ndash; is this really how I would say this in conversation?</p><p> Forcing yourself to enunciate every syllable and verb will not only help you identify the unnecessary, you&rsquo;ll also trip over the awkward.</p><h3> 4. Take your time</h3><p> <br/> Time gives a writer perspective. Mr. Ogilvy advises that you  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/06/david-ogilvy-10-tips-on-writing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   never send a letter or memo the day you write it  </a> </u> .</p><p> That extra time between writing and editing gives you the distance you&rsquo;ll need to chop and slice your copy and let go of the emotions attached to a particular sentence or phrase.</p><p> When you leave something and come back to it, if it still sounds good, you likely wrote it well.</p><h3> 5. Ask for help</h3><p> <br/> A second set of eyes often provides clarity and perspective you might otherwise miss. Not sure if you&rsquo;ve made your point or if an idea is important? Ask a colleague to take a look.</p><h3> What are your favorite tips to writing better copy?</h3>",

    "content": "<h3> At the beginning of the year, I decided to sign-up for a business book club.</h3><p> <br/> I used to read business books all the time, but in eliminating my former commute by moving steps away from my office, and becoming a mom with a full-time business, reading time got squeezed out of my day. I&rsquo;ve always been a big believer in continual learning though, so I was determined to get back into the habit. A book club meant a group to be accountable to, and a good resource for recommendations.</p><p> Fortunately, the pace isn&rsquo;t too crazy. We cover one book per quarter, and meet once per month either in person or virtually (members of the book club are spread out across the country). As you might imagine&mdash;this being a business book club&mdash;the meetings are either bright n&rsquo; early, or in a conference room with BYOL (bring your own lunch). No wine and cheese here.</p><p> <strong>  We recently wrapped up  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429548058&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+One+Thing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    The ONE Thing   </u>  </a>  by Gary Keller with Jay Papasan. </strong> The book was initially published in 2013, so it&rsquo;s entirely possible you may have already read it. To that I say: it is also a keeper for re-reading. And if you haven&rsquo;t read it yet, you&rsquo;ll want to add it to your &ldquo;to read&rdquo; list, even though I felt a bit prickly when I first started reading it. Why? Because it forces you to take a good look at how you&rsquo;re really spending your time. It calls into question the value of ye olde to-do list, and states plain and simple: multi-tasking doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p> Once I got past the first section though (titled &ldquo;The Lies: They Mislead and Derail Us&rdquo;) and had accepted some of the errors of the typical ways, I started to really &ldquo;get&rdquo; the book, especially once I gained an understanding of the &ldquo;Focusing Question&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?&rdquo; The question may seem a bit unwieldy at first, but when you really start thinking about it, you can&rsquo;t help but focus on what you should truly be doing at any given moment. Keller further breaks down the question into three parts, and then also frames the question as a &ldquo;Big-Picture Question: What&rsquo;s my ONE Thing?&rdquo; and also as a &ldquo;Small-Focus Question: What&rsquo;s my ONE Thing right now?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The Focusing Question kicks of Part 2 </strong> of the book that centers on productivity, including habit building and benchmarking. <strong>  Part 3, &ldquo;Extraordinary Results&rdquo; </strong> helps the reader put it all into action, including the concept of time blocking&mdash;one of my favorite strategies for making progress on my ONE Thing.</p><p> Each chapter summarizes the key action items with &ldquo;Big Ideas&rdquo; and the book comes pre-underlined, as if you&rsquo;ve got someone else&rsquo;s copy and they did the highlighting for you (although I still covered mine in my own yellow highlighter, and my kiddo added in a few drawings of her own).</p><p> <strong>  A whole program has grown out of the book </strong> , including training, workshops, podcasts, helpful worksheets, and live events. Check it out <a href=\"http://www.the1thing.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> . And if you happen to get a physical copy of the book, be sure to remove the book jacket for a little &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment.</p><p>  </p>",

Flaxington</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Identify your niche and dominate it. And when I say dominate, I just mean work harder than anyone else could possibly work at it&rdquo;, Nate Parker. </strong> This quote sums up the essence of having a niche focus for financial advisors. If you know your market, and you stick to your focused market and you talk to them, learn about them and serve their needs, you will be the first one associated with serving the market.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;niche&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> Doesn&rsquo;t a niche limit you and confine you? These are the questions we often hear from financial advisors. Planning and investing well is something that everyone needs, and the more money you have, the more you probably need it. So why pick a niche? Why not scan the market for everyone with $1 or 5 million and more?</p><p> When marketing and sales efforts are targeted to a specific and select group of people, the language, the stories and the descriptions are all relevant to that audience. The people hearing the message recognize themselves in the messaging. It allows them to say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me! And I do need that service.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Niche marketing can be as narrow or as broad as you like. </strong> It can be limited to an overall demographic like divorced women, or it can be specific such as dentists in private practice with more than 10 years to retirement. You define the niche that you believe is best served by what you do.</p><p> Next you learn everything you can about your niche. Learn the language they use, the things they need and care about and how they buy the type of products and services you offer. Adult learners want context. They want to understand how something new is relevant to them, and to their lives. The more you know about the niche market you are working in, the more you can target your comments and marketing message to them. The more they recognize themselves in what you do, the more willing they will be to listen to your story. If your story speaks to them, the more likely they will be to work with you.</p><p> <strong>  To find your niche, identify your ideal client profile and discover the attributes associated with them. </strong> Remember you can be as broad, or as narrow, as you like.</p><p> As a first step, consider whether you want to do niche marketing. If you do, review your targeted niche and make sure your materials and messaging are in alignment with that market. Begin to talk to the market in their language and see if you can&rsquo;t cement the niche for your advisory practice.</p>",

    "content": "<p>One of the greatest challenges for professionals working with complex ideas and products is to keep conversations and explanations as simple as possible &ndash; without being patronising. Nearly all clients are time-poor to a degree, and nearly all clients have more than enough complicated things happening in their lives that they begin to feel overwhelmed when we introduce more information which is difficult to work through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was reminded of this last week when an adviser admitted he was having a challenge with many clients understanding what his risk management recommendations really covered. After asking him to explain a typical recommendation to me in the same way that he does with clients I understood immediately why he was finding it a struggle. I&rsquo;ve been working in this field for 25 years and I was struggling to understand his explanation&hellip;.what chance that your typical consumer could?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the detailed explanations about elements of cover and how claims payments might be calculated have their place, but only after the core concept is understood and accepted as being reasonable. To be blunt, you have to get &ldquo;buy in&rdquo; from the customer to the idea that what you are recommending is reasonable before they are even slightly interested in the detail of it all. <strong> The question being asked up front is simply: &ldquo;Deal, or No Deal?&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this is how I explained &ldquo;the deal&rdquo;&hellip;.it is a set of promises. You, the client promise to pay a premium, and in return the insurance company promises to do these things:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/a-contract.jpg?w=747&amp;h=500\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It&rsquo;s just a contract.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People understand what contracts are: 2 parties who commit to do their side of the deal. Clients are usually perfectly capable and comfortable deciding on whether a contract is a good deal for them or not. <strong> Is it a good deal? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once they&rsquo;ve decided that it looks like it could be a good deal, THEN the detail matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of it as trying to explain to a client all the necessary detail of a commercial property that you think would be good for them&hellip;.the building plans, the security systems, the ergonomic design features, the status of the warrant of fitness on the elevators and code of compliance issues&hellip;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too much detail when they haven&rsquo;t even necessarily bought into the concept of whether the commercial property might be a good deal for them. They have to decide in the first instance that it is potentially a good deal before they are interested in the substantiating detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, to be truly blunt about it: are you bringing a good deal to the table or just wasting their time with meaningless nonsense?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the detail and the technical supporting information is meaningless nonsense until the client has bought into the idea that this just might be a good deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the front end we really do have to keep it simple, and it is as simple as &ldquo;Deal, or No Deal?&rdquo;. Only then does the logic and the detail matter.</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not having fun you&rsquo;re not doing it right&rdquo; is a line I have used for many years. If I&rsquo;m working at a project or spending time with my family and I start to get uptight or stressed out, I say to myself &ldquo;Ben, you&rsquo;re not having fun any more. You&rsquo;re not doing this right.&rdquo; It forces me back to living in the present.</p><p> Forget about how happy you&rsquo;ll be after you have gone through this crisis, or after you have reached some goal&mdash;perhaps paid off the mortgage or accumulated a retirement nest-egg. You may not live another week, let alone another year. Learn to put some humor into everything that you do and especially into everything that happens to you.</p><h3> Lighten Up</h3><p> <br/> There are many situations in which a little humor can help us to calm down and allow us to make a rational judgment. Jerry Lee Lewis says the best wedding gift he received was a videotape of the entire ceremony. When things would get rough in the early days of that marriage, he would go into a room by himself, play the tape backwards, and walk out a free man.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t like some of the signs of aging that are showing up, or some physical feature God has blessed you with that you wish He had not, make a joke about it. Have fun with it.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve lost almost all the hair off the top of my head and it is as shiny as a billiard ball. I don&rsquo;t mind. I tell people for Halloween I put on a turtleneck sweater, roll it up over my ears, cover my scalp with baby oil, and go around as a roll-on deodorant. Relax and have fun; you don&rsquo;t know how much time you have left. You don&rsquo;t lose much hair after you&rsquo;re dead.</p><p> Have fun with whatever is happening to you. Learning to laugh at yourself is really important. You will then stop taking yourself so seriously and start having a little laughter in your life. What an excellent and easy way to control your reaction to the stress you face every day.</p><p> &ldquo;There are three things which are real: God, human folly, and laughter. The first two are beyond our comprehension. So we must do what we can with the third.&rdquo;   &ndash; John F. Kennedy</p><p> Take your job seriously&hellip;and take yourself lightly. You can be serious without being solemn. In a recent survey of 737 CEOs, 98% said they would much rather hire somebody with a good sense of humor than somebody without one. In the words of Don Seibert, former CEO and Chairman of the JC Penney Company:</p><p> The most senior people and virtually all of the chief executive officers with whom I&rsquo;m personally acquainted have highly developed senses of humor. Humor is a common thread I&rsquo;ve seen in thousands of meetings in different companies on the most serious of subjects. Humor helps you keep your head clear when you&rsquo;re dealing with the most highly technical information or difficult decisions where choices are not that clear.</p><h3> Humor Jest for Health&rsquo;s Sake</h3><p> <br/> Without your health, you&rsquo;re dead. Humor not only keeps you living longer but lets you have a lot more fun while you&rsquo;re at it. According to William Fry Jr., M.D., who has done research on the physiology of laughter for 45 years, laughter is like &ldquo;internal jogging.&rdquo; He says laughter enhances respiration and circulation, oxygenates the blood, suppresses the stress-related hormones in the brain, and activates the immune system. It is also a powerful antidote for stress. Laughter is indeed the best medicine!</p><h3> Six Steps to Better Mental and Emotional Health: <br/>  </h3><li> Accept the fact that you alone control your attitude. Determine to take control of yours today.</li><li> Evaluate everything you feed your mind; every book, movie, TV program, and video. Before reading or viewing it ask the question, &ldquo;Is this going to help me in my personal, family, and business life?&rdquo;</li><li> Expand your vocabulary. Learn one new word per day.</li><li> Read something every day that will inspire, motivate and educate you.</li><li> Listen to teaching and motivational podcasts while you drive or exercise.</li><li> Select your inner circle with care. The people you associate with determine the type of person you are becoming.</li><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Sometimes people will just believe what they want to believe. And, what they believe is correct to them. So, is it possible for us to look at this as an opportunity in business? Personally, I think it is a huge opportunity! <br/> <br/> <strong>  Think about what people say and how their beliefs or pre-conceived notions supersede everything else.

    "content": "<p> To every one of us, the future is important. Maybe it&rsquo;s because the future is where we are going to spend the rest of our lives. Or could it be something more, something about the human spirit that has us looking ahead to a better future for ourselves, our families, and every living thing on the planet. One thing is for sure; you won&rsquo;t get to a better future without foresight.</p><p> Great leaders envision a better place for every stakeholder, and that includes employees, customers, and shareholders. When leadership foresight is compelling, inclusive, and easily definable, people want to be a part of it; they want to follow their leader to that place. &ldquo;Easily definable&rdquo; is the element within visions that facilitates the ethic of simplicity, and doing less, better in this complex world of business.</p><h3> &ldquo;Great leaders envision a better place for every stakeholder&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Clear visions work for inventors, athletes, sports teams, nations, and companies of all sizes and shapes. Star Trek creator,  <u>  Gene Roddenberry </u>  said, &ldquo;We must remember that the promise of tomorrow will not be fulfilled easily. The collective commitment of our nations, as well as the vision, wisdom, and hard work of many, many individuals will be required to bring our dreams to fruition. In a way, the Enterprise and the optimistic future in which it exists might be thought of as a reminder of what we can achieve if we try.&rdquo;</p><h3> Visionaries of the Information Age</h3><p> <br/> The information age has spurred the rise of young entrepreneurs seeking seed money and angel investors for their business ideas. In the old economy, slick merchant bankers and private equity executives sat in wooded oak or mahogany boardrooms listening to slick presentations by blue-suited forty year olds. Today&rsquo;s startup wannabes are twenty year olds in faded blue jeans carrying rucksacks of ideas, visions and dreams. You know who they are. Some became renowned billionaire luminaries; many are millionaires. Thousands continue to try, and try again they will. The nutrition that feeds their entrepreneurial lust is vision.</p><p> The choice facing every corporate leader is whether to lead change, or scramble to catch up to it. A clear and simple vision from a leader&rsquo;s foresight is the vital starting point, but that doesn&rsquo;t always guarantee changes in behavior. Nodding to the premise is easy. Travelling back and forth the nine inches between the head and the heart is the tough part. Leadership is the conduit. By converting ambivalent feelings and snuffing out procrastination, leaders can help their followers accept change, emotionally and rationally.</p><h3> World-Changing Foresight</h3><p> <br/> One can say that the future of the world has never been so bleak. But, never before have so many given of themselves to challenge the issues threatening mankind. From concerned global warming scientists to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   doctors without borders  </a> </u> , these leaders are dedicated to a better future. There is no place for procrastination in their foresight.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">   Elon Musk  </a> </u>  is the quintessential business visionary. Musk is the trailblazer behind the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tesla  </a> </u>  electric car. His foresight doesn&rsquo;t end there. He envisions commercial and affordable  <a href=\"http://www.space.com/26063-spacex-unveils-dragon-v2-manned-spaceship.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  space taxis </a>  (his company has already built one). In 2013, Musk unveiled an idea to revolutionize rapid transit, to create a submarine car, and a hyper speed jet. The grass is not growing under this leader&rsquo;s feet.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We recently had the opportunity to sit down with industry veteran Kelli Cruz to talk about her firm, Advisors and her beloved #SFGiants.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve been in the Bay Area your whole life? </strong></p><p> Yes, I am a California Girl through and through.  I grew up in Moraga, home of the St. Mary&rsquo;s Gaels, and went to college in San Francisco, and I really haven&rsquo;t ventured too far and why would I?  I travel a lot with my consulting work and I have to say every time the plane is making its descent back into the Bay Area I just marvel at the absolute beauty of the area.  I am a trail runner and I am constantly finding a new trail that just takes my breath away.  My mantra is &ldquo;so many trails and so little time to run them all&rdquo;.  The only time I ever seriously contemplated moving away was when I was dating my husband Tom who at the time was living in Minneapolis.  Fortunately it didn&rsquo;t take much convincing to get him to move to California.  It would be hard to leave the Bay Area not to mention according to Brooke Southhall and Tim Welsh the SF Bay Area is the West Coast hub of the RIA Industry.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve worked for two titans in the area&mdash;Schwab and Wells Fargo. How were they alike and how did they differ? </strong></p><p> I have worked for some great Bay Area based corporations starting with Bank of America, the Clorox Company, Wells Fargo and the last was with Charles Schwab.  I tried working in manufacturing at Clorox but after only a couple of years I found myself being pulled back into financial services.  The focus in manufacturing is on the product, the plant facility, safety, etc., very little focus on the people.  Financial services is a relationship based business without people you don&rsquo;t have a product.  Since my calling is human capital (the motivation and engagement of employees), I need to work in an industry where people are the biggest asset which is why financial services has been such a great match for me.     </p><p> There are some pretty big differences between Wells Fargo and Schwab.  First and foremost Wells Fargo is a bank and Schwab a brokerage firm, and this creates huge differences in the cultures. Since compliance and regulations rule banking the decision making process is slow and the overall attitude of the company is very conservative.   Every conceivable angle has to be examined and dissected before getting the green light on new projects and products.  A lot of time is spent on the internal process, getting people to agree with your ideas and as a result there is a lot of bureaucracy to navigate.  The positive side to the culture is that products and service are well conceived and once they hit the market they are ready to go.   Schwab is very consensus oriented too and way too much time is spent on the internal process there as well, but the main difference at least when I worked at Schwab Advisor Services is that no matter what the role everyone was focused on the end client, the advisor.  It was a great culture everyone was engaged and focused on solving problems for the advisors.  Programs were incubated and delivered to market in an incredibly short period of time.  It was a very dynamic and rewarding environment for over achievers like me.</p><p> <strong>  What does Cruz Consulting do and how do you help Advisors? </strong></p><p> CCG ensures that the most important area of their business&mdash;managing people&mdash;is made easier.  We do this with customized project-based &lsquo;Human Capital&rsquo; consulting engagements that include strategies, plans, processes, and implementation in the areas of: talent acquisition, compensation design, goals setting &amp; performance management, and succession planning.  For over two decades, our team has been a leading source of market intelligence and industry best practices for advisory firms and industry partners.</p><p> Our promise: to give firms the structure, processes, and the confidence they need to manage and optimize their people, so that they can serve clients better, grow their firm, and be more profitable.</p><p> <strong>  How it is out here as a small business owner? </strong></p><p> I thoroughly enjoy owning my own business and we are so lucky to work with some of the best firms in the industry.  I have a great partner, Jennifer Specter, we have worked together since 2006 and make a great team.  Although I am not an advisor, I have a deep respect for the services they provide and completely believe in the independent advice model.  If I were going to reinvent myself (which may happen) I would definitely be a financial advisor.  Without financial freedom we are so limited in what we can do in life.  I believe the independent advice model and financial planning give people the freedom to pursue what they want to do in their life and how they do it.  I feel very fortunate to work with independent advisors and this industry.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve also been very involved and close to studies on the industry from a data perspective&mdash;what are three things Advisors  have to pay most attention to. </strong></p><p> I think the most important take away from industry studies over the years and that which differentiates the top-performing firms from all the others, is the commitment to investing back into the firm and creating a real business.  Top-performing firms are better managers, both financially and opera&shy;tionally.  We find they have a disciplined approach to strategic planning that includes investing in technology that allows them to innovate and evolve their client service delivery as well as a human capital plan that can succeed beyond the first generation of owners.  Key investments in technology, human capital and having an internal succession plan are critical components.  Too many firms do not have a strategy for developing both the next generation of clients and the generation of talent on their team.  To me these two go hand in hand and we work with firms to help them develop human capital programs that develop the next generation of owners.</p><p> <strong>  Did you make it to the Giants season opener? </strong></p><p> As you know I am a big sports fan.  I get my love for sports from my Mom.  I grew up routing for all the Bay Area teams.  I am so thankful that my Mom got to see the SF Giants win three World Series before she passed away.  I did make it to the season opener and although we didn&rsquo;t win, the raising of the pennant flag and pregame ceremony was an amazing experience and made me proud.  Our skipper Bruce Bochy has created a culture that is all about the team.  They treat each other like family.  The players really care about each other and play selflessly, it is all about the team effort not the individual performance.  If one player gets hurt another steps up and fills in to help the team win.  I believe a lot can be learned from how Bruce Bochy manages.  He is the best at platooning or filling in with substitutes.  He always has a contingency plan for getting the job done.  The Giants organization is always scouting for talent and developing the next great player.  They are notorious for giving rookies a chance to step up and play.  I think advisors should take a page from his playbook and start investing in and developing a &ldquo;farm team&rdquo;.  Develop young talent that can step-in and contribute in a big way to the team effort. </p><p> <strong>  Prediction for this year? A fourth Series win in 6 years without Panda? </strong></p><p> Although it is an odd year and the Giants have only won the World Series in even years (2010, 2012, 2014) never and I mean NEVER count the SF Giants out of the race.  If we can make it to the post season we are unbeatable.  Just ask the Pirates, Nationals, Cardinals and Royals.   </p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the greatest challenges for professionals working with complex ideas and products is to keep conversations and explanations as simple as possible &ndash; without being patronising.  Nearly all clients are time-poor to a degree, and nearly all clients have more than enough complicated things happening in their lives that they begin to feel overwhelmed when we introduce more information which is difficult to work through.</p><p> <strong>  I was reminded of this last week when an adviser admitted he was having a challenge with many clients understanding what his risk management recommendations really covered. </strong>  After asking him to explain a typical recommendation to me in the same way that he does with clients I understood immediately why he was finding it a struggle.  I&rsquo;ve been working in this field for 25 years and I was struggling to understand his explanation&hellip;.what chance that your typical consumer could?</p><p> All the detailed explanations about elements of cover and how claims payments might be calculated have their place, but only after the core concept is understood and accepted as being reasonable.  To be blunt, you have to get &ldquo;buy in&rdquo; from the customer to the idea that what you are recommending is reasonable before they are even slightly interested in the detail of it all.  </p><h3> The question being asked up front is simply: &ldquo;Deal, or No Deal?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> So this is how I explained &ldquo;the deal&rdquo;&hellip;.it is a set of promises.  You, the client promise to pay a premium, and in return the insurance company promises to do these things:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/a-contract.jpg\" width=\"702\"/></p><h3> It&rsquo;s just a contract.</h3><p> <br/> People understand what contracts are: 2 parties who commit to do their side of the deal.  Clients are usually perfectly capable and comfortable deciding on whether a contract is a good deal for them or not.  Is it a good deal?</p><p> Once they&rsquo;ve decided that it looks like it could be a good deal, THEN the detail matters.</p><p> Think of it as trying to explain to a client all the necessary detail of a commercial property that you think would be good for them&hellip;.the building plans, the security systems, the ergonomic design features, the status of the warrant of fitness on the elevators and code of compliance issues&hellip;&hellip;</p><p> Too much detail when they haven&rsquo;t even necessarily bought into the concept of whether the commercial property might be a good deal for them.  They have to decide in the first instance that it is potentially a good deal before they are interested in the substantiating detail. </p><p> Or, to be truly blunt about it: are you bringing a good deal to the table or just wasting their time with meaningless nonsense?</p><p> All the detail and the technical supporting information is meaningless nonsense until the client has bought into the idea that this just might be a good deal.</p><p> At the front end we really do have to keep it simple, and it is as simple as &ldquo;Deal, or No Deal?&rdquo;.   <strong>  Only then does the logic and the detail matter. </strong></p>",

    "link": "rias-financial-literacy-should-be-a-calling-not-a-marketing-gimmick",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  April is Financial Literacy Month, timed around Tax Day when Americans are focused on money matters. </strong> With nearly three of every four adults acknowledging they would benefit from professional financial advice, <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/financial-literacy-month-should-be-calling-for-rias-not-a-marketing-gimmick/#_edn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [i] </a>  firms are wise to draw attention to their services this month. Over the years, we've worked with more than 150 different advisory firms and more than a few sought to leverage Financial Literacy Month in their media relations and blogging efforts.</p><h3> RIA&rsquo;s are uniquely well positioned to address financial literacy.</h3><p> <br/> And yet, advisors have not been especially successful connecting with people in mid-career or younger. This group comprises the demographic core of future investors, and they need counsel now if they are ever to achieve their financial goals. They display much lower financial literacy than older individuals &mdash; and the nation already posts a failing grade average of 62.5% on the National Financial Literacy Test. But what grade do advisors receive for relating to this audience and earning their business?</p><p> While a broad, uncaptured audience is in need of financial education, RIA&rsquo;s need to become literate on issues that matter to the next generation of investors. In other words, they need to speak the language that their intended audience speaks in order to elevate financial literacy.</p><p> <strong>  First, understand what younger clients are trying to accomplish.  </strong> Learn their financial point of view and respect it. Don&rsquo;t assume, for instance, that their needs revolve around wanting to buy a home; Millennials will own real estate at a lower percentage rate than the previous generation. So, consider that your assumptions may not be in sync with their priorities. Help them align money with their current lifestyle and the desires they express. Once they can relate financial understanding to their life, they&rsquo;ll gain the confidence to address long-term goals more assertively.</p><p> <strong>  Recognize that Millennials have had a different experience than Baby Boomers or Gen X&rsquo;ers. </strong>  Millennials saw two stock market collapses on their way from high school to adulthood. They grew up in an environment where those with debt were watched as family and friends were squeezed hard during the housing crisis and in the corresponding credit crunch. Result: They are savers, not investors, by nature. They are skittish about markets and skeptical of the Wall Street establishment. That&rsquo;s a barrier you&rsquo;ll need to break down. As discussed in my  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/northwestern-mutual-lifes-learnvest-acquistion-lessons-for-rias/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  prior post on LearnVest </a> , understanding the saver mindset is key to engaging Millennials.</p><h3> Go where they go to learn. </h3><p> <br/> Ever see a twenty-something online at a coffee shop? Chances are that they are absorbed in checking out something on their smartphone &ndash; updates on Instagram, checking out Twitter, messaging friends or reading articles that interest them. Make sure that your content is compelling and shareable, because your story will more likely reach them in their social media feeds than on traditional news sites. Sure, they&rsquo;ll be impressed if your insight shows up in the New York Times or in the Huffington Post, but you have to make sure it is pushed to them.</p><h3> Be tuned into wellness. </h3><p> <br/> Thirty nine percent of Millennials worry about their financial future &ldquo;at least once a week,&rdquo; according to a Fidelity study, <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/financial-literacy-month-should-be-calling-for-rias-not-a-marketing-gimmick/#_edn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [ii] </a>  and more than half (54%) cite debt as their biggest financial concern. <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/financial-literacy-month-should-be-calling-for-rias-not-a-marketing-gimmick/#_edn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [iii] </a>  That&rsquo;s a cry for stability. They may be burdened by student loans or saddled with debt from early financial missteps, and now shy away from important decisions. Teach them to identify what factors have driven their financial decisions to date, and explain why those drivers are financially sound or not. Some firms have recognized this and have gone so far as to recast their brand around this. A great example is our client, United Capital, which adopted &ldquo;Financial Life Management&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;Private Wealth Counseling&rdquo; in its positioning. United Capital does an especially nice job in framing that fresh approach here.</p><p> Financial literacy is a two-way street. Before advisors can reach out to Millennials with tools and tactics for financial management, they first have to reach a credible understanding of the generational mindset. Only then can advisors provide the peace of mind younger clients want and the guidance they need.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Clever people will recognize &amp; tolerate nothing but cleverness.   ~ <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri-Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Amiel\" target=\"_blank\">   Henri Frederic Amiel  </a> </u></p><p> I am often asked how do you really find a top performing sales professional?  What characteristics or qualities can you readily identify that will ensure you&rsquo;ve got a winner?  That takes me back to what my own sales manager advised me when I was replacing him and asked to a top performing sales role to my first &ldquo;gig&rdquo; as a sales manager:   &ldquo;Hire&rsquo;em, train&rsquo;em, send&rsquo;em out, then watch&rsquo;em like a hawk!&rdquo;</p><p> I wish it were as simple.  Looking back now, I can clearly see what mistakes I made when I started and find it easy to identify new or bad managers based on repeating those same mistakes.  Good and bad managers will be left for another blog while I tackle this weighty question:  <strong>  How do you reduce your risk of making a bad hire in sales? </strong></p><h3> Initially, you have to understand what type of sales professional you looking for. </h3><p> <br/> <br/> Most organizations will say they're looking for \"Hunters\" and not order takers.  What they mean is someone who can drum up new business.  They can be titled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_development\" target=\"_blank\">   Business Development  </a> </u>  Representative&rdquo; or simply &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales\" target=\"_blank\">   Sales Representative  </a> </u> &rdquo;.  They are more easily identified when you take the time to understand the Hunter mentality:</p><li> Short sales cycles</li><li> High call rate/activity (they will look and sound busy)</li><li> Transactional sales:  Find&rsquo;em and Close&rsquo;em and Move on</li><li> Someone else takes care of the follow through (deliverables, implementation), follow up and customer satisfaction</li><li> They should be armed with lots of marketing pieces and tools to sell</li><li> They will rarely make formal presentations or get involved with RFPs</li><li> The call types are usually small to medium-sized businesses</li><li> Networking to them is to gather as many contacts as possible</li><li> They don&rsquo;t need leads, but appreciate being fed leads once in a while</li><li> They tend to turnover quicker because what attracts them to hunting may also go hand in hand with becoming bored with doing the same thing over and over again.</li><li> Hunters aren&rsquo;t as respected amongst colleagues because others tend to have to do clean up from the &ldquo;sell at all costs&rdquo; mentality.</li><li> Make sure they are base salary + commission &ndash; reward based on results</li><li> They will thrive in a competitive environment &ndash; post stats or sales scoreboards &ndash; that motivates them to see themselves on the top</li><li> Don&rsquo;t expect them to be a team player in the office because their game is winning sales, not fans</li><li> They excel at &ldquo;feature dumps&rdquo; and may be more technically savvy with every gadget known to speed up sales</li><li> They may be annoyed by too many meetings or impatient with training that takes them out of the hunt</li><li> What paperwork?  You want them to make calls right?  Enter information into a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system &ndash; yeah, right, whatever you say &hellip; then back out they go.</li><li> They may drive you crazy when you have to constantly remind them to complete administrative tasks.  On time?  When&rsquo;s that?</li><li> There will be several fish stories and a few whales that got away</li><li> Research for leads is scanning newspapers or web Career Section</li><li> In when the boss is, lunch with \"prospects\" and out of the office at 5 <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re still gungho on taking on a Hunter, you should have a plan on how you will take care of existing customers or new customers once they&rsquo;re signed. </strong>   For the sake of clarity, we&rsquo;ll call them Customer Service.  Here are questions that should be addressed:</p><li> Are these personnel trained to handle complex issues?</li><li> If existing customers are your bread and butter, should they be left in the hands of someone who may not be your most experienced employee?  </li><li> Is there an elevation process to move up quickly to solve issues?</li><li> Does someone proactively call on customers before issues come up?</li><li> Who monitors your company's service level agreements are being met? </li><li> Does anyone personally call on the your customer's place of business?</li><li> How do you promote new product offerings to existing customers?</li><li> Do you identify customers levels?  By revenue?  How they do business? Or frequency?   i.e. Business to Business (B2B),  mid-level, major accounts or enterprise.</li><li> Who can keep track of whether competitors are swimming around your customers, low-balling to get in the door, and you only find out after they've already left by the donut crumbs (zeros) on the revenue sheet?</li><li> If you bog your sales reps down with administrative tasks, writing their own proposals, composing RFPs from scratch, doing their own estimating, etc. etc. is it fair to call them a Hunter?</li><p> <br/> What often paralyses organizations is when you point out  &ldquo;take care of your customers and your customers will take care of the bottom line&rdquo; ...  or,  it takes 85% more effort to attract a new customer than it takes to keep existing customers happy.  This is where there is a disconnect.  Organizations want to pay someone commission to find the new customer and then have them move on to find more.   That is fine as long as you understand:</p><li> How do you define new business?  New customers or net new revenue?</li><li> Who manages the relationship with the customer?</li><li> How are you going to take care of new customers once they sign on?</li><li> Do you know whether the customer bought the person selling them just as much as the organization, service, product?</li><li> At what stage or how do they transition from the rep to someone else?</li><li> How complicated is the sales process?  </li><li> Is pre- and post-sales support required?</li><li> How long are the sales cycles?</li><li> Is your offering transactional business that churns quickly?</li><li> Do you support sales efforts with captivating marketing or sales tools like brochures, samples or demos?</li><li> How accurately are the territories aligned?</li><li> Are you giving kudos to a rep who carries a $750,000 territory and increases new business by 10% and not to another rep who carries $1.5 million but only increases new business by 5%?</li><p> <br/> If you want your sales reps to do the hunting while the organization takes care of the business they sell, that is completely fine.  However, depending on the answers above, sales cycle, ongoing involvement required, you may hire an Account Executive or Account Manager.  They come packaged looking like a  &ldquo;Farmer&rdquo; with most or all of the following attributes:</p><li> Builders of strong and lasting relationships</li><li> Not as high activity as their Hunter counterparts; there is a balance between hunting versus taking care of existing customers; more of latter</li><li> They will be thorough because they care about their reputation</li><li> They can be annoying by being actively concerned and want to be involved during any implementation process</li><li> They will do follow up, know everyone and everything about the customer</li><li> They&rsquo;ll research a prospect, understand who&rsquo;s who, what&rsquo;s before they pick up the phone or enter the premises</li><li> Networking to them is within the context of their customers' industry so they can attend their events, see them in their own environment, with their peers and learn more about the customer's business</li><li> Yes, they appear to spend time doing pretty power points customized to who/what they&rsquo;re presenting</li><li> They rely on referrals more than cold calls, because they&rsquo;re warm and a testiment to their hard work and reputation</li><li> The new business  may not be from brand new customers, but from brand new individuals or departments within their customer base</li><li> There will be little clean up from over promising and under delivering</li><li> They will have  ideas on how to make the life of &ldquo;their&rdquo; customers easier</li><li>  They won&rsquo;t turnover, as long as you recognize the value they bring</li><li> Don&rsquo;t criticize their sales efforts, new business means new revenue </li><li>  Paperwork will usually be detailed, updates whether you want it or not</li><li>  CRMs are conscientiously updated because they want to track and remember each customer as though each one is their only one (that is how they will be treated)</li><li> They won&rsquo;t mind meetings as long as it is discussing their customers, resolving issues, coming up with innovative ideas to manage customers better.</li><li> You may wonder if that rep leaves if that customer will leave with them?</li><li> They will be more of a team player because they&rsquo;re open to learning better ways to retain their customers or new avenues to create revenue from their warm pool.</li><li> Chances are while everyone else is sharing whale tales or discussing sports scores, they're at their customer's office or working at their desk; they'd rather not discuss it until its done</li><li> You probably don't notice what time they start in the morning, unless it seems late, failing to notice dark circles under their eyes <br/>  </li><p> This sometimes circles back to organizations rethinking the original complaint that they want hunters.  Many sales managers fall short on this area.  Especially new sales managers.  Ask yourself:  as long as revenue is growing, what is the problem with feeding off existing customers?  The predisposition is to expect new customers.  Many executives love the war stories of Hunters and think that they must be doing extraordinary. What is wrong  with new revenue channels from existing customers?  Aren&rsquo;t the results the same?  The challenge being, you can't rely on existing customers in the long run.</p><p> As a matter of fact, most end up with Farmers because they actually prefer the behaviours of a Farmer.  They are easier to manage.  They don&rsquo;t turnover as much, nor do they strain the organization resources as much as a hunter does.  </p><p> <strong>  By now, you may be irritated.  What you really want is new revenue.  Well, then you have to decide what that new revenue will look like and how it will be managed once it arrives. </strong> <br/> <br/> Often times, the people doing the pre-screening are not sales people.  Unfortunately, the mediocre sales pros are sometimes better at selling themselves than producing results.  The Hunter is who HR tends to gravitate towards if they're pressured to hire someone that can sell.  In some circles, Hunters can be stereotyped as &ldquo;bottom feeders&rdquo;.  From my perspective, if you're not careful, they'll tell you what you want to hear then afterwards eat your bottom line.</p><p> Personally, I&rsquo;d opt for the person who is attentive, appears to be somewhat humble, and asks great questions.  I understand that high turnover in sales actually detracts from creating revenue streams.  Many short-lived sales people result from being fakes, not being able to add value or deliver results.  I get it that there are ones that may actually look like a Farmer but still have the Hunter instincts.  That's when you have found Utopia.</p>",

    "link": "mastering-the-mix-of-client-appreciation-prospecting-through-client-events",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Event planning can be challenging as you strive to master the right mix of expressing appreciation to existing clients and prospect for new business. </strong> The question most financial advisors ask us is, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t more clients attend my events and why won&rsquo;t they bring a guest?&rdquo;</p><p> The answer most often is that your event topic doesn&rsquo;t capture their interest or is just plain boring. Events, like marketing messages, must be carefully crafted for a select group of people to garner their attention. If your topic doesn&rsquo;t resonate with them, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely they will attend.  </p><p> Effective event planning relies on your ability to address pressing pain points in the lives of your target audience and create strategies to reach and influence them. Reframe your approach by utilizing the following outline when planning your events:</p><h3> Identify Your Audience</h3><p> <br/> Just as your marketing processes need to move away from an old school batch and blast method, your event planning needs to do the same. Segment your clients into groups who share the same profession, are in a related stage of life, or face similar obstacles and challenges.</p><h3> Ask Clients For Their Opinion</h3><p> <br/> Talk to your clients. Ask them what subject matters they want to learn about. Your clients concerns can create opportunities for event themes you may not have considered.</p><h3> Schedule Smaller Events</h3><p> <br/> Client events should not be a &ldquo;one-size-fits-all.&rdquo; Trying to please all of your clients, who have a wide range of different needs, is rarely effective. The better approach is to hold more events that are smaller in nature and appeal to a specific group of people. Small events give you the opportunity to spend quality time with clients showing your appreciation.</p><h3> Plan to Prospect</h3><p> <br/> We all know that not planning is planning to fail. Make a point to prospect on purpose. Once you have determined your guest list, allow time for research. Who is in your clients&rsquo; network that you want to meet? Rather than suggesting they bring a guest, ask them to bring a specific person you would like to get to know. </p><h3> Pick Up The Phone</h3><p> <br/> Call everyone on your invitation list to confirm their attendance. Let them know you have a spot reserved for them and their guests. A confirmation call creates a sense of accountability on the clients&rsquo; part.  </p><h3> Get To Know Your Guests</h3><p> <br/> Make time to talk to your clients and guests at your event. Get to know them and show interest in their lives outside of the business world. What are their hobbies and interests? Shared pastimes can provide another opportunity for you to spend quality time with a new prospect.</p><h3> Thank Your Clients</h3><p> <br/> Call your clients and thank them for attending and for bringing a guest. Let them know you appreciate their loyalty and that you&rsquo;ll be sending a gift card to their favorite restaurant. Mail the gift card with a hand written thank you note.</p><h3> Schedule One-On-One Time</h3><p> <br/> Make a personal phone call thanking new prospects for attending. Use this opportunity to ask for feedback and what questions they may have. Schedule a time to answer their questions in person, over coffee, or lunch. Scheduling a casual get-together is less intrusive than asking for an appointment immediately after your event.    </p><h3> Create A Sales Process</h3><p> <br/> Keep new prospects engaged with your firm by moving them into your sales funnel. Develop a process to ensure you stay top of mind, continue to provide regular industry updates, and establish a stronger relationship with them. </p><p> Hosting small targeted events may require more work on your part. But the bottom line is; if you know more about your clients and their network of friends, you&rsquo;ll create higher attendance rates and host a more successful event. </p>",

    "content": "<p> As investment professionals, we know that clients may often need our help in maintaining a longterm perspective on their investments. Helping clients understand how their money is working for them is the key to helping them maintain commitment to their financial plans. In this article, we will discuss three ways to help clients organize their investments. By delivering a realistic road map to clients, illustrating their financial future, you can help them remain confident and on course toward successful outcomes.</p><p> One of the main behavioral biases is mental accounting. &ldquo;Many behavioral economists say mental accounting (i.e. treating different piles of money with different intentions) helps trick your brain into better budgeting and saving. It&rsquo;s really a take on the classic envelope system, where you allocate your paycheck to a weekly or monthly budget and put the cash in different envelopes &mdash; one for each budget category. Once the envelopes are empty, your budget is maxed out.&rdquo; 1 However, mental accounting can have many drawbacks. If investment portfolios are not structured in an organized way, clients can become confused about how each part of the allocation is intended to perform. When mental accounting comes into play, clients can lose sight of their overall plan and the roles that each part of their investments plays in their lives. A standalone aggressive equity strategy might be quite a risky prospect on its own; but if the client understands that it is his or her longer-term money that won&rsquo;t be touched for ten plus years, it becomes more palatable. As investment professionals we have the potential to deliver significant value by helping clients create a cohesive strategy for their financial future.</p><p> <b>  Here are three ways you can help clients maintain a comprehensive, long term perspective on their investments. </b></p><h3> Use a Segmented or Bucket Approach to Spread Out Risk Over Time</h3><p> <br/> One approach that can help is segmenting the assets into what we&rsquo;ll call buckets. Shorter term money that will be used in one to three years, stays in money markets. Risk gradually is ratcheted up as you move from short-term assets to long-term assets. Long-term assets can be positioned more aggressively for growth. This approach uses time as a risk management tool. As discussed in other <i>  Navigator Insights </i>  there are several ways to manage risk. But the key is to help clients understand that if a long- term bucket suffers a decline in value, there is plenty of time to make up for it. They may be less likely to make a panicked decision during a down market if they see that their shorter-term money has been safeguarded.</p><h3> Incorporate Personal Benchmarks to Help Clients Stay Focused on Their Own Needs</h3><p> <br/> Personal benchmarks can help clients stay focused on their needs not just on market results. The Certified Financial Planner program highlights the importance of using software such as a Monte Carlo system to help clients understand the probability of achieving their required rate of return. However, investment proposals generally only compare an investment strategy against an index benchmark such as the S&amp;P 500. By helping clients identify their personal required rate of return and relating that rate of return to their investment strategies via a &ldquo;personal benchmark,&rdquo; our industry can help clients remain focused on what&rsquo;s relevant to their needs.</p><h3> Consider Unified Managed Accounts to Stay Organized and Stay Focused</h3><p> <br/> A unified managed account (UMA) system can help clients maintain focus and perspective on their overall investment strategy. It can help you deliver a high degree of personalization while also streamlining your practice. The right UMA software can cut down on the paperwork clients receive, and it can help clients see the importance of each piece of their financial puzzle. It can help you de-clutter your office, get rid of operational headaches, and free up more time to spend with clients. In addition, by simplifying the investment allocation into one account number per registration, you can spend more time focusing on the whole picture of financial planning. By taking some of the heavy lifting out of the investment side of your practice, you can spend more time in client meetings focusing on the entire suite of your services. Ultimately, UMA technology can help you spend more time on other parts of your practice &mdash; specifically, the services that differentiate you as an advisor.</p><h3> Helping Clients Navigate Their Future</h3><p> <br/> We believe these three strategies are most effective when they are tied together as a comprehensive solution. Combining personal benchmarks, a bucket system, and UMA technology can help you differentiate your practice and help clients navigate their future. This is particularly true when you provide clients with a clear and simple road map for their income plan. Once clients see the benefit of organizing their investment strategies into a UMA, they may see the benefit of working with one advisor instead of spreading their investments across multiple financial advisors. This can ultimately give you the opportunity to make a more positive difference in your clients&rsquo; lives.</p>1.

    "content": "<p> A story at WaPo called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/20/this-chart-explains-everything-you-need-to-know-about-inequality/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   This chart explains everything you need to know about inequality  </a> </u>  gives the following very interesting graphic:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1103\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1-INCOMES.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> It plots the average income for the top 1% horizontally against the average income for the bottom 90% (vertically) in year-by-year dots, showing that from the 1930s to the mid-1970s, only the bottom 90% saw incomes rise meaningfully. Since the mid-1970s, only the top 1% have seen incomes rise meaningfully. <br/> <br/> The author of the WaPo piece tries to paint an explanatory narrative around fiscal policy, blaming Reagan's tax reforms (which favored the rich) for the sudden shift in incomes, which is silly, because taxation is taxation and income is income. You have to make an income for it to be taxed. The Reagan tax reforms have little to do with what's going on in this graph. <br/> <br/> If you want to understand income inequality, you have to be willing to look at the bigger picture of what happened to wages after the introduction of mass-produced computer technology in the mid-1970s.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"321\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2-productivity.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p> Various versions of this graph can be found all over the Internet and economists agree on the fundamental soundness of the underlying data. The graph basically shows that wages parted company from productivity in the 1970s. The epochal event that transformed economic reality in the mid-1970s was the introduction of mass-produced microprocessor technology, first in pocket calculators, then in affordable computers. <br/> <br/> Not coincidentally, the mid-1970s was (were?) also when the 1% started to see their incomes explode.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3-top1percent.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p> It's not hard to understand what happened, although economists, as a group, seem to be incredibly dense on this point. Computer technology allowed radical increases in productivity. But when you hand a business owner a radical increase in efficiency, the business owner doesn't react by paying people more, or hiring more people, etc. He or she simply pockets the efficiency gain, whenever possible. (\"Margin expansion\" is one name for this.) <br/> <br/> The fantastic efficiency gains made possible by computers (and Internet and mobile) have mostly not been passed through to consumers. They've been pocketed by the winners. That's what's going on here. It's not rocket surgery. <br/> <br/> The other aspect to computer technology (computers, Internet, mobile) that's wrecking the Old Economic Order is the ability of computation to put people out of work. Some extreme examples:</p><li> At its peak in 1988, Kodak, the iconic American photography company, had 145,000 employees. By 2010, digital cameras were in cell phones. In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy.</li><li> When Facebook purchased WhatsApp for $19 billion, WhatsApp had 55 employees serving 450 million customers.</li><li> Uber, an app created by two guys, is putting around 100,000 cab drivers out of work. In 2000, there were 233,000 cab drivers in the U.S. We don't know how many there are today, but in San Francisco,  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3397919/uber-taxis-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\">   average monthly trips by cab have fallen 65% since Uber came along  </a> </u> .</li><p> According to Uber, <u>     <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/05/27/ubers-remarkable-growth-could-end-the-era-of-poorly-paid-cab-drivers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the median wage for an UberX driver working at least 40 hours a week in New York City is $90,766 a year. In San Francisco, the median wage for an UberX driver working at least 40 hours a week is $74,191  </a> </u> . Does that sound like a plan for reducing income inequality? Or increasing it? <br/> <br/> The standard dogma preached by economists is that people displaced by technology will find more meaningful knowledge-based work elsewhere. This was true, for a while. If you lost your job in the shoe factory, you could go back to school and become a programmer. <br/> <br/> But now we outsource a lot of programming jobs to eastern Europe, India, etc. So that strategy doesn't work very well.</p><p> <strong>  So go back to school and become a doctor or a teacher. Right?  <br/>  <br/>  That doesn't work either now. </strong> <br/> <br/> From <u>     <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/robert-reich-our-horrifying-future-very-few-people-will-have-work-or-make-money\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a story at alternet.org  </a> </u> :</p><p> In coming years, software apps will be doing many of the things physicians, nurses, and technicians now do (think ultrasound, CT scans, and electrocardiograms).</p><p> Actually, think  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery\" target=\"_blank\">   surgery  </a> </u> . Many procedures (try  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/09/robot-surgery-fda/2067629/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   400,000 a year  </a> </u> ) are robotic now.</p><p> Meanwhile, the jobs of many teachers and university professors will disappear, replaced by online courses and interactive online textbooks.</p><p> You can pooh-pooh these trends all you want, but the fact is, the economy is being transformed and millions of people are either being put out of work or having their jobs crapified into part-time/on-call work with few or no benefits; \"efficiencies\" are accruing to the few at the expense of the many. And technology is the key. <br/> <br/> Bottom line, the era of \"technological unemployment\" (a term coined by Keynes in 1930) is at hand, and in the new economic version of musical chairs,  <u>  <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-technological-roots-of-income.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the winners only get richer, not more numerous  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "link": "employers-bias-against-aging-boomers",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The job market is improving, but more than  <u>  half of baby boomers </u>  surveyed felt age discrimination &ldquo;prevented them from working as much as they would like.&rdquo; Squared Away interviewed <strong>  Joanna Lahey, associate professor at Texas A&amp;M University&rsquo;s Bush School of Government and Public Service </strong> , who says age discrimination is extremely difficult to &ldquo;prove.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Many older workers have legitimate complaints about being discriminated against.  But what does the research tell us about how pervasive it is? </strong></p><p> Lahey: Before I answer that, let me clarify something.  Older people who are working do well compared to younger workers.  On average, they have more money and stability. It&rsquo;s the older job seekers whose experiences worry policy makers and researchers.</p><p> The bottom line is we really don&rsquo;t know how pervasive age discrimination is, and there&rsquo;s a lot of room for more research on this. In one experiment I did, younger workers were 40 percent more likely to be called back for an interview than older workers &ndash; but that was only women, and they were applying only for entry-level positions.</p><p> Age and experience are correlated with each other, so it&rsquo;s really hard for researchers to tell if someone&rsquo;s being discriminated against because of their age or because of some sort of mismatch between older workers&rsquo; more extensive experience and the job requirements.</p><p> <strong>  The U.S. unemployment rate was a low 5.5 percent in March.  Doesn&rsquo;t age discrimination fade when employers are hiring? </strong></p><p> Lahey: There are three different answers.  First, someone needs to do age discrimination experiments in places with high and low unemployment rates and make comparisons &ndash; there&rsquo;s one being run now.</p><p> A second answer is that in one study I did, it was much better for an older worker to get, say, an LPN degree and apply to be a nurse &ndash; a profession with low unemployment &ndash; than to apply for a job with a higher unemployment rate such as a clerical worker. At the same time, the amount of age discrimination I measured was much greater for nursing than for clerical work or retail sales.  But although younger workers were far more preferred for the nursing jobs, nursing was also still the best bet for an older worker.</p><p> A third answer is a new research paper looking at the effectiveness of age discrimination laws finds that it&rsquo;s easier to discriminate against older workers during recessions. An explanation might be that it&rsquo;s harder to prove discrimination when employers are laying off lots of people.</p><p> <strong>  What other difficulties are there in gauging age discrimination? </strong></p><p> Lahey: It could be that more experienced people expect to have higher wages, and they&rsquo;re not accepting jobs because they want a higher wage than a younger person would accept.  So when we see that it takes longer for an older person to get a job, we don&rsquo;t know if the employer is discriminating against them or if this older worker expects to be rewarded for this experience, even though the job may not be paying that.  That&rsquo;s not discrimination, and from a research perspective, it&rsquo;s very hard to disentangle these things.</p><p> Also, researchers can&rsquo;t just compare older and younger workers with the same experience, because you expect older people to have more experience. If the older person doesn&rsquo;t have more experience, that might be a signal to the employer that there&rsquo;s something wrong with them. If they do have experience, it&rsquo;s very hard to understand, what does this experience mean?</p><p> <strong>  As baby boomers age, has there been an increase, as expected, in age discrimination cases? </strong></p><p> Lahey: Yes, it&rsquo;s going up over time, and you can see the effect of the baby boomers aging underlying the trend.  For example, in 1997 the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) received <a href=\"http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/adea.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">  15,785 </a>  charges under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and in 2014 that number had increased to 20,588. But there is also a pattern of more complaints during recessions &ndash; in 2008, the EEOC received 24,582 ADEA complaints. The number has gone down since the 2008-2009 recession, probably because instead of suing, older people are more likely to just get another job.</p><p> <strong>  Is age discrimination more difficult to prove than discrimination based on race or sex? </strong></p><p> Lahey: Yes. Age discrimination legislation is different than Civil Rights Act legislation.  The U.S. Supreme Court over the years has made things more or less difficult [for older employees], and right now it&rsquo;s in a more difficult phase.  In practice, to prove age discrimination, you need a smoking gun, like having a supervisor or manager who&rsquo;s written a memo or said something ageist in front of people &ndash; and it has to be pretty explicit, say using the word &ldquo;geezers.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Is it clear that it takes longer for older people to get hired than younger people with similar qualifications? </strong></p><p> Lahey: We definitely know that it takes longer. According to an AARP study of Bureau of Labor Statistics data in December 2014, it takes five months longer.  That&rsquo;s not a new problem &ndash; the number may change but the gap has been there.  It was prominently written about in 1984 and probably existed well before then.  Of course, we don&rsquo;t know how much of this is discrimination and how much is older workers being picky because they can retire, or hang out with their grandkids, or they might have more savings.</p><p> My work has shown that age discrimination certainly exists, but much more work needs to be done before we can understand the true extent of this discrimination.</p><p> <strong>  Describe your experiment showing that older women are treated differently in the job market. </strong></p><p> Lahey: During the 2003 recession, I sent out thousands of resumes for women of different ages to all the entry-level jobs I could find in Boston newspapers and online in St. Petersburg. I sampled 40 jobs every week in each city and sent out two resumes for each job &ndash; one from Mary and one from Linda.  When I measured the response rate by the date of their high school graduation, younger workers were 40 percent more likely to be called back for an interview than an older worker.</p><p> <strong>  Why did you study only women? </strong></p><p> Lahey: I picked women, because when men apply for an entry-level job, employers may really worry about an older man with gaps in his experience, especially with older age groups who probably were not being stay-at-home husbands. If women have gaps in their experience, employers assume they were taking care of kids.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Imagine this scenario.  The person making all financial decisions was the man of the house.  His somewhat timid wife, married to him for many years, never wanted the responsibility to decide how to invest. They had a multimillion dollar estate. Then Harry, her husband died and she was totally unprepared.</p><h3> That&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rosanna&rsquo;s&rdquo; story.  </h3><p> <br/> Rosanna was married for decades to Harry who passed away at age 85. She was 82 at the time.  They had three adult daughters and one son, Jackson. Their son was never a steady job holder and had fantasies of how he was going to be a business owner. After his father died, he saw an opportunity.  He could easily manipulate his mother, who looked to him to essentially take Harry&rsquo;s place with decisions about investments. Rosanna had begun to suffer serious memory problems and couldn&rsquo;t remember a conversation from morning to evening. She was clearly a person with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/diminishedcapacitywebinar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   diminished capacity  </a> </u> . </p><p> <strong>  Jackson was a co-trustee on the parents&rsquo; trust with his mother and sisters </strong> , but had sole power to make investment decisions. He conspired with the long time broker-dealer who used to work with his father.  The broker also saw an opportunity.  The broker told Jackson that he could help him out but Jackson needed to put a lot more of Rosanna&rsquo;s money into variable annuities. What this meant was that her money would be tied up for years, unless she paid a stiff surrender charge to get to it.  A full 87% of Rosanna&rsquo;s money was then shifted into variable annuities. When Harry died, the amount invested in annuities was about 40%, which was plenty. This shift of most assets into annuities of course generated a huge commission for the broker.  About the same time, Jackson took a six-figure loan from Rosanna&rsquo;s trust without consulting his sisters and without informing them.</p><p> <strong>  They were angry and upset with Jackson for manipulating their mother </strong> , for taking out a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; from their mother&rsquo;s trust, which he didn&rsquo;t pay back and for sneaking around behind their backs putting so much into variable annuities. That was going to affect their inheritance.  When the sisters called me, we discussed the issue of manipulation of their mother. No one had ever checked her out for her capacity for financial decisions. When her daughters wanted her to see a doctor to find out more about her memory troubles, Jackson vetoed it.  Rosanna consulted Jackson on everything.   This meant that legal action was necessary.  I referred them to an elder abuse attorney to take up the cause.  They were very distressed and not speaking to Jackson. Meanwhile, Jackson again manipulated his mother to get money from her, with which he hired an attorney to harass and threaten the sisters.  It was ugly.</p><p> No one can be sure how this nasty tale will play out, but the regulators will probably not like the fact that the broker put so much of an 85 year old&rsquo;s assets into variable annuities.  They will probably not like that he had to override his firm&rsquo;s internal controls set up to prevent that.  They will probably not like the fact that the net result is that the estate lost a significant sum compared with what it would have done in conventional investments suitable for an 85 year old.  I sent the sisters the forms to file complaints with both FINRA and the SEC.  They will also have an attorney to represent them in that matter.</p><p> <strong>  And as for Jackson, I hope that the courts will deal with him justly. </strong>  He is looking out for himself, that is clear.  As a trustee, he had a legal duty to the trust, not to his own self interest in grabbing a six figure &ldquo;loan&rdquo; from the trust that he had no means to repay.</p><p> The takeaway here is that your aging clients, particularly the very unsophisticated ones like Rosanna are sitting ducks for abuse by unscrupulous brokers. And it is up the the advisors who are ethical to blow the whistle.  It is up to everyone to seek justice for the unwary who become victims of manipulation because of greed, the ease of taking advantage of an elder, and the attitude that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not my problem, she&rsquo;s not my client&rdquo;.  Please make it your business.  At  <a href=\"http://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AgingInvestor.com </a> , we want to put a stop to this kind of abuse.  We urge you to join us!</p>",

The movie tells the story of the battle between man and machine and that&rsquo;s the battle that many in the advice industry see looming in the not too distant future.</p><h3> The &lsquo;robos&rsquo; are coming and it will get bloody, of that there is no doubt.</h3><p> <br/> But I would argue that the better advisers shouldn&rsquo;t even be on the field of battle, let alone being killed off.</p><p> Last month I appeared on a panel at the ifa Business Strategy Days held over three sessions in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne.</p><p> While the experience in each state was a little different the key theme was consistent, advisers are struggling with what I will call the value conundrum.</p><p> Many advisers assume that their investment prowess is what their clients most value, their ability to pick stocks/managed funds or rebalance their portfolios and they feel that if they let this go their value disappears or is greatly diminished.</p><p> However countless surveys and studies (not to mention adviser experience) suggests that the investment piece is not what our clients value, instead they rate relationships and communication as being the most important elements.</p><p> To best illustrate this here&rsquo;s an anecdotal story of a conversation I had after one of my panel appearances.</p><p> An adviser came up to me and wanted to understand what I meant when I said that in my business we &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; our investment service.</p><p> Having explained this to him he looked at me with genuine puzzlement and said &ldquo;well, what do you for your clients&rsquo; then?&rdquo;</p><p> I asked the fellow to think back over his 30-year career and consider all of the great successes he&rsquo;s enjoyed with his clients, the days where he felt really good about the work that he does, the moments where he genuinely changed peoples&rsquo; lives.</p><p> You could almost see the epiphany unfolding as he said to me &ldquo;it&rsquo;s never been about the investments has it?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The reality is that your clients are crying out for you to redefine your value proposition to match what&rsquo;s important to them. </strong></p><p> So here&rsquo;s the irony &ndash; clients value the relationships we create with them, they value our guidance and counsel and deep down most advisers accept this.</p><p> These are the very components and elements of what we do that robo-advisers cannot yet compete with.</p><p> Why then continue to flaunt your investment prowess as your value proposition, why let the investment piece take up so much of your time with clients?</p><p> This behaviour will put you in direct competition on the battlefield with the robos and they will likely beat you; they will be better resourced, cheaper, deliver consistent client experiences and be great at communicating to their investors.</p><p> <strong>  Be clear in your mind where you add genuine value, work through the fear of redefining your value as you see it, and you&rsquo;ll be amazed at the client response. </strong></p><p> You will not even need to step onto the field of battle with the robos because you will have removed yourself from competing around portfolio management.</p><p> Churchill once described Russia as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma &ndash; don&rsquo;t leave your clients feeling the same about your value proposition.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p> ",

Only an estimated 15-20% of companies use data to drive marketing and business decision-making.</p><p> As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/web-analytics-consulting-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a digital marketing firm specializing in web Analytics  </a> </u> , we totally understand why so many executives are reticent to get started. It&rsquo;s easier than ever to begin tracking data, given the new glut of software and built-in social dashboards. However, there are so many different data solutions providers that the task of choosing one in particular can be overwhelming. Futhermore, not everyone has the patience to sift through so much information to find the most actionable points. It takes a special kind of mind to make sense of the complexities associated with Analytics, and to demonstrate the tangible returns that corporate executives want guaranteed before they invest.</p><p> That&rsquo;s where we come in! Mod Girl Marketing covers all the analytical research and delivers easy-to-understand reports, summaries, and strategic counseling to help your business take steps toward greater marketing efficiency. We help you continue doing what works and change the processes that are stagnant.</p><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re still weighing the pros and cons of making the shift to using Analytics in your day-to-day operations, perhaps these five points will sway your decision. </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"950\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-9.43.41-AM.png\" width=\"587\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"935\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-9.43.46-AM.png\" width=\"591\"/></p><h3> 1. Analytics data answers key marketing questions.</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-b2b-content-marketing-trends-consider/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   We use data  </u> </a>  to determine just how effective your company website truly is. Ultimately, you want people to not only SEE your website en masse, but also to stay a while, learn, buy, and buy again. A good website stirs increased interest, builds credibility and drives action. The data we collect answers these common marketing queries:</p><p> - Acquisition: What brings users to your website?</p><p> - Behavior: What do users do once they arrive?</p><p> - Conversion: Did users perform the desired action?</p><h3> 2. You can use Analytics to improve your sales pitch.</h3><p> <br/> Analytics is not only used to sell, cross-sell, and up-sell by illuminating the best marketing opportunities, but also to aid sales representatives. Ted Dunning, chief applications architect for tech company MapR, says that Analytics really helps for companies with big, complex product lines. &ldquo;Predictive Analytics can really help by saying &lsquo;here are the five products that this person is likely to be interested in this quarter&rsquo;,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cmo.com.au/article/563176/how-data-analytics-transforming-b2b-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   he says  </a> </u> . Dunning adds that their automated CRM system also tracks when a person is most receptive to buying.</p><h3> 3. Cut attrition rates with the power of predictive Analytics.</h3><p> <br/> As you know, it&rsquo;s much more expensive to onboard a new customer than it is to retain one.  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/retaining-customers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kissmetricsestimates  </a> </u>  that it could cost up to 7x more to acquire new customers.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cmo.com.au/article/458724/how_predictive_analytics_tackling_customer_attrition_american_express/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A recent CMO Magazine article  </a> </u>  explained how credit card company American Express used predictive Analytics to identify customers who were most likely to defect from their brand and to stage an intervention before it&rsquo;s too late. After they began dabbling in Analytics data, AMEX was able to improve identification of attrition risks by 8.4 times and generate 740% better results.</p><h3> 4. Analytics helps businesses stay competitive.</h3><p> <br/> At Mod Girl Marketing, we treat every business as a unique entity and develop customized business solutions tailored to the individual. That said, it is still important to keep a pulse on what the competition is doing in your industry.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/us-cmos-still-report-making-little-use-of-marketing-analytics-51718/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A recent survey conducted by   </a>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/us-cmos-still-report-making-little-use-of-marketing-analytics-51718/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketing Charts  </a> </u>  found that &ldquo;CMOs expect to almost double the share of their budgets spent on marketing Analytics over the next 3 years (from 6.4% to 11.7%).&rdquo; In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/infographics/what-is-analytics/infographics_ba_2012.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CIOs rank Analytics as the #1 factor  </a> </u>  contributing to a business&rsquo;s competitiveness, according to IBM.

Similarly,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prod-dev.com/research_articles.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the Product Development Institute  </a> </u>  said new product success rates were 3x higher among businesses using advanced market research.</p><p> <strong>  Market Smarter With Mod Girl Marketing </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/17/are-cmos-wasting-money-on-faulty-marketing-analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Venture Beat  </a> </u>  estimates that corporate data will grow 40 percent annually throughout the next decade. &ldquo;Marketers need to get a handle on their data quality,&rdquo; they write. Anywhere between 10 and 25 percent of B2B marketing databases contain errors, which could lead to poor lead generation and improper direct mail campaigns. For a company with 100,000 records, a dirty database could translate to $2 million of money wasted because of poor data quality.</p><p> Mod Girl Marketing can audit your data collection to ensure your information is accurate and well-maintained. We can also ensure that your web Analytics, such as Google Analytics, is set up properly and conversion tracking is installed. We can consult your team on how to properly interpret and use the data to craft effective marketing campaigns. We can establish automated systems that aggregate all your information in a streamlined fashion, and deliver succinct reports along with suggestions for change to make your marketing more effective.</p><p> Want to see how well analytics can work for your company?</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> If something is a \"piece of cake,\" it is effortless. If it is a \"walk in the park,\" it is easy. Combine the phrases into \"Cakewalk,\" however, and the definition turns  elegantly to epic legend. This 85.6 m/281 ft motor yacht embraces material, design, and technology to present the easiest, most effortless yachting experience to date. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-21-at-10.59.19-AM.png\" width=\"856\"/></p><p> MY Cakewalk was constructed in 2010 under the careful hand of Derecktor in Bridgeport, CT. Her steel and aluminum curves, made ever more sensual through the glossy blue exterior, enhance the interior flow. Six decks maintain privacy while inviting social gatherings.

On a coffee mug or on the internet, the feline known as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.grumpycats.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Grumpy Cat  </a> </u>  has been seen millions of times&mdash;and has some money to show for it; which is why her grumpiness can teach us important lessons about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Estate Planning  </a> </u>  upon  <u>  receiving a windfall </u> .</p><p> Grumpy Cat was not always filled with interviews, media appearances, and lucrative sponsorship deals. The owner of Grumpy Cat is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-grumpy-cats-owner-tabetha-bundesen-2014-12\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tabatha Bundeson  </a> </u> , who reports Grumpy Cat is a stage name. The real name of her cat is Tardar Sauce.</p><p> Tardar Sauce is a  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat\" target=\"_blank\">   domestic calico  </a> </u>  who became an internet sensation when her photograph went viral. Ms. Sauce suffers a form of  <u>  <a href=\"http://pets.thenest.com/feline-dwarfism-11803.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   feline dwarfism  </a> </u>  that resulted in a flat face, bubble eyes, and slightly short legs and tail. Since she was discovered, Ms. Sauce can boast of the following achievements:</p><li> Sponsorship opportunities</li><li> A movie and merchandising line</li><li> Co-author of advice books</li><li> Star of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheOfficialGrumpyCat\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SevereAvoidance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   YouTube  </a> </u></li><li> Retains her own manager <br/>  </li><p> The changed fortunes of Ms. Sauce have allowed her owner, Ms. Bundeson to quit her job as a waitress. Late last year, the internet was alight with claims that Ms. Sauce had earned approximately $100 million for her owner. While Ms. Bundeson denies that amount is accurate, it is clear Ms. Sauce pulls down some significant kibble.</p><p> For Ms. Sauce and Ms. Bundeson, these are very good days. For others who experience a sudden windfall, like an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inheritance.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   inheritance  </a> </u>  or gaming win (Mega Millions anyone?), protecting those monies is important because:</p><li> People with little money are rarely sued, while well-known individuals (or, arguably, cats) with a lot of money make better targets</li><li> Sudden wealth that is not properly protected can be subject to divorce or other legal claims</li><li> Your status as a partner in an enterprise may leave you vulnerable to legal action <br/>  </li><p> If you come into money, give thought to its preservation before you start to purchase. You can protect proceeds&mdash;or the earnings of your unusual pet&mdash;through a well-constructed  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  trust </a>  that can handle licensing rights and other profitable opportunities.</p><p> While Ms. Sauce is an unusual case, the use of trusts to protect estate wealth is commonplace. If you come into sudden money, or want to know how best to protect your wealth for yourself and future generations, give us a call</p>",

    "title": "A 7-Point Employee Evaluation Checklist",
    "link": "a-7-point-employee-evaluation-checklist",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> From guest blogger <u>  Wes Houston </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.grapevineevaluations.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Grapevine Evaluations  </u> </a></p><p> <u>  Employee assessments </u>  benefit both employee and supervisor. The employee realizes information about themselves, not previously realized and they give managers insight into the employee&rsquo;s mindset. This provides a foundation for further employee development and, by extension, development of the organization.</p><li> Organizations that want  to contribute to their communities need a collaborative spirit and effective teamwork.</li><li> True collaboration requires members with a common goal and have the relationship skills to help the team run smoothly.</li><li> To develop relationship-building skills an individual needs their own self awareness. People who understand their reasoning and motivations they can better help others develop.</li><li> Assessments  increasing that individual&rsquo;s own self-awareness. <br/>  </li><h3> Consider All 3 Mind Aspects</h3><p> <br/> Evaluations need to complete a picture.  Therefore, they must address all three parts of the mind in evaluations:</p><li> Affective: the feeling part of the mind</li><li> Conative: the striving part of the mind</li><li> Cognitive: the thinking part of the mind</li><p> <br/> All three parts formulate how and what a person feels, acts, or thinks. Assessing only one or two leaves the organization with gaps causing misinterpretation. The information gleaned in an employee assessment allows the Human Resources division of the company to:</p><li> Better assimilate teams. Too similar talents and skills in any team will stunt creativity and decision-making.</li><li> Recruit the best employee fit for a particular job. You know what you need for a specific position.  Knowing a potential member&rsquo;s assessment allows you to match the right person with the job a hand.  Age, sex and religion are permitted evaluation stats.</li><li> Develop skills and optimize talents. When you understand how  employees operate you can develop their abilities and help them better  talents.</li><li> Bring awareness and not overlook.. Assessments can help employees objectively see how the three parts of the mind interact and influence the work. Assessments also highlight areas for improvement and can open a door for dialogue  and strategies that help better communication: <li>  Listen </li> <li>  Collaborate </li> <li>  Be Less defensive, and </li> <li>  Be empathetic toward others who need improvement  <br/>    </li></li><h3> Strategic Approach with Awareness</h3><p> <br/> Results should never be used as an excuse for a person to do things a certain way. Assessments are supposed to increase awareness of self so as to learn to modify effect and skills, working better with  others. The best use of employee assessments is to build cooperation among employees, resulting in a better organization.</p><h3> 5 Point vs 7 Point Likert Evaluation System</h3><p> <br/> Most organizations prefer the five point evaluation system, wherein the supervisor checks:</p><li> Employee Arrives on Time</li><li> Employee is always ready and prepared to work</li><li> Employee is willing to assist others when directed</li><li> Employee completes projects on time and well.</li><li> Employee works well with others and takes instruction well.</li><p> <br/> The five points are each given rating grades for each:</p><li> Poor,</li><li> Needs Improvement,</li><li> Good and</li><li> Excellent <br/>  </li><p> In the 7 Point Likert Evaluation System, more questions deal with the individual&rsquo;s mindset:</p><li> Employee is timely and hard worker</li><li> Employee is knowledgeable about his duties and Works to Learn More</li><li> Employee has good work ethics and applies them to duties</li><li> Employee works well as a team member</li><li> Employee works well as a team leader or supervisor</li><li> Employee has a positive effect on co-workers and their performance</li><li> Employee has potential for supervisory position in future <br/>  </li><p> As in the five point system, the ratings in each of the 7 point categories are:</p><li> Poor,</li><li> Needs Improvement,</li><li> Good and</li><li> Excellent is awarded</li><p> <br/> Most assessment charts  as listed above are for employers and have space for the evaluator to make comments elaborating on some necessary portion of the assessment, along with a space for the employee to sign that he has had his evaluation explained and he agrees with the content.</p><h3> Likert System Usually Requests Degree of Agreement</h3><p> <br/> The Likert 5 point system states a fact and requests the person being examined or assessed to:</p><li> Agree Strongly</li><li> Agree Somewhat</li><li> Have neutral  not Agree nor Disagree Opinion</li><li> Strongly Disagree</li><p> <br/> This assessment is more of a survey than an evaluation, since the subject or topic is being rated with a grade that the evaluators must agree or disagree upon by degree.  It is the assessment most commonly used by commercial enterprises to take the pulse of their current promotional endeavors.</p><h3> Purpose and Benefits</h3><p> <br/> In Likert&rsquo;s 5 point system above, the commercial enterprise received feedback from customers that either dismiss or reinforce their promotional options. In the first two examples of evaluations for employee performance, the employee is shown a rating representing his work performance.</p><p> In a perfect world, the employee would thank the supervisor for the critique, whether good, bad or indifferent, and go off whistling happily that now he understood exactly where he fell short of the company&rsquo;s expectations, and how he can remedy the shortcoming.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Mark Gillen | <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Econnexx  </u> </a></p><h3> How Do Consumers Choose a Financial Service or Product?</h3><p> Do you know why consumers pick your competitor's products over yours?</p><p> Or why they like some of your services and not others?</p><p> With competition for financial services and products fiercer than ever, and consumers a lot more cautious, you need to know exactly what your customer is looking for.</p><p> As you attempt to attract them your way, here are a few statistics to help you understand how  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/blog/10-types-of-financial-clients-and-how-to-reach-them\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial consumers  </a> </u>  make their purchasing decisions.</p><h3> 1. Opening a bank or building society account</h3><p> Between 60% and 80% of people will make the decision to open a bank or building society account on their own. About 10% will compare products before choosing while 10% research information before making a decision. Only about 5% seek professional advice.</p><h3> 2. Taking out a mortgage</h3><p> Up to 40% of the people who take a mortgage seek professional advice before they make their choice. Most well off retired people will make the decision on their own but still take professional advice, compare products or research information about the subject. Those consumers who are hard pressed are the most motivated to seek professional help.</p><h3> 3. Taking out a credit card</h3><p> For consumers who have had a credit card in the past 30% to 50% made the decision on their own with the majority choosing to compare products, research, or seek professional advice.</p><h3> 4. Taking out a car or home insurance</h3><p> Most people who take out a car or home insurance make the decision on their own. Unsurprisingly, a large number also prefer to compare products (up to 40%) or conduct researches (up to 20%) before making a decision.</p><h3> 5. Taking out a life insurance policy, income protection, or critical illness coverage</h3><p> A majority of those who have had the chance to decide on taking out a life insurance policy, income protection, or critical illness coverage made the decision on their own.  Up to 30% take professional advice and 10% to 20% compare or research products.</p><h3> 6. Figuring out what to do with savings</h3><p> Similarly, when it comes to savings, people prefer to make choices on their own. Leading the queue, as you would expect, are those retired and on a budget. However, 5% to 20% of individuals still find product comparison, researching and professional advice helpful.</p><h3> 7. Putting money into a pension plan</h3><p> Most of those who have had the chance to decide whether or not to put money into a pension plan make the decision themselves. A good number (5% to 20%) will seek professional advice.  Alarmingly, very few (no more than 5%) bother comparing options or researching information before making a decision.</p><h3> 8. Applying for a loan</h3><p> Whether or not to apply for a loan is another decision people would rather make alone. Up to 15% say they compare products with another whilst 10% research and between 5% and 10% take professional advice before making a decision.</p><h3> 9. Paying off debt and credit commitments</h3><p> If they are not making a decision themselves, people will rather take professional advice when looking to pay off debt and credit commitments rather than decide with their partner.  Between 5% and 10% compare products or research information before deciding.</p><h3> We Make Financial Decisions Alone</h3><p> When it comes to buying financial products or services it seems that most of us like to make important decisions ourselves or with the help of a financial planner.  We prefer not to make joint decisions with our partners.</p><h3> Market Your Financial Products Intelligently </h3><p> Times have changed; financial services firms who understand how potential customers are researching and deciding what products to buy will steal a march on their competitors.</p><p> Knowing what research terms customers may be using in search engines like Google will allow firms to use the right terminology on their websites and to get found online.</p>",

When your &ldquo;happily&rdquo; turns out to be not so ever-after, consider these tips to help you get to the other side of the rainbow.</p><h3> Look for a divorce attorney.  </h3><p> <br/> Ask for referrals from friends and family.  Take your time to interview multiple attorneys until you find one that you feel comfortable talking to and who will approach the divorce your way.  Follow your instincts.</p><h3> Understand that you are different. </h3><p> <br/> The circumstances surrounding each divorce are unique.  While you are leaning on friends and family for emotional support, be careful not to draw any conclusions based on their experiences. Also, keep in mind that the law, not necessarily your needs, will determine what you&rsquo;re entitled to in the end.</p><h3> Think through the assets. </h3><p> <br/> Your attorney will guide you in determining how to split property, but in making these key decisions, consider the following:</p><li> Don&rsquo;t ask for the home if you can&rsquo;t afford to maintain it.</li><li> Consider taxes in valuing property. Retirement assets (i.e., certain IRA&rsquo;s and 401(k)&rsquo;s) will be taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. You may also pay tax on the sale of property or investments that have increased in value.</li><li> Protect yourself when dividing debt. Consider an indemnity clause in the decree that will allow you to take action if your ex does not pay on a debt. Also, consider a refinancing clause for secured debts (i.e., home or car) to remove your name from any liabilities to be paid by your ex.</li><li> If there are company sponsored retirement plans to be split (i.e., 401(k) or pension), familiarize yourself with the use of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO,  commonly referred to as a &ldquo;quadrow&rdquo;.) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t forget life insurance. If spousal or child support is in play, consider life insurance on your ex to protect future payments. </strong></p><p> Find a planner. To help ensure that you are looking at the big picture, consider working with a financial planner. A planner can provide referrals to, and play quarterback for, many key professionals you may want to consult, including a CPA, estate attorney, real estate agent and mortgage broker. More importantly, a planner will help you plan for your new future.</p><p> While sipping on the apropos cocktail tonight, know that renewal, freshness and harmony will someday be a part of your future again.   <strong>  Cheers to that! </strong></p><p> Not a Subscriber?   <u>  <a href=\"https://app.e2ma.net/app2/audience/signup/1770810/1714656/?v=a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SUBSCRIBE HERE  </a> </u>  for our weekly email.  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Our words reveal our refinements; they tell the discerning listener of the company we have kept; they are the hallmarks of education and culture. &ndash; Dale Carnegie</p><p> Have we lost the art of conversation? Has the digital age with its shortened attention spans and 140 character limits shriveled what was once our primary form of engagement? I think that in some ways it has, but only because we allow it.  Part of that is due to the limitations of digital conversation, but part of it is also the fact that we&rsquo;ve become lazy conversationalists over the past hundred years or so. </p><h3> The Victorians had it Buttoned Down</h3><p> Back in the Victorian era, in-person conversation was the only way to engage with other people, and the art of being a good conversationalist was highly valued. Etiquette and manners were studied carefully. How a person dressed and moved, the modulation of their voice and the topics they chose to discuss were extremely important because of what they revealed about the person. </p><p> These things still reveal a lot about people. That&rsquo;s why when we&rsquo;re talking to someone we&rsquo;ve just met, we tend to take a visual inventory, even if it&rsquo;s on a subconscious level. It helps us learn something about them. How are they dressed? Do they have an accent? Are they loud and crude, or soft-spoken and pleasant? </p><h3> Social Clues</h3><p> Sometimes social clues are left on purpose, to draw other people who share the same interest, such as wearing a sports team jersey, or sporting a particular badge at an event. Others are a little harder to pick up (unless you&rsquo;re observant). </p><p> Clues are often dropped in the form of conversation&mdash;which is why it&rsquo;s important to listen first. Do they talk about their husband, wife or children? Do they like to ski or golf? How do they feel about recent world events? Are they discussing a particular book or publication? Did they move recently? If so, from where? Just as in the Victorian days, when you identify a common interest with someone based on those clues, you open up fertile ground for conversation. More importantly, you demonstrate to the other person that you are fully engaged, giving them the attention that they deserve.</p><h3> Bring Back the Rules of Etiquette</h3><p> Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re often too lazy to pick up on visual or conversation cues today. We don&rsquo;t listen for very long before we jump into conversation. We&rsquo;re so busy thinking of what we&rsquo;re going to say next, that we don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;hear&rdquo; what they&rsquo;re trying to say to us.  And that&rsquo;s just in real-time, person-to-person conversations. How can we bring the art of in-person conversation into digital conversation?</p><p> First, we can start by observing some of the forgotten, but important, Victorian rules of etiquette (taken from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.avictorian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.avictorian.com  </a> </u> ):</p><li> Remember that people are fond of talking of their own affairs. The mother likes to talk of her children, the mechanic of his workmanship, the laborer of what he can accomplish. Give everyone an opportunity, and you will gain much valuable information besides being thought courteous and well bred. </li><li> Beware of talking much about yourself. Your merits will be discovered in due time without the necessity of sounding your own praises.</li><li> Show the courtesy, when another person joins the group where you are relating an incident, of recapitulating what has been said for the advantage of the new-comer.</li><li> Be cool, collected and self-possessed, using respectful, chaste and appropriate language. <br/>  </li><p> While these rules were written in the 1800s, they still apply today! Not only will practicing these rules help our in-person conversations, we can also use digital tools to &ldquo;pick up&rdquo; social clues to improve our online conversations:</p><li> <strong>  Address people by name: </strong>  Even the most sparsely completed social profiles offer the type of information that would take some serious sleuthing to uncover in person. Take the time to find it. If you connect with someone on Twitter with a handle that&rsquo;s obviously not a name, dig for it on another channel and use it when you converse with them. People love to hear their name, and will appreciate that you took the time to find it and address them by it.</li><li> <strong>  Look for commonalities: </strong>  On most social sites, even a relatively empty profile is still likely to include a person&rsquo;s name, their hometown, and a profile photo. You can still find plenty of common ground even with that limited information. Have you been to their hometown? If so, great! If not, work a little Google magic. Most people choose a profile photo that incorporates at least one of their interests. Where was the photo taken? Are there other people in it? What are the people in the photo doing? Every piece of information helps you find that invaluable common ground.</li><li> <strong>  You have the advantage of past conversations: </strong>   We reveal plenty of information about our interests simply by being active on social. Every site is a bit different, but think about all you can learn by reading a connection&rsquo;s recent public @ replies on Twitter, or public timeline posts on Facebook. What they comment on, what they share, and who they share it with can all reveal commonalities that you can use to develop or strengthen the relationship. Show them you&rsquo;re listening by referencing those conversations. <br/>  </li><p> Common sense applies, as always. Bring up something in which a person demonstrated interest over the last few weeks or months, and you demonstrate your attentiveness. Bring up a specific photo or comment your connection posted a few years ago, and you may be unwittingly sending a different message. For one, interests change, especially over the course of years. Why go on dated data when you have the new stuff right in front of you? Additionally, people tend to find it unsettling if you look back too far, which defeats the whole purpose of doing it in the first place. Don&rsquo;t get creepy.</p><p> Here are some more rules from the Victorian era that we would do well to re-apply to today&rsquo;s social conversations:</p><li> Do not manifest impatience.</li><li> Do not engage in argument.</li><li> Do not interrupt another when speaking.</li><li> Do not find fault, although you may gently criticize.</li><li> Do not appear to notice inaccuracies of speech in others. <br/>  </li><h3> Coach Your Employees</h3><p> Do yourself a favor and pass this knowledge on to your customer facing employees as well&mdash;in fact, all of your employees. When you hire well, as the following video indicates, you&rsquo;re not only looking for someone who can do a job&mdash;but for someone who &ldquo;matches&rdquo; your company in terms of their outlook and behavior&mdash;someone you can train easily who &ldquo;gets&rdquo; what your company is all about.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nirg52e9Pww\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-10.31.43-AM.png\" width=\"848\"/> </a></p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re a restaurant owner or the CEO of a B2B company, coaching your existing employees who have a customer facing role on how to be better conversationalists is important, but also look for those qualities in your new hires as well.  There&rsquo;s a reason why many HR professionals look closely at a prospective hire&rsquo;s social profiles. The way we communicate there (as well as in person) says a lot about us as individuals. </p><p> If we all observed these age-old lessons in conversational etiquette it would go a long way toward cleaning up digital conversation, don&rsquo;t you think? Just because our social reach is exponentially larger than it was for Victorians, and our conversations shorter and faster, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should stop practicing the art of being good conversationalists. </p><p> Your company is made up of people and does business with people, so we could all benefit from re-learning the lost art of conversation. The better you are at it, the more it sets you apart as a relationship builder&mdash;and that&rsquo;s more important today than ever.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Millennials have an entrepreneurial spirit and tend to have a lot on their plates. Being able to juggle several balls in the air and multi-task is par for the course for this generation. So why do Millennials often struggle with how to prioritize between saving for the future and paying down debt?</p><p> Many Millennials still have college loans to pay off or have acquired credit card debt while taking home minimal starting salaries. And advice about how to get started is confusing: some financial professionals recommend having at least one month of income saved prior to starting to pay down your debt, while others recommend up to 8 months of savings. That&rsquo;s a daunting prospect when you&rsquo;re young and living from paycheck to paycheck!</p><p> Because of the power of compounding interest, the 20s and 30s are your prime savings years. Not taking advantage of the opportunity to save now may end up costing you later. So how can you start to build your savings and pay down debt, while still maintaining a reasonable quality of life?</p><p> The good news is that &ndash; because they&rsquo;re used to a struggling economy &ndash; Millennials have become very resourceful when it comes to finances. Here are several factors to consider when you&rsquo;re deciding how much you can &ndash; or even if you can &ndash; allocate for both.</p><h3> Three Questions to consider about saving vs. debt:</h3><p> <strong>  What is my monthly incoming &amp; outgoing cash flow? </strong>  Hopefully it&rsquo;s not negative! If it is, though, try to find daily and household expenses that can be trimmed or eliminated (that venti caramel latte? An expensive cable package?) If it&rsquo;s positive, determine if there&rsquo;s enough left over to pay credit card minimums while allocating a portion, however small, toward a saving plan.</p><p> <strong>  What is the interest rate on my debt? </strong>  Debt with an interest rate of higher than 5% is a priority to pay down, otherwise you&rsquo;re spending your hard-earned cash on borrowing costs. Can you roll over your debt to a lower-interest or zero-interest credit card? If not, create an action plan to pay off high-interest debt first. If you have debt with interest rates that are lower than  <strong>  5% </strong> , consider contributing to a  <strong>  401K </strong>  or a  <strong>  Roth IRA </strong> . The same way interest compounds with your debts, it also grows with your savings, so the sooner you take action, the more you will gain over time.</p><p> <strong>  What is my stress level regarding debt? </strong>  If the stress of having debt is overwhelming, then make paying the debt before contributing to your savings a priority. If your debt seems manageable, start getting in the habit of making monthly contributions to a savings plan.</p><p> Remember, no two people, and no two financial plans, are alike. Whether you can contribute to a savings plan and pay down debt simultaneously depends on you and your unique situation.

    "content": "<p> I should start by saying this post serves 3 purposes. It's one part helpful tips (yay!), one part passive-aggressive rant, and one part cathartic self-reflection.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll get the rant out of the way first.</p><p> Last week I was exhausted. My routine was off, and while I enjoyed the additions to my schedule (date nights, wellness events, and a random afternoon excursion), I required power naps and extra under-eye concealer. Throughout the week, I heard my comfy bed and jammies calling my name.</p><p> Most nights, I procrastinate brushing my teeth by perusing the Internet for interesting articles under the guise that it isn&rsquo;t procrastinating since I&rsquo;m bettering myself. That night, I was elated to find an article roughly titled &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Why You&rsquo;re Exhausted.&rdquo; I thought \"Synchronicity!\" My prayers have been answered. Here would be a listicle stating exactly what I needed to do.</p><p> But no. It was an article extolling the virtues of superfoods, gluten-free grains, and herbal tea. Was this information important and valuable? Sure.</p><p> Was it what I wanted? Not so much.</p><p> Could you make a case that my rekindled love of cheese might have played a role in my lethargic dislike for the article? Absolutely maybe.</p><p> What I really needed was someone to sit me down and tell me the exact words I would tell a client the following day:</p><h3> 5 Reasons You're Exhausted All The Time</h3><h3> 1. Your Relationships Suck.</h3><p> No, not everyone in your life needs to go. You don&rsquo;t need to start from scratch. You don&rsquo;t need to write one of those overly-dramatic &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cleaning out my Facebook friends and you&rsquo;ve made the cut&rdquo; posts I see (but wish I hadn&rsquo;t). Maybe only some people suck. Or maybe you&rsquo;re spending too much time with them. Or too little time with the people who energize you. If you&rsquo;re feeling dragged down by negative people, it may be time to do an energetic cleanse. Even if it&rsquo;s just temporary: Take stock, cut cords, feel good.</p><h3> 2. You're Not Fulfilled.</h3><p> Whether it&rsquo;s your job, your relationships, or your downtime, we all need to find meaning at some point in our day-to-day. When you&rsquo;re engaged and challenged, you&rsquo;re more likely to feel fulfilled. You don&rsquo;t need to save the world to feel good about what you do. But it doesn't hurt either. Start small: donate to a cause you care about, help a stranger, or simply call your mom and say \"thanks!\"</p><h3> 3. You Don't Make Time For The Good Stuff.</h3><p> Fun is as much of a priority as work, kids, and all the other things our parents and teachers told us. In fact, not prioritizing things that make you happy is one of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/the-surprising-benefits-of-wasting-time\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the Top 5 Life Regrets  </a>  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/the-surprising-benefits-of-wasting-time\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   .  </a> </u>  Read more  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/the-surprising-benefits-of-wasting-time\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 4.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> For the past decade, junior mining companies have outperformed senior miners at finding new mineral deposits and generating wealth for investors. </h3><p> <br/> These are among some of the findings released in a study conducted by resource company strategist MinEx Consulting, which analyzed the performance of explorers and producers operating in Canada between 1975 and 2014. What the consultancy firm found is that, in the last decade, junior companies were responsible for more than three quarters of all new mineral discoveries and were approximately 30 percent more effective than senior companies at generating wealth.</p><p> Ralph Aldis, portfolio manager of our two precious metals funds&mdash; the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=10977\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Precious Minerals Fund (UNWPX)  </a> </u>  and  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=10976\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Gold and Precious Metals Fund (USERX)  </u>  , </a>  which holds four stars overall from Morningstar, among 71 Equity Precious Metals funds as of 3/31/2015, based on risk-adjusted returns&mdash;agrees with the results of the study. In a March interview with  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=10978\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Gold Report  </u>  , </a>  he noted that junior gold producers &ldquo;have the flexibility to be able to adjust&rdquo; to varying commodity-price conditions.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the smaller, midsized companies that have a better handle on their operations,&rdquo; Ralph said.</p><p> A good example of such a small-cap miner would be Claude Resources Inc., which we own in both USERX and UNWPX. Claude, the only producer operating in Saskatchewan, Canada, managed to turn its operation around fairly quickly after netting a huge loss of $73 million in 2013. The company just reported a profit of $4.6 million in 2014, driven by &ldquo;record production performance,&rdquo; according to President and CEO Brian Skanderbeg. For the one-year period, the company is up a phenomenal 216 percent.</p><p> &ldquo;Claude has been around for a long time, but its new management understood that it had to change its mining method, which has made a big difference,&rdquo; Ralph said in The Gold Report.</p><p> Junior companies have increasingly played an essential exploratory role in Canada. Nearly 40 years ago, they were responsible for only 5 percent of all capital spent on exploration; by 2007, that amount had ballooned to more than 65 percent. Over the past decade, juniors have accounted for 54 percent of all spending on exploration in Canada.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/COMM-Importance-of-Junior-Mining-Companies-in-Canada-Has-Been-Rising-over-Time_04172015-lg.gif\" width=\"900\"/></p><p> As a result, major producers have steadily lost ground to the smaller players in terms of discovering new mineral deposits. In three of the previous 10 years, in fact&mdash;2009, 2010 and 2012&mdash;senior companies failed to make a single new discovery.</p><h3> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-04-17/COMM-In-the-Last-Decade-three-quarters-Percent-of-all-Mineral-Discoveries-in-Canada-Were-Made-by-Junior-Explorers_04172015-lg.gif\"/> <br/> Quality or Quantity? How about Both?</h3><p> Not all mineral deposits are created equal, of course. Some might be all a producer needs to be successful, whereas others aren&rsquo;t even worth the time and capital to develop.</p><p> You can think of a Tier 1 deposit as a &ldquo;company making&rdquo; mine&mdash;one that might yield up to 250,000 ounces of gold per year over its lifespan of 20 years or more. Some of these projects can easily be valued at over $1 billion.</p><p> A Tier 2 deposit is significant but not as profitable as a Tier 1, with a typical valuation of between $200 million and $1 billion.</p><p> Finally, a Tier 3 deposit is considered marginal, valued at anywhere between $0 and $200 million.</p><p> About 80 percent of the mining industry&rsquo;s wealth is generated from Tier 1 and Tier 2 projects. But such discoveries, as you might imagine, are muchrarer than Tier 3s. To give you an idea of just how rare they are, consider this: Every decade in Canada, the industry discovers on average 40 Tier 3 deposits, seven Tier 2 deposits&mdash;and only three Tier 1 deposits.</p><p> So how do the juniors stack up against the seniors when it comes to finding quality mines? In the table below, you can see that they&rsquo;re running slightly behind. In the past decade, juniors made 7.3 Tier 1 or 2 discoveries in Canada, compared to the seniors&rsquo; 8.7.</p><p> <strong>  Spend and Performance in Canada: 2005 &ndash; 2014 </strong></p> Exploration Spend in BillionsNumber of DiscoveriesTier 1 and 2 DiscoveriesEstimated Value of Discoveries, in BillionsValue/SpendSeniors$12.546%2124%8.754%$7.939%0.63Juniors$14.654%6676%7.346%$12.161%0.83Past performance does not guarantee future results.<br/>Source: MinEx Consulting, U.S. Global Investors<br/> <p> But&mdash;and this is a big &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;they handily beat the seniors when it came to the total number of discoveries. Of all the deposits found, over three quarters were made by junior miners.</p><p> As I said earlier, juniors spent more than the seniors on exploration during this timeframe ($14.6 billion compared to $12.5 billion), and their discoveries collectively had a much higher valuation ($12.1 billion compared to $7.9 billion). Accordingly, they were roughly 30 percent more effective than seniors at generating wealth for investors. Put another way, they had a greater &ldquo;bang for your buck.&rdquo;</p><h3> Small Cap, Big Opportunities</h3><p> This news bodes well for our two precious metals funds. Although they both invest in junior explorers and producers, the Gold and Precious Metals Fund also allocates assets to the large-cap, senior mining companies.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-04-17/COMM-Market-Capitalization-Breakdown-for-USGIs-Gold-Funds_04172015-lg.gif\"/></p><p> Not only that, but Canada is the top investment destination in both funds: 57 percent in USERX, 77 percent in UNWPX. Canadian mining companies have lately seen margin expansion because the majority of their costs are in the relatively weak Canadian dollar, yet they sell their commodities in the strong U.S. dollar.</p><p> According to MinEx, 19 percent of the world&rsquo;s high-quality Tier 1 and 2 mineral discoveries were made in Canada between 2005 and 2014. That&rsquo;s second only to the entire continent of Africa (25 percent). The country&rsquo;s mining industry also has an estimated value of $19 billion, or 21 percent of total valuation worldwide. At 0.77, Canada&rsquo;s value-spend ratio, or &ldquo;bang for your buck,&rdquo; was better than the global average of 0.67.</p><p> Explore U.S. Global Investors&rsquo; two gold equity funds:</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=10976\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Gold and Precious Metals Fund (USERX)  </a> </u>  is the first no-load gold mutual fund in the U.S. and seeks opportunity in gold mining, investing in proven gold-producing companies.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=10977\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The World Precious Minerals Fund (UNWPX)  </u>    </a> gives investors increased exposure to junior and intermediate mining companies involved in precious minerals such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium and diamonds for added growth potential.</p>",

    "link": "why-am-i-and-my-81-year-old-dad-so-excited-about-periscope",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "Over recent years, we've seen countless social platforms explode onto the scene in a blaze of publicity only to come crashing down to earth just as quickly (anyone remember the hype around Ello &ndash; perhaps &lsquo;Goodbye&rsquo; would have been more appropriate - last year?). The latest cool kid on the block is Twitter-owned<strong> Periscope, the new live-streaming app</strong>, which launched at the end of last month and is currently causing a huge stir. Yesterday morning I even heard The BBC&rsquo;s Tech Correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones manfully trying to overcome John Humphrys&rsquo; well-practiced cynicism on Radio 4&rsquo;s Today programme. Impressive publicity for a two-week old social network!<p> Although the idea is relatively simple &ndash; to allow your followers to live-stream whatever you are broadcasting and post comments in real time &ndash; the fact that Twitter has bought it for a reported $130 million shows that it means business. And the availability of streaming on a mobile device - plus the ability to record broadcasts for people to watch in their own time - seems to be a real game-changer.</p><p> Real-time marketing is moving at an extremely rapid pace, so Periscope (and its rival, Meerkat) is the next natural progression. <strong>  Businesses and individuals want the fastest means of communication possible. </strong> And you can't get much faster than this.</p><p> Twitter has now limited Meerkat's access to the platform (no surprise there!) and <strong>  Periscope allows users to pick and choose who can see their broadcasts. </strong> Similar to Facebook's 'Like' button, viewers can send &lsquo;heart&rsquo; icons to Periscopers. One big difference is that you can send as many hearts as you like. At first I found this a big cheesy but it actually works rather well as a way of letting the Periscoper know you&rsquo;re still enjoying the broadcast. It&rsquo;s the ultimate in constant, real-time feedback&hellip;a bit like &lsquo;The Worm&rsquo; during election debates.</p><p> I believe there's also plenty to be excited about from a B2B marketer's point of view. <strong>  Imagine being able to film the launch of a new service, a software demo or a PR event? Or perhaps a 'how to' broadcast, a live blog, interviews with industry thought leaders, a tour of a client&rsquo;s office or an interactive Q&amp;A session. </strong> The list of potential uses is endless. And I&rsquo;m convinced it has huge potential when applied to the B2B conference world.</p><p> On a personal note, I happened to fiddling around with Periscope over the Easter weekend and my 80-something Dad (you&rsquo;re far too kind, yes my parents did indeed have me extraordinarily late) asked what I was up to. I started to explain Periscope to him, realised I was making a pretty poor job of it, so instead gave him a quick demo. The effect was remarkable: instead of the John Humphrys-like bewilderment and cynicism that I&rsquo;d received on previous occasions when walking him through Twitter and Facebook, the minute he saw Periscope in action he &lsquo;got&rsquo; it.</p><p> <strong>  This aspect of Periscope: it&rsquo;s ability to engage and entertain at the broadcaster&rsquo;s end as well as that of the viewer, brings a whole new dimension to social media and the impact should not be under-estimated. </strong></p><p> So will Periscope turn out to be one of the few social platforms that manages to survive the initial tech sector hype and come out the other side as a genuinely useful mainstream service? And will this be one of the tiny minority of social networks that, like Twitter, will prove as useful to B2B marketers as to their B2C counterparts?</p><p> I believe the answer to both of these questions is an unequivocal yes. And far from being yet another example of &lsquo;Say Ello Wave goodbye&rsquo;, this time it will be a case of Up, Up, Up Periscope.</p>",

    "title": "Advisors: 3 Unexpected Sources for Content Ideas",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Content, content and more content! You&rsquo;d think that after a few years of content marketing you&rsquo;d run out of ideas. We&rsquo;ve found the opposite is true.</p><p> We actually have more ideas as every day passes. One of the tricks is to find sources of inspiration, and the more unexpected the source the better. Here are three to get you started.</p><h3> The magazine stand</h3><p> In an on-demand world, what&rsquo;s news today is often irrelevant tomorrow. Blogs, social networks and industry news sites can react to events and trends as they happen. Is it any wonder the future of print looks bleak?</p><p> Still, there are a handful magazines that have shown they have staying power, and marketing teams can learn a lot from them. Good Housekeeping, National Geographic, People and Sports Illustrated have all maintained paid circulation bases of more than three million subscribers. That&rsquo;s huge in a world that largely believes &ldquo;print is dead&rdquo; ( <u>  <a href=\"http://abcas3.auditedmedia.com/ecirc/magform.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   source  </a> </u> , paid circulation data for consumer magazines).</p><p> What are these magazines doing right? They each have a very specific audience and they write exactly what that audience wants to read. Because let&rsquo;s be honest, you&rsquo;re either the type of person who picks up Good Housekeeping or you&rsquo;re not.</p><p> They also write about evergreen topics that hit home. Content for print magazines is written months ahead of their publication date, and this content can&rsquo;t be stale by the time the latest issue hits the stands. Same goes for your marketing copy.</p><p> Finally, they use solid, informative headlines that aren&rsquo;t meant to mislead. Yes, we get how and why clickbait works. But it also annoys, because it&rsquo;s often misleading. Who among us strives to annoy our target audience? We didn&rsquo;t think so.</p><h3> Over (virtual) cocktails</h3><p> It makes sense to find inspiration in industry-specific LinkedIn and Facebook groups, or by following the big thought leaders on Twitter. But don&rsquo;t overlook your friends&rsquo; personal feeds. If your social network is wide, many of your online friends and acquaintances are bound to overlap with the audience you&rsquo;re trying to reach. And we know they&rsquo;re smart, savvy consumers.</p><p> Listen closely to what those friends are saying, and you&rsquo;ll pick up plenty of tips on what works and what to avoid in your marketing copy. For example, we&rsquo;ve learned that our friends are completely over people &ldquo;reaching out&rdquo; just to &ldquo;touch base.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t even get them started on &ldquo;leveraging&rdquo; that &ldquo;value-add.&rdquo; These are just a handful of phrases we try to avoid, now that we know their power to annoy.</p><p> And if social networking isn&rsquo;t your thing, listen over real cocktails. Or scotch. Or simply coffee. The same principles apply regardless of your drink of choice.</p><h3> Your front-line staff</h3><p> We all want to write copy that engages and entices our ideal customers or clients. That&rsquo;s the job, and we love what we do. But how often are we writing the copy we think our customers and clients want to hear? Have we checked by conducting extensive surveys or focus groups? These are both good ideas, by the way, but maybe a bit time consuming for every project.</p><p> Instead, have a conversation with your front-line staff. Your receptionists, call centre staff, sales team or anyone who has daily contact with customers. Ask your staff what questions they&rsquo;re hearing over and over again, and write content that answers those questions. Or put something together that addresses common complaints or highlights what your customers love about working with you.</p><p> Learn to look at employees in every department as potential sources of inspiration, and start writing.</p>",

    "title": "The Three Types of Independence You Must Cultivate with Clients",
    "link": "the-three-types-of-independence-you-must-cultivate-with-clients",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  You need to cultivate and exercise three kinds of independence from your clients: </strong></p><li> Intellectual independence . Sometimes, advisors and service providers forget that one of the reasons they are being employed is to provide independent perspectives. They want to be supportive of a client at every stage of the relationship, and sometimes this desire compromises intellectual integrity. If you&rsquo;re just starting the engagement, you may be afraid that you&rsquo;ll alienate your client by being too contrary, and if you&rsquo;re in the midst of a long-term relationship, your personal friendship can also get in the way. Great advisors always find an appropriate way to say what they think. This is harder than it sounds&mdash;some clients don&rsquo;t take bad news gracefully and blame the messenger.</li><li> Emotional independence . Every professional knows that working with clients can be an emotional roller coaster. Staying calm and centered while the client or the organization is &ldquo;hitting the walls&rdquo; can be difficult. Furthermore, since your livelihood or promotion prospects often hinge on the outcome of your work, you may start to hang on every nuance of mood or emotion that your client expresses. One client, referring to advice professionals in particular, said, &ldquo;You [as professionals] have a very difficult job. You have to always remain calm and levelheaded, even when the clients you&rsquo;re working with are being emotional and irrational. You have to be involved, yet detached at the same time.&rdquo; Strong professionals develop levels of self-esteem and self-confidence that enable them to be independent of the good (or bad) opinions of others, including their clients.</li><li> Financial independence . Advisors have to cultivate a mindset of independent wealth. The best advisors are highly paid, but they act as though they are not being paid and don&rsquo;t really need the money. If you are feeling financially needy and allow this need to intrude on your intellectual and emotional independence, you&rsquo;re lost. An anonymous advisor once counseled, &ldquo;Never act hungry&mdash;it makes people want to stop on the street and kick you.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Independence is essential for several important reasons. First, and most importantly, <strong>  it builds trust. </strong> Think about it: If you feel someone is just telling you what they think you want to hear, their advice is useless. Imagine you&rsquo;re shopping for a new suit or dress and the salesperson tells you that every one you try on looks fabulous on you. They have no credibility.</p><p> <strong>  So when you have this quality of tough love, it makes clients trust you and want to draw you into their inner circle. </strong></p><p> Secondly, If the client knows you are a straight shooter and will only tell them what you really believe, your words will always carry more weight. So for example, if you suggest a follow on project, your client&mdash;whether or not they want to do it&mdash;will at least believe you honestly think it&rsquo;s best and are not influenced by the money.</p><p> Finally, when you convey the gravitas and equilibrium that selfless independence gives you, it sets you apart from other run-of the mill sales people, account executives, and other professionals.</p><p> What independence dilemmas have you faced?</p>",

    "link": "provide-proof-to-attract-clients",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> An advisory firm I work with is in a competitive market in one of the most affluent areas in the country. One way they  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theclientdrivenpractice.com/strategic-differentiation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   differentiate  </a> </u>  themselves is in the thoroughness of their financial plans. When I first began working with them I asked what they do to win over prospects and convert them into clients. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;We give them a sample plan.&rdquo;</p><p> They explained that if a prospective client said they would be interviewing other advisors after my client walked them through their process, they would give the prospect a sample of one of their financial plans to bring home. They sent the prospects on their way with the recommendation that when they talk to other advisors, ask to see those advisors&rsquo; sample plans and compare them. Almost all the time the prospects returned, ready to become a client, reporting that while all the other advisors claimed to do financial planning as well, none of them could produce a sample of the plans they purportedly did for clients.</p><p> I was shocked. This was a market of experienced advisors competing for multi-million-dollar clients. Not exactly lightweights or newbies to the business. But there it was. Every advisor claimed to provide financial planning, but my client provided proof.</p><p> Proof is a tricky thing in the financial advisory world. You cannot prove we will do a good job because we don&rsquo;t actually know how things are going to work out. You don&rsquo;t know where the markets are going. You don&rsquo;t know how the tax laws will change. You don&rsquo;t know what the results are actually going to be. You can&rsquo;t use testimonials. Unlike the local gelato stand, there is no real practical way to give people a taste. But with it, you can attract clients and  <strong>  referrals. </strong></p><p> And there are some ways you can offer a form of &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that the experience of working with you will be the way you describe it. Here are a few I like to recommend:</p><h3> Give them a sample deliverable </h3><p> The advisor I mentioned above offers a sample financial plan. In it prospective clients can see all the areas that are addressed, the extent of the analyses, and how easy it is to understand. If you offer special analyses, like a Social Security report or a college financial aid analysis, offer one of those. Offering a sample of what comes out of your process can be a direct way to provide evidence of the kind of work you do.</p><h3> Show them a documented process </h3><p> I am frequently surprised when I talk with advisors who I believe are competent and do good work who cannot succinctly describe the process they guide clients through. The most frequent objection is that every client is different. While the results for each client, what their plan might recommend, and the advice they give to each client will be different because each client is unique, the process you take them through should be consistent. Document the steps and offer them to prospective clients. One of the exercises I do with almost all of my coaching clients is to develop a graphic representation of the advisors process. Documenting your process in a flowchart or with pictures makes it a lot easier for a client to remember. You do not need much text. Give each step a name and talk the client through it when you meet with them. When they bring it home, the pictures and titles will be enough to remind them of all the things you address at each stage of the process.</p><h3> Show them checklists and other tools you use </h3><p> One of my clients has an extensive checklist of items and issues that planners on the staff use when reviewing a client file to make sure that their plans are up to date. While they would never ask a client to complete such a complicated instrument, they thought it would be interesting to at least show a blank one to clients as a way of demonstrating how thorough they are when preparing financial plans. The clients were impressed. They made comments like &ldquo;I knew you were thorough but I never realized how much work you put into these things.&rdquo; It was a great way to prove how extensive their process is.</p><h3> Be prepared with some fun facts </h3><p> Having a few choice statistics or common myths at the ready can be a great way to prove your expertise. Show your prospective clients that you know things within your specialty that the average general practitioner does not know. We frequently insert them into  <u>  <a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   positioning statements  </a> </u> . The unexpected and the surprising are engaging. Starting them off with &ldquo;for example, did you know&hellip;&rdquo; can capture people&rsquo;s attention.</p><li> For example, did you know that rolling over your 403(b) into an IRA is often a mistake?</li><li> For example, did you know that moving money out of this employer&rsquo;s retirement plan can reduce your retirement health benefits?</li><li> For example, did you know that 65% of women who get divorced make one mistake that costs them tens of thousands of dollars of taxes over the 10 years following the divorce? </li><li> For example, did you know that 70% of retirement plans audited by the Department of Labor last year were found to be out of compliance?</li><li> For example, did you know that if a college athletic director wants your child on his team he can help you get a better offer from the financial aid office? <br/>  </li><h3> Client stories and case studies</h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stories  </a> </u>  are powerful for two reasons: We are wired to remember them a lot better than we can remember lists of benefits. And because they show the effect of what you do on someone&rsquo;s life &ndash; ideally, someone that your prospective client has empathy with. Rather than hoping that they can interpret an abstract benefit, a good story can help a client envision their own life being improved the same way. What makes stories powerful also makes them tricky from a compliance standpoint. Some advisors I have worked with have attempted to put together case studies that named (with their permission) the clients being profiled. The SEC struck them down as being testimonials even though they made no mention of the advisor or the services that were provided. I have had anonymized client stories rejected by compliance departments because describing what ultimately happened in the story was deemed to be promissory. (Converting the story to a hypothetical and stating what really happened as a hoped-for outcome was acceptable. The logic was twisted and bizarre, but that&rsquo;s the compliance game.) Case studies and stories have been extremely effective in many situations. But make sure you check with your compliance officer or department before using them.</p><h3> Provide Social Proof </h3><p> Social proof, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/27/social-proof-why-people-like-to-follow-the-crowd/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   the positive influence created when someone finds out that other are doing something  </u> </a> , is hard to come by in financial services. Except referrals, of course, which are the ultimate social proof. But one firm I spoke with had a brilliant way of creating it. They recruited prominent citizens in their city to serve on their client advisory board. Part of the role was to consent to begin included in the firm&rsquo;s public announcements about the board. Financial advisors, of course, cannot disclose the identities of their clients. With permission, however, they could promote the members of their advisory board. People in the community would often assume that if those high profile people were associated with the firm, the firm must be high quality. It helped them attract some ideal clients.  </p><h3> Designations and affiliations </h3><p> I list these last because they are the weakest kind of proof. And I say that as a Certified Financial Planner certificant. Professional designations and affiliations with organizations like NAPFA and the Garrett Planning Network say important things about you as a professional. But how they translate into specific benefits to a client are too indirect to be powerful marketing tools. If you are in competition with a single other advisor for a financial planning client and you are a CFP&acirc; professional and the other is not, it will give you an edge. But in a crowded field where many other advisors all have the same designation, it does not provide much leverage.</p><p> Telling people how they will be better off working with you because of your special expertise or unique process will help you attract clients in your target market. Providing some kind of proof that you can deliver on those promises can help make you much more persuasive.</p>",

Your heirs may not be able to find or access all of your digital assets if you don't include them in your estate plan.\"The article states that 87% of adults use the Internet and I can't speak for others, but I know that I have spend lots of money on songs and books that exist only in the Internet, accessible only with my password and personal information. Shouldn't these be considered assets and something that falls under the purview of estate planning?In the article, <a href=\"http://www.gpmlaw.com/People/James-Lamm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  James Lamm </u> ,</a> an estate planning and tax attorney at Gray Plant Mooty law firm in Minneapolis, Minn. said, \"Digital assets hold both financial and sentimental value to family and friends that should be addressed in the estate planning and administration process.\"<strong> Lamm recommends that estate planning include a thorough and rigorous review of identifying a person's digital properties and identifying which of them are \"valuable or significant.&rdquo;</strong>\"Additional obstacles with digital property that you don't have with traditional property are passwords, encryption, computer crime laws, and data privacy laws. Any one of them can make it practically impossible to do anything with the digital property unless you've planned ahead,\" Lamm said.Listing Web assets, passwords, and all online accounts is a tedious exercise, but if digital assets exist there, you need to consider them or they will disappear into the ether, when you, ahem, do the same.A necessary resource to assist you is the process is <u> an article in Estate Planning magazine from May 2013</u>, which provides a clear outline of what items need to be considered. These include consideration of your email information, social-networking site information, blogs you maintain, online financial sites, digital photos and more.Another resource is Lamm's website, <u> <a href=\"http://www.digitalpassing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  DigitalPassing.com </a></u>, where he provides great advice on the subject including explanations of the Terms of Services contracts from various online providers and how they may impact the ability for fiduciaries to access this information, even if they have the password information.He reports that<strong> laws are changing as more people and authorities recognize that digital assets are part of a person's estate.</strong>It's an area that is worth watching. The <u> <a href=\"http://community.ally.com/straight-talk/estate-planning-your-digital-assets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ally article </a></u> states that \"Lamm stresses that until the laws are changed, taking the steps to safeguard your digital assets isn't infallible. But it will make it easier to have your wishes followed if you put them in writing.\"Obviously I still have more work to do on my estate plan and with the consideration of digital assets, it's clear that what we know about estate planning is changing. Well at least, my estate plan will look a lot different from what I originally thought and because of my book and song collections, clearly unique and different from others.In her book, \"<u> <a href=\"http://peopletested.com/portfolio-items/whats-deal-estate-planning/?portfolioID=4544\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  What's the Deal with Estate Planning? </a></u>\" (published by People Tested Publications, which I have ownership in), Peggy Hoyt makes clear that, \"A primary goal of estate planning should be to create a plan that works-for you and your family. No two families are alike and no two plans will ever be alike.\"So before I consider my estate plan complete, I'll have to consider those One Direction songs. Just don't make me listen to them.",

    "content": "<p> Procurious is gathering 40 of the brightest, most-influential figures across procurement, technology, and social media for the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.procurious.com/group/big-ideas-summit-2015-digital-delegates/activity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Big Ideas Summit  </a> </u>  on 30 April.</p><p> We quizzed  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.procurious.com/user/timothy-tim-hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tim Hughes  </a> </u> , social media extraordinaire and Go to Market in the UK for Oracle&rsquo;s Cloud Accounting and Procurement solutions on the future of the sharing economy, procurement, and technology. You can follow Tim  <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Timothy_Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @Timothy_Hughes  </a> </u>  on Twitter.</p><p> <strong>  Procurious asks: In your Twitter bio you call yourself a pioneer of Social Selling &ndash; could you distil it for the uninitiated? </strong></p><p> Tim answers: It&rsquo;s not a self proclaimed title, I&rsquo;ve been called it many times.  My background is 27 years in sales, so what I do (always) is try and push the Social Selling debate forward.  How can I find new ways of using social and technology to forward an organisations sales strategy.  At the end of the day, it is all about using Social Selling to enable a sales person over achieve their quota quicker.</p><p> Last year I was mentioned in Forbes as one of the Top 100 Global Social Sellers, this year an Influence Marketing company, Onalytica, came up with a list which positioned me as the number 2 most Influential Social Seller Worldwide.  The only person from the UK on that list.</p><p> My Twitter  <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Timothy_Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @Timothy_Hughes  </a> </u>  has over 100,000 followers and my Blog  <u>  <a href=\"https://timothyhughesuk.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   https://timothyhughesuk.wordpress.com/  </a> </u>  I&rsquo;m told is a &ldquo;must read&rdquo; for people involved in Social Selling as it generates so many new ideas and debate.  My most recent blog &ldquo;Using Twitter to Make C-Level Meetings&rdquo; went viral.  Something I am very grateful for.</p><p> <strong>  Procurious: Mastering social selling &ndash; if you were to promote best practice, what would be your top 5 tips? </strong></p><p> Tim: On my blog I provide written materials and webcasts where I talk about the 5 Pillars of Social Selling to offer organisations a strategy.  In terms of day to day things you can do, here are 5 suggestions.</p><li> People need to have a &ldquo;Buyer Centric Profile&rdquo; on LinkedIn.</li><li> People need to Identify their customers and Influencers.</li><li> Listen.</li><li> Build Relationships and Engage.  Don&rsquo;t Spam!</li><li> Measure. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Procurious: Innovation in the social space &ndash; your thoughts on the likes of Periscope and Meerkat. Will they stick around, what do they offer social storytellers etc. </strong></p><p> Tim: I&rsquo;ve not used them myself, but I&rsquo;m sure they can.  You always need to go to where your audience is more comfortable.  With C-Level people now being on Twitter and LinkedIn, they is no reason, why a brand or a sales person does not stream video.  For example, a user conference, demonstration or webinar.  Video is becoming more and more a medium that people are comfortable with.  I&rsquo;m currently working with a sales person to use video for demand generation as inmails on LinkedIn and emails don&rsquo;t get the right traction.</p><p> The Oxford and Cambridge, Boat Race last weekend used Snapchat, so why not look at new ways to reach your audience or even reach a new audience.</p><p> <strong>  Procurious: What else is disrupting the online, social space right now? (And how could this tie into procurement) </strong></p><p> Tim: SMACT (Social, Mobile, Analytics (Big Data), Cloud, Internet of Things) are the main disrupters I see right now.  People except to come to work and access systems the way they do at home, via mobile and for them to have the same &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; as Facebook.  This is causing major disruption to people that have IT systems that don&rsquo;t support this.  To that end, we are seeing that IT departments just cannot keep up because of the speed of innovation, that is where they are pro-actively using public cloud to support the business.</p><p> People are moving away from text to visual content.  Photo and video.  Instagram is the big platform for people and brands right now.  At a recent procurement event I attended somebody said they couldn&rsquo;t see how Instagram was relevant and I said, why send out an RFP, why you could post a photo on Instagram and say &ldquo;who can supply me one of these?&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  Procurious: Gamification &ndash; is it important/how can it be used to effectively breed user loyalty? </strong></p><p> Tim: Gamification should not be a &ldquo;shoot from the hip&rdquo; solution.  Different people react to Gamification in different ways.  While many of us are naturally competitive, often people will just &ldquo;take our bat and ball and go home&rdquo;.  It has been used for years by Tesco (Club Card) and Sainsbury (Nectar) to enable them to understand customer behavior.  I&rsquo;ve used it in the sales environment for cold calling days, I&rsquo;ve also used it for Demand Generation via social media (See my blog for details).</p><p> <strong>  Procurious: Why should we be encouraging procurement professionals to face their fears and get on social networks? </strong></p><p> Tim: 20 years ago us sales people were able to talk to who we liked in an organisation.  Then people introduced all kinds of technology, like voice mail to stop us getting to company executives.</p><p> I have a friend who last week made 12 appointments with C-Level people through Twitter.  A number of us think it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; again.  If executives (in any department) do use social media, how will they understand it?  There was a theory it would just go away.  It won&rsquo;t.  The argument around social media use in business and the ROI of social media was won two years ago.  We use social media internally, it gives us Competitive Advantage and has increased employee efficiency by 25 per cent.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p><p> <strong>  Procurious: Can you recommend some actions to help social-networking newbies spread and grow their online influence? </strong></p><p> Tim: The first thing when you get online is to breath. You don&rsquo;t have to be somebody you are not, just be yourself.  If you are using social media just to get a hang of it, then just do, post photos of what interests you; sailing, cars, book reading.  If you want to grow your influence then be interesting, add value and engage.  Find influencers and engage with them.  </p><p> <strong>  And finally, look forward to 2030. How will the social landscape have changed, what&rsquo;s your Big idea for social? </strong></p><p> Tim: Change will accelerate, as mobiles get faster, can hold more data and the battery live is longer.  Wearables will move from watches and bracelets to be woven into the fabric of your clothing.  Through the Internet of Things (IOT) everything will be connected to the internet and will collect data.  The amount of data we store will get bigger and bigger.  The decision making from this data will revolutionize  society and the way we think and act.  This is already being used by Netflix and dating sites.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.procurious.com/blog-content/2015/04/socialinfo.jpeg\"/></p><p> The Sharing Economy will move from the edges to be the &ldquo;norm&rdquo; with 25 per cent of the NASDAQ having disappeared already, more company will go as new entrants will take their place.  Uber has no taxis, AirBnB has no rooms.  The first question VCs ask start ups now is &ldquo;What Industry will you Kill?&rdquo;.</p><p> But this will all be surpassed by Artificial Intelligence (AI), while sensors are being seen as the fourth wave of the Industrial Revolution, AI is the 5th.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.procurious.com/blog-content/2015/04/revo3.jpg\"/></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Michael Luchies </u> 64% of Millennials see making the world a better place a priority in their work and business according to an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2014/01/13/what-millennials-want-in-the-workplace-and-why-you-should-start-giving-it-to-them/\" target=\"_blank\">   Intelligence Group  </a> </u>  study. This desire to change the world has materialized in several ways, one of those being the rise of social ventures and enterprises.Social enterprise defined by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Enterprise UK  </a> </u> : &ldquo;Social enterprises are businesses trading for social and environmental purposes. Many commercial businesses would consider themselves to have social objectives, but social enterprises are distinctive because their social and/or environmental purpose is absolutely central to what they do &mdash; their profits are reinvested to sustain and further their mission for positive change.&rdquo;Starting a business with a philanthropic goal is more than just a trend &mdash; it&rsquo;s almost becoming a standard with startups, but not everyone has jumped on board. Corporate contributions to charities have actually  <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/08/corporations_don_t_give_to_charity_why_the_most_profitable_companies_are.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  decreased </a>  over the past 30 years, as more focus has been placed on profits.  While small businesses contribute an average of  <u>  <a href=\"https://philanthropy.com/article/Most-Small-Companies-Make/225215\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   6 percent  </a> </u>  of their profits to charity, corporations average under 1 percent.</p><h3> Social Venture Examples</h3><u> <a href=\"http://under30ceo.com/entrepreneurial-fabric-interview-kevin-lavelle-mizzen-main/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Kevin Lavelle </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"https://www.mizzenandmain.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mizzen+Main </a></u> &ndash; Mizzen+Main is a high-end clothing company that uses performance fabrics in traditional menswear. From the start of the company, Kevin wanted to serve a purpose greater than himself. Mizzen+Main features stories of military veterans on their blog, gives a percentage of profits to foundations supporting veterans, donates shirts to active military and veterans, and provides job opportunities and internships to veterans.<u> <a href=\"http://under30ceo.com/entrecelebrity-interview-spirithoods-founder-alexander-mendeluk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Alexander Mendeluk </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"https://www.spirithoods.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SpiritHoods </a></u> &ndash; The faux fur hood maker SpiritHoods gives back 10% of profits to help protect endangered animals.<u> <a href=\"http://under30ceo.com/not-if-but-when-interview-with-bangs-shoes-hannah-davis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hannah Davis </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.bangsshoes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BANGS Shoes </a></u> &ndash; BANGS shoes donates, or as they put it, &ldquo;invests,&rdquo; 20% of their net profits to help entrepreneurs, often impoverished, start businesses through nonprofit Kiva.<h3> What if Every Business was a Social Venture?</h3>Note: For the sake of this discussion, we&rsquo;ll use the assumption that social ventures give 10% of net profits to a designated charity, an internal charity, or a group of charities.If every business was a social venture, nonprofits would be able to focus more on their mission and operations instead of fundraising. Nonprofit budgets would expand significantly, employment in the nonprofit sector would rise, and poverty in impacted areas would decrease.Nonprofit advertising and marketing would shift from individual donors to the corporations seeking to find charities to partner with.Unemployment would decrease and salaries for nonprofit employees, and competition for those jobs would increase.For corporations, greed would still play a large role. We would see many of these corporations start internal non-profits and focus on &ldquo;causes&rdquo; that would impact their bottom line in the present or future. Not all of this would be bad, as investments in the community and even within their own industry would benefit more than just their business, but many worthy charities outside of their interests would be ignored.Instead of just wanting to support a business because they have a social focus, that focus and the charities they support would become important to consumers. Consumers would actively seek out companies and products that support causes they care about more actively than they do now.As with any massive change, there&rsquo;s good and bad. Although there would be a lot of difficult changes to manage and both the corporate and nonprofit sector would need to change and innovate, the positive impact on the world would be incredible. The billions of additional dollars given to social causes would improve the economy and the lives of everyone.<h3> My only question is, what are we waiting for?</h3>The 10% of donated profits would make an impact far beyond what that money would do for the corporations. It may slow innovation and business growth, but the emphasis on profits and lean practices would still be significant.Now it&rsquo;s your turn. What&rsquo;s your take? What would happen if all businesses became social ventures, giving at least 10% of net profits to a social cause?",

    "content": "<p> For me, becoming an FBI agent was Plan B.</p><p> Growing up on a cattle ranch in the middle of Wyoming, I yearned for a life of excitement. I graduated with a Business Degree because I thought it would open doors in the world of fast-moving finance. It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to find the routine of an office job terribly boring&mdash;there was no adventure, no excitement, no real challenges to keep my mind alert and creative. </p><p> After a bit of research, I decided that the U.S. Foreign Service was the answer to my dilemma. Lots of travel to exotic lands and immersion in foreign cultures&mdash;it sounded like my dream job. I carefully ticked off all the requirements needed to apply, filled out a background form and sent off my application.</p><p> I did very well on the personality test, but I failed miserably on the language aptitude test so my application was thrown out. </p><p> The word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; hung over my head: I did not get into the Foreign Service. I didn&rsquo;t know where to go or what to do next.</p><p> Yet, growing up on a cattle ranch had instilled in me a strong sense of persistence and determination. If something didn&rsquo;t work out right the first time, Plan B was quickly called into action. If cattle needed to be fed or watered (which usually meant life or death for them) I would keep at it until I found a way to move forward and get the job done, no matter how long it took.</p><p> After failing the Foreign Service, I realized that I needed to put Plan B into action in my own life and refocus on what other options were out there for me. I wasn&rsquo;t going to wallow in self-pity. Since I had already researched U.S. Government jobs, I knew I also qualified for the FBI. I submitted the application. Six months later, I was in the FBI New Agents Training Academy at Quantico, VA. </p><p> I have never looked back.   </p><p> Successful people are those who are good at Plan B. Why? Because by trying and failing, we learn what doesn&rsquo;t work&mdash;and with that comes the knowledge we need to understand what will work. </p><h3> 1. Find Gratitude And Redefine &ldquo;Failure&rdquo;</h3><p> Succesful people, from whatever organization or walk of life, tend to repeatedly cite one specific personal failure when explaining their success. Usually, the failure was one that was traumatic and difficult to transcend. Filled with desperation, they felt as though they&rsquo;d hit rock bottom. </p><p> As Warren Bennis said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if that moment the iron entered their soul; that moment created the resilience that leaders need.&rdquo;</p><p> Too often, &ldquo;success&rdquo; is simply mediocrity. It&rsquo;s where we stop on our way to being the person we really wanted to be. We are smart, talented, and full of untapped potential&mdash;and too afraid to move into the discomfort of the unknown and push our boundaries. </p><p> Why? </p><li> <strong>  We&rsquo;re afraid of failure.  </strong></li><li> We&rsquo;ve not learned what will work, and what won&rsquo;t.</li><li> We have no Plan B to implement what we&rsquo;ve learned. <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Become Your Own Hero</h3><p> The key is to not linger too long on anything that clearly isn&rsquo;t working. This means failing frequently. </p><p> Only by trying many different things will you find the one way that points to the best future. But when you do, you become your own hero!</p><p> Repeated failure will build mental toughness and show you with absolute clarity how you must move forward if you are to succeed. It&rsquo;s actually a curse to have everything go right when you first start out because you will start to believe you have the golden touch . . . and when you do inevitably fail, you&rsquo;ll be demoralized.</p><h3> 3. Lose The Shame</h3><p> We are afraid of failure because, essentially, we have a fear of shame. </p><p> Most of us are motivated to avoid failing because we cannot manage the basic emotions of disappointment or frustration that may emerge; instead, we feel deep shame that we are imperfect&mdash;and vulnerable. </p><p> Failure offers the gift of bringing priorities into focus. If something doesn&rsquo;t hold value for you, then giving up and moving on to something different does no more than prick your pride. </p><p> If, however, you risk losing something important, you will work hard and do what it takes to tackle the obstacle that stands between you and success.</p><p> <strong>  When has Plan B inspired your success? </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I feel confirmation in life when I&rsquo;m asked to teach what I most need to learn. For some reason, it&rsquo;s reassuring to me to know that the universe is gently nudging me to become my best self, even when it feels far outside my comfort zone. Of course, that&rsquo;s the way growth works after all; in order to become stronger we have to break down our current way of doing things so we can adapt. It may not feel good in the process, but our perception of what&rsquo;s happening can not only make a difference in how much we enjoy the journey, but also how much return we get on our investment.</p><p> A last minute change to my already chaotic travel and speaking schedule this week would not only have me doing small breakouts for some of the top thought leaders in the world but now also adding a keynote session for the entire group just hours after I arrived. When I was asked to make the adjustment, I of course used humor as I processed what I would be doing: &ldquo;You know, this goes against everything I teach, right?&rdquo;</p><p> Perhaps the most ironic part was that the topic for the conference I will be presenting for is Moonshot Thinking. I realized in that moment that my challenge now would not only be to help restore the energy of some of the greatest thinkers in the world, but also to challenge my own ability to think outside the box. To take a direct quote from the chair of the program, a Moonshot Thinker is one who &ldquo;invests the intellectual energy to contemplate new thoughts and new ways of looking at seemingly impossible problems.&rdquo; Perhaps in the past I&rsquo;d have considered doing 6 meetings in 5 days in 3 cities and multiple time zones as impossible, especially with an audience of this caliber. But today I see it as an opportunity to step up to the plate and become a Moonshot Thinker myself.</p><p> Last week as I prepared I considered the way the brain is hardwired to operate and how we must retrain the brain in order to facilitate Moonshot Thinking. At the time I didn&rsquo;t realize I would be using my own concepts to change my own thought patterns, as I get ready to hit the big stage early tomorrow morning. I thought I would share these concepts with you now, and ask for your insight as to how you think we need to change our mental frameworks in order to think in bigger ways. And not only to expand our mental energy capacity, but also to do so in a way that is sustainable over time. Anyway can show up in extraordinary ways every now and then, but how do we do so without using up our most valuable energy resources?</p><h3> My Top 10 Moonshot Mindset Shifts <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1) Your brain says: Money means success. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: Come up with your own definition of success, and visualize it regularly. Daily. See what it looks like, feel what it feels like, hear what it sounds like. Embrace being there already, and act as if.</p><p> <strong>  2) Your brain says: When you&rsquo;re successful you&rsquo;ll be happy. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: We now know the formula is broken, as studies show once you&rsquo;re happy, then you&rsquo;ll be more successful. Moonshot thinkers invest time appreciating what they have and use the power of gratitude to enhance cognitive performance rather than speeding along to the next item on the to-do list.</p><p> <strong>  3) Your brain says: Check email immediately so you know what you&rsquo;re dealing with. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: In order to optimize brain performance, you must first nourish your mind with positivity and motivation. Avoid diving into stress mode first thing in the morning by investing in your mental energy tank as soon as possible.</p><p> <strong>  4) Your brain says: All or nothing. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: Practice progress over perfection so that you can course correct along the way. Constant, consistent improvements create the most fabulous products and programs.</p><p> <strong>  5) Your brain says: Don&rsquo;t take it personally. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: People are energy, and energy is contagious so surround yourself with people who are positive and proactive. Rationally optimistic.</p><p> <strong>  6) Your brain says: What if? </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: What if you don&rsquo;t? Be quick to identify the benefits of every experience, and avoid obsessing about challenges and obstacles. Every course correction is an opportunity to reflect on whether or not you&rsquo;re acting in alignment with your most important values and goals.</p><p> <strong>  7) Your brain says: Work should feel like work. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: Recognize the incredible value of play, fun and humor at work. Adding playfulness and enjoyment not only boosts creativity and intuition, it also decreases the toxic stress response in the brain and body, enhancing resilience and sustainability.</p><p> <strong>  8) Your brain says: You can rest when you&rsquo;re dead. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: You can&rsquo;t help anyone else without putting your oxygen mask on first. Realize that by failing to take care of your personal energy you decrease the value of what you bring to your work, your family, and your experience of life as a whole. No one ever put on their tombstone: he was the first to get to work and the last to leave.</p><p> <strong>  9) Your brain says: You shouldda, wouldda, couldda ________. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: The undisciplined mind spends about 40% of the time reliving the past and about 50% worrying about the future, which leaves only about 10% of the time to be in the present moment. Yet, the present moment is where the magic happens. Be disciplined about training your brain to be single task focused in the present moment when things matter.</p><p> <strong>  10) Your brain says: Change is too hard. Stay where things are comfortable. </strong> <br/> Moonshot shift: Life is always changing. We&rsquo;re either growing or we&rsquo;re dying; nothing stays the same.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When you think of Lady Gaga, what comes to mind? Probably her musical talent (six Grammy awards so far), perhaps her outrageous wardrobe (meat dress, anyone?), maybe her unusual antics (the infamous awards show entrance in a giant egg). Only 28 years old and she has certainly made a name for herself.</p><p> But as Jackie Huba outlines in her book,Monster Loyalty: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Loyalty-Turns-Followers-Fanatics/dp/1591846501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429817838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=How+Lady+Gaga+Turns+Followers+Into+Fanatics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   How Lady Gaga Turns Followers Into Fanatics  </u> </a> , there&rsquo;s much more to Lady Gaga than meets the eye. In fact, she proves an excellent case study in authenticity, service, and powerful leadership.</p><p> Unfamiliar with the book when I picked it up, I had few expectations. I merely hoped to get a bit of insight into why Gaga does what she does, but the introduction set my aim higher: &ldquo;Lady Gaga&rsquo;s business sense impresses me,&rdquo; writes Huba, &ldquo;but her passion for changing the world for the better through any means possible is what truly inspired me to study her.&rdquo; Page after page, Huba shows how Lady Gaga takes extraordinary measures to make a difference to the causes and people that matter most to her.</p><h3> A few lessons in uncommon leadership from Lady Gaga:</h3><li> Focus on those who matter most. Have you ever heard hurtful criticism from someone you don&rsquo;t even know &ndash; or maybe know and don&rsquo;t respect &ndash; and let it bother you? Let it go. You&rsquo;ll never please everyone, especially if you&rsquo;re challenging the status quo. Focus on your mission, values, and those who matter most.</li><li> Start with why. Huba shows how  <a href=\"http://www.iowabiz.com/2014/10/whats-your-purpose-insights-from-simon-sineks-book-start-with-why.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Simon Sinek </a> &rsquo;s &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo; approach (start with why, then how, then what) applies to Lady Gaga&rsquo;s work, and how we can bring it into our own work as well. Gaga&rsquo;s why? &ldquo;To transform the culture to create a kinder, braver world where everyone is valued.&rdquo; Her why shines through everything she does, from her songs to her interviews to her Born This Way Foundation that empowers youth to build confidence and end bullying. </li><li> Go big or go home. &ldquo;No one talks about products or companies that are just average,&rdquo; Huba shares. &ldquo;The way Gaga sees it, whatever you are working on, you should blow it out.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t let the fear of what others might say keep you from honoring your authenticity. Playing small or hiding your light serves no one. <br/>  </li><p> Lady Gaga also reminds us of a key principle in leadership: it&rsquo;s not about you. As it turns out, the meat dress, as well as her other attention-grabbing &ldquo;stunts,&rdquo; involve purposeful action: to support a cause, speak out against an injustice, or give a voice to those who might not otherwise be heard.</p><p> While you may not agree with nor want to attract the same kind of attention as Lady Gaga, her ability to connect deeply with and inspire her most engaged fans offers terrific leadership insight. &ldquo;What I do [in my concerts],&rdquo; she explained to MTV, &ldquo;is, in essence, create an atmosphere for my fans where they don&rsquo;t leave loving me, they leave loving themselves.&rdquo;</p><p> Consider how you can more powerfully focus on those who matter most, start with why, and go big &ndash; all in service of a brighter, stronger world. Because remember: regardless of your title, fame, or the number of Grammys on your shelf, your leadership is not about you.</p>",

    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> Bryce owns a successful but small company that sells water testing supplies.  His company manufactures them and sells these supplies through their website to chemists in industrial applications.</p><p> I spoke with Bryce recently about better marketing his products online, and he was understandably proud to tell me this:</p><p> &ldquo;Most of our products are of a distinctive, almost unique, style.  They are one-of-a-kind, and no other company sells exactly the same products we do. The company was formed when my father invented these types of devices.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Yet, his competitors selling seemingly inferior products are 10x, 15x, 20x the size of his company. How could this be? </strong></p><p> I speak with a lot of manufacturing founders and CEOs like Bryce that sell unique items in niche markets, and most tell me similar stories to Bryce&rsquo;s.  Often, someone affiliated with the company invented a product or manufacturing technique that makes the product unique &mdash; unlike anything else in the market.  That innovation improves the product significantly.</p><p> <strong>  But in the eyes of your potential customer that&rsquo;s just starting to search for solutions to a situation they face, does that innovation or difference matter? </strong></p><p> What you have to understand is that even though no other product is exactly the same as yours, there are several products that accomplish the same things for a customer.  Your prospective customer might not need to buy a product to solve their issue, even though it may solve it.  There are other solutions in that consideration set, too.</p><p> <strong>  The real question becomes this: are you helping your competitor by being too product focused and not customer focused? </strong></p><p> In Bryce&rsquo;s case, people are buying water testing kits. His product may do it differently and better, but does an early stage prospect who is looking to buy products like his know that? When they search Google and they find Bryce&rsquo;s company website, will it  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/online-marketing-for-industrial-manufacturing-companies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contain the information that furthers a prospect&rsquo;s knowledge  </a> </u> ?  Does the website  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/case-study-targeted-manufacturing-blog-wins-customers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   inspire confidence by helping a person solve their unique challenge  </a> </u>  with education?  Or does Bryce&rsquo;s website go right for the sales pitch without providing proper background?</p><p> It&rsquo;s understandable, then, why a buyer might choose a less superior product over your unique, one-of-a-kind product.</p><p> <strong>  Ask yourself this question: do the people that reach out to your sales reps understand as much about your product or your industry as you do? </strong>  The mistake most manufacturing CEOs, salespeople and product managers make is that they think their prospects know as much about the industry as they do, and it shows on their websites.</p><p> In Bryce&rsquo;s situation, a chemist might know a lot about chemistry, but they may have been testing water samples for years using the same product. They get mostly reliable results, but changing products introduces uncertainty.  Will Bryce&rsquo;s company website address that uncertainty and other pushbacks that might come up in order to further the sale?</p><p> When your ideal customer  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/manufacturing-company-blog-more-prospects/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   searches the internet for information  </a> </u>  on a general product type, the positioning of your product may be so specific that your company gets overlooked.  Do you want to help your prospects overlook your company by not providing valuable information they can use? Will buyers realize the benefits of your product if your messaging is specific or technical?</p><p> You have to remember that though people buying from you may be engineers or technically sophisticated people, they don&rsquo;t have the same level of understanding about your products or even the industry as you do.  If you share specific details and product pitches too early, you&rsquo;ll frighten them off.</p><p> Some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.carolemahoney.com/strategic-sales-marketing-coach\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sales sherpa friends  </a> </u>  of mine might call pitching the product too soon &ldquo;asking for a marriage proposal before you date.&rdquo;</p><p> What if you had a rash and you didn&rsquo;t know what it was?  You might Google it, and find the WebMD website.  You might look for similar rashes and read about them. You compare it to yours, and notice some similarities. The next thing you know, you&rsquo;re looking for a way to contact a doctor. When you started your research, though, you weren&rsquo;t looking for a doctor.</p><p> <strong>  Why treat your website any different? </strong>   When you write your website, consider the early stage buyer that has a problem.  They have a choice to do nothing at all, or even buy a completely different technology/product than yours.  Your website has to look and read as if you know the situation your buyer is in if you want more leads and customers.  The statements you make on your website need to answer the questions you get from prospects and relate to them on their level.  Shouldn&rsquo;t your company website say things that resonate with your ideal customer, not what resonates with company product managers, engineers or managers?</p><p> So if your company homepage has a large photo of company executives welcoming a new staff member, or an incredibly technical description of your product, or an overwhelming amount of information, maybe it&rsquo;s time to re-think it?</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/smart-marketing-template_3.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

    "link": "would-you-go-to-a-doctor-who-didnt-take-the-hippocratic-oath",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Most people are familiar with the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath\" target=\"_blank\">   Hippocratic Oath  </a> </u> : a sworn oath taken by physicians requiring them to uphold ethical standards. The Oath begins with the Latin words  Primum non nocere , which translate as <strong>  &ldquo;First, do no harm.&rdquo; </strong> It&rsquo;s quite comforting to know that the person you entrust with good health has your best interests at heart.But what about your financial health? Is there a similar oath for financial advisors requiring them to &ldquo;do no harm&rdquo; when assisting clients? As you might expect, there is no simple answer&mdash;which is precisely why President Obama&rsquo;s announcement that advisors would soon be required to meet a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionaleducation/11/suitability-fiduciary-standards.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fiduciary standard  </a> </u>  has been making  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3438433/investors-pensions/obama-sides-with-investors-on-401k-fiduciary-standard-fees.html#.VTGDc0sngmY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   headlines  </a> </u> .Here&rsquo;s the issue: an investment advisor who pledges a fiduciary duty to you must adhere to very stringent standards ensuring that, at all times,  your  best interests are paramount. But many providers&mdash;bankers, brokers, insurance agents and others&mdash; choose a less stringent path by serving in a more transactional capacity. Brokers are held to a lower standard called &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; when offering products. As well, there are dually registered brokers who are self-described as  <u>  <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fee-only-vs-fee-based-140034733.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fee-based  </a> </u> , and who benefit from two revenue streams: fees from you, and commissions from product providers. It&rsquo;s not difficult to jump to the conclusion that the lure of commissions may easily sway a broker from &ldquo;the client&rsquo;s best interest&rdquo; toward interest in his or her bottom line.In this recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/your-money/fiduciary-duty-rule-would-protect-consumers-and-target-investment-brokers.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   New York Times article  </a> </u> , David Certner, AARP&rsquo;s legislative counsel, stated, &ldquo;We think all advice should be subject to a fiduciary standard.&rdquo;  At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kleinadvisors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Klein Financial Advisors  </a> </u> , we couldn&rsquo;t agree more. While the pending legislation would impose a &ldquo;fiduciary duty&rdquo; on every investment professional, we are proud to say we&rsquo;re already there. Here are the top reasons why we have always been committed to fee-only planning and putting our clients&rsquo; best interests above our own: <strong>  Offering strictly objective advice is aligned with our evidence-based investment strategy. </strong> Evidence clearly shows that, over time, markets are relatively efficient and can help build and sustain wealth. Tactical attempts to identify and exploit marketing inefficiencies or deficiencies can create friction against the returns to which investors are entitled, through transaction costs and taxes. Esoterically, trading in markets tends to be a zero-sum game. We believe a similar equation applies to our successful relationship with you: by taking a holistic approach to your wealth, we focus on making the most of your family&rsquo;s wealth. <strong>  As a fiduciary advisor, we are confident that we fulfill our core value: integrity. </strong> Our goal is to create relationships that are more profitable for our clients than for us. Even as large corporations offer cheap, internet-driven &ldquo;robo-platforms,&rdquo; we are confident that our personalized advice&mdash;and our evidence-based service model&mdash;is the optimal solution for you and, in turn, for us.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Newcomers to the world of social finance &ndash; whether they be tech entrepreneurs or non-financial professionals &ndash; are often surprised by the apparent willingness of analysts and traders to share their ideas with other online community members. </strong></p><p> They're skeptical because they can't understand why sophisticated investors would trust the input of someone else who'd be willing to share their best ideas without being compensated. The more cynical of these onlookers see the investing world as inhabited by two categories of potential scoundrels: </p><li> <p>  rumor-mongers, who pedal in gossip, in order to rally unsuspecting investors behind their long or short positions (more about this group in a moment); and  </p></li><li> <p>  legitimate investors, who are more than happy to \"talk their book,\" in order to enlist the support of others, encouraging them to join their side of the trade. </p></li><p> The sense of puzzlement expressed by observers of online finance is understandable. The tumultuous financial events of the last decade left many individual investors feeling guarded. It comes as a surprise to these individuals when \"sophisticated\" investors appear willing to entrust others with their ideas.</p><p> I entered the financial profession during the early-1990s. The market professionals I worked with carefully guarded the insights and information they considered to be proprietary. The recent popularity of financial websites based on collaboration and sharing therefore seemed surprising to me &ndash; at least, initially.</p><h3> From Wikis to Crowdsourcing</h3><p> <br/> While financial firms still keep tight wraps on their processes and systems, many traders now appear surprisingly willing to loosen those restrictions, when it comes to sharing content, such as financial forecasts and investment analysis. </p><p> Open-sourced approaches to finance became popular in the years immediately preceding the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis. Several collaborative investing applications, such as Wikinvest, began to emerge at that time.  </p><p> One new startup &ndash; a New York-based wiki-type platform called Thinknum &ndash; \"allows users to share and collaborate on financial models without requiring them to email complex spreadsheets,\" according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/online-tool-for-young-bankers-raises-1-million-in-funding/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   DealBook  </a> </u> .</p><p> It wasn't until the Financial Crisis began to ease that investor crowdsouricng reached its full stride. The traders who post their ideas and projections on StockTwits, Estimize, SumZero, and Harvest are willing to share ideas &ndash; when the act of sharing serves their own long-term interests. </p><p> Stock analysts, traders, and investors didn't readily embrace the online sharing ethos, observes Leigh Drogen, the CEO of Estimize.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.leighdrogen.com/finance-people-dont-have-pseudonyms-and-other-musings-on-identity-in-social-finance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Drogen, a veteran of StockTwits, recalls  </a> </u>  how he \"fought so hard during [his] years at StockTwits to get people to accept the fact that guys ... were providing amazing information.\"</p><p> Drogen and his colleagues had to overcome the tainted reputation of the Yahoo Message Boards as \"a free for all garbage pile of pump and dump and rumors.\" As he notes, \"people just remembered Yahoo Finance message boards and didn&rsquo;t believe it was possible to get good info from someone without a real name attached.\" </p><h3> Open-Sourced Development as a Hacker Tradition</h3><p> <br/> The dichotomy between the proprietary culture of old-school traders on Wall Street, and the free-wheeling openness more recently displayed by online stock commentators, reminds me of similar contrasts observed in the world of technology.</p><p> Whereas the founders of Microsoft and Apple carefully guarded their software innovations, the developers of open-source software adopted a different approach.</p><p> In his recent book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/147670869X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=147670869X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwbrea08-20&amp;linkId=ENLLKXKYKS7ITGQZ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Innovators  </a> </u> , author Walter Isaacson describes the work of Linus Torvalds, the software engineer who became the principal architect behind the development of the Linux operating system. Described by some as the \"anti-Gates,\" Torvalds embraced an open-source development approach.</p><p> While trading stocks ostensibly has little in common with developing software, Torvalds explained the motives behind open-source software development in terms that could just as readily have been used to describe the motivations of social finance contributors. </p><p> \"Money is not the greatest of motivators .... Folks do their best work when they are driven by passion. When they are having fun. This is as true for playwrights and sculptors and entrepreneurs as it is for software engineers .... Hackers are also motivated ... by the esteem they can gain in the eyes of their peers by making solid contributions .... Everybody wants to impress their peers, improve their reputation, elevate their social status.\"</p><p> The idea- and data-sharing openness displayed by members of StockTwits, Estimize, and SumZero might also stem from a deeper sense of self-interest: a conviction that traders become smarter when they work together to create better investment models and techniques.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We got a chance to sit down with <strong>  <u>   Joe Anthony  </u> </strong> , who is the President of Financial Services and a Partner at <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u> , a full service strategically integrated public relations firm in Ardmore, PA. Joe has some interesting and thoughtful observations on our industry.</p><p> <strong>  How did your career start? </strong> <br/> My career started when I took an internship during my senior year at Villanova University working in the investor relations department at Gregory FCA.  The opportunity combined my interest in the financial world with my passion for the news and my interest in helping businesses tell their story.  It was less than a year after my college graduation when I was given the opportunity to help launch our agency&rsquo;s specialized services for the financial services industry. Thirteen years later, we&rsquo;ve built a business unit that ranks as the 11th largest financial PR firm in the country with close to 300 industry campaigns under out belt.</p><p> <strong>  Why did you choose Financial Services? </strong> <br/> I was a Finance major and got my degree from the Villanova School of Business (then known as the School of Commerce &amp; Finance). I loved the financial world and was fascinated with Wall Street since my grandfather shared tales of working in the industry going back to the 1940&rsquo;s.   He impressed upon me that financial services was one of four major industries that he thought had long-term sustainability.</p><p> <strong>  How has the industry evolved in last decade? </strong> <br/> The industry has become more approachable for the consumer audience it serves. Technology has expedited the innovation and evolution of the business.  Financial service companies can reach anyone with a mobile device or personal computer.  At the same time, how the consumers get information and how much information they have at their fingertips has changed, so companies need to be more communicative, more transparent and aware that competition can pop up anywhere, anytime.  It&rsquo;s a more level playing field for upstarts than what we saw as we broke into the 2000&rsquo;s.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s been good about those changes?  </strong> <br/> Businesses are learning to be more thoughtful in how they serve &ndash; and how they market to &ndash; their customers. Customers have more choice in providers and how they work with those providers.  More people are equipped to be actively engaged in their financial lives.  Close to 2 decades after the big shift to 401ks (and the &ldquo;you&rsquo;re on your own&rdquo; retirement landscape), the changes have given consumers a fighting chance of actually succeeding in that.</p><p> <strong>  What makes you pause and get nervous about what&rsquo;s happening right now? </strong> <br/> There has been a massive push to deliver products and services at a lower price point. At a certain level, some quality will slip or the margins will shrink to the point of forcing out competent players in the industry.</p><p> <strong>  How does Gregory work with clients within the industry?  </strong> <br/> Gregory FCA provides integrated marketing communications services to RIAs, asset managers, ETF issuers, mutual funds, CPA firms, insurance companies, broker-dealers and others. Our clients hire us to generate media coverage, develop and refine their messaging, support product launches, manage their blog presence, develop social media strategies and deliver their narrative in written, visual and multimedia forms.</p><p> <strong>  How can you effect change within the boundaries of what you do to better either what they do, or how they&rsquo;re perceived?  </strong> <br/> We have aligned ourselves with many of the upstarts in the ETF and RIA industries.  Much of the innovation in the industry has been galvanized by firms that have challenged the status quo.  The first hedge fund position replication ETF wasn&rsquo;t launched by Blackrock or Vanguard. The first cyber security ETF came from an issuer with less than $10 million in AUM at the time.  United Capital has done more to positively change the financial advice business than Merrill Lynch over the last five years. These are the firms we get to work with to tell their stories and amplify their messages &ndash; that&rsquo;s how we support positive change.</p><p> <strong>  Who out there do you think is positioned to be the next breakthrough and be a major name? </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s hard to play favorites with a roster of clients that I think are each doing powerful things to make a difference in the business and in the lives of their clients. That being said, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the work that Eileen McDonnell has done in reaching out to women and younger professionals to get them engaged in the business of financial services.  She has put the weight of her firm, Penn Mutual, behind the effort in a meaningful way.  In Houston, there is a father-son team that run Tanglewood Wealth Management that has accepted the challenge of digitally-enabled advisors like WealthFront and used technology to help run their business more efficiently, cut fees for their clients and maintain profitability.  Firms like that will survive while those that refuse to change their business model will suffer.</p><p> <strong>  What firms need some major help in redefining who they are, or need to pivot to keep up with where the industry is going?  </strong> <br/> Tricky question.  You can see the old guard firms are trying hard to repackage their offerings and change the language they are using to describe their services.  Northwestern Mutual Life and Fidelity are two firms that made splashy acquisitions to help them stay relevant &ndash; and in some ways play catch up to shifts in consumer behavior and technology.</p><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s touch on Robo&mdash;do millennials really want to only work on their devices and never want to talk to someone about their finances?   </strong> <br/> Millenials have grown up where they can manage their life via the mobile devices.  Bank accounts. Dinner reservations. Concert tickets. Organize parties.  Whatever they want to do, most of it can be facilitated online, via apps, etc.  At the same time, the experience matters. The financial customer experience happens both in terms of the delivery of the services online and in person.  Financial advisers will be more likely to host client appreciation events at a craft brewery than at a golf course.  Millenials will want the flexibility to call, text, log-in or drop-in on their financial advisor. It&rsquo;s not just an in-person service delivery or digital only, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;all of the above.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Many of your articles are about what&rsquo;s currently happening&mdash;what gets you to the point where you have to let what your thinking out to share with all of us?   </strong> <br/> Often, I see certain news items or developments get overhyped where the real implications are small compared to the headlines.  At the same time, I see the focus needing to be reoriented to a different view of the news. For example, with Northwestern Mutual Life&rsquo;s acquisition of LearnVest, I felt compelled to point out the fact that the old guard no longer has a choice in terms of adapting to the changing consumer. They are acquiring relevance where they failed to maintain it.  That should be an alarm bell for other firms that are not moving quickly enough to adapt.  I try to hit on those messages because it very often isn&rsquo;t necessarily a fundamental change in the business itself but how the business delivers its services and products that is changing &ndash; and that&rsquo;s an area where we can add value to firms who are trying to reimagine how they reach their audiences.</p><p> <strong>  What are your predictions for the industry for the next three years? </strong> <br/> A few things: more consolidation in the RIA landscape. I can see an RIA acquirer or two going public &ndash; or, at the very least, acquiring another consolidator.  I think on the ETF front, we&rsquo;ll see a strong &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; of ETF issuers.  They won&rsquo;t have the assets of a Blackrock, State Street or Vanguard, but there will be clear separation of about a dozen firms outside the top 10 issuers from the pack of sponsors that might have 2 or 3 products.</p><p> <strong>  What do you enjoy most about your job?   </strong> <br/> Getting to talk with a lot of bright people who are excited by what they do every day and hear their various points of view on some of the same issues.  I find it fascinating that intelligent, well-educated, well-informed people can have so many different ideas about how the business works, where the opportunities are, etc.  At the same time, it is our job to capture our clients&rsquo; stories and ideas and help them relate it in a way that supports their business.  You hear some incredibly interesting things when you hear how they aim to impact the world with what they are doing.</p><p> <strong>  What would you like to leave us with? </strong> <br/> There has never been a better time to be in the financial services industry.  Change is everywhere and that change begets opportunity.  The ETF business has shown that a manager that might&rsquo;ve taken 3 to 5 years to raise $500 million in a mutual fund can now do so in six months if they&rsquo;ll change the wrapper they use to distribute their product.  The growth of large RIA firms like United Capital and Exencial Wealth Advisors show us that nimble firms who aren&rsquo;t afraid to think differently can attract the best talent from inside &ndash; and outside &ndash; the industry.  Robo-advisors have forced traditional advisory firms to reapproach how they serve clients. Change can be tough, but being forced to be better is a good thing for individuals, companies and the industry as a whole.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Every successful leader I have encountered has a story. I am not necessarily saying they are a story teller, although that doesn't hurt. What I mean is they have become a successful leader through a memorable journey that has taught them something. </p><p> What is the difference between people with just \"lessons learned\" vs leaders? People with \"lessons learned\" think they now have the right answer, and stop looking to learn. Leaders take those lessons, apply them forward, and know another lesson is right around the corner.</p><p> When a person thinks they have the right answer, they fall victim to \"illusions of certainty\" and become less receptive to the environment around them. With customers, employees, partners, and the economy constantly going through change, it is hard to imagine that any type of certainty will hold true for very long.</p><p> True leaders recognize this and treat lessons as directional, not absolute. They find a way to apply the learnings to the next lesson, which then provides more insights that are applied to the next lesson, and so on. This results in an on-going learning process that great leaders not only understand, but they leverage it.</p><h3> Leaders don't mind being wrong.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, many leaders love to be proven wrong. Although they might be skeptical, they want a person or team to show them what is possible beyond what they have already seen. </p><p> So if you are hoping to truly be a leader to those around you, realize that being right isn't the answer. Taking chances to be wrong is the real game changer.</p>",

Anthony Iannarino </u></p><p> We think that we will lose the  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/blog/2014/10/03/choosing-to-compete-for-transactions-or-relationships/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   relationship  </a> </u>  we have with our client or prospect by bringing up the difficult issues that they don&rsquo;t really want to face. We believe that speaking to or about those issues will somehow cause us to lose their trust, especially when it&rsquo;s clear that they are dealing with a challenging issue. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p><h3> Fear of Going First</h3><p> <br/> The lesser salesperson isn&rsquo;t brave enough to bring up their client&rsquo;s deepest, most difficult challenges because they are afraid they will alienate the client by asking them to face their real  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/blog/2012/08/21/whos-the-hero-in-the-story-you-tell/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   dragon  </a> </u> . To the client who is dealing with the challenge, that salesperson doesn&rsquo;t look like someone who can help, someone who can make a real difference.</p><h3> Courage and Trust</h3><p> <br/> The person who gains their client&rsquo;s trust is the person who has the courage to address the issue they are struggling with. The willingness to engage around the difficult issues is what makes that person  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/blog/2015/04/20/protect-your-clients-from-harm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   someone worth doing business with  </a> </u> . It demonstrates that you are willing to help them with something you both recognize is going to be difficult. This doesn&rsquo;t destroy trust&mdash;it builds it.</p><h3> You Go First</h3><p> <br/> Your clients need to be brave. Change is always a step into the unknown. It is difficult to make real change in any organization, even a small team. It means that people have to agree to face their fears, and it means they have to do things differently.</p><p> You need to be brave in order to help your clients. You have to have the courage to address the issues that might make things more difficult for you by making a deal more complicated to win.</p><p> You have to be brave enough to commit yourself to helping your client make improvements. You have to have the intestinal fortitude to commit yourself to being accountable for helping your client make the changes and steer them clear to the other side of their challenge. Doing these things will  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/blog/2015/02/19/how-to-be-a-trusted-advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   earn you their trust  </a> </u> .</p><p> When it comes to having the courage to deal with the biggest and most challenging problems your clients have, you need to go first. If you are going to ask your client to have courage, you need to first show it yourself.</p>",

    "content": "<p> This is the fourth in a four part series from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0983762082/ref=cm_sw_su_dp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Pocket Guide to Sales for Financial Advisors  </a> </u> , by Beverly D. Flaxington</p><p> T he selling process, to those who have not been trained in it, has its own mystique. The scripts, the proper words at the proper time, and the ability to listen past an objection someone is presenting to you in order to find what they really need are all skills that few people possess naturally. So how does a financial professional&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;one who wants to grow his business and desires to sell more effectively&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;do this in a comfortable and effective manner? Let&rsquo;s look at five tenets of successful selling:</p><h3> 1. Engage in Relationship</h3><p> As talked about in the previous section, selling is all about being in relationship with another person, couple, or group. It may be a short relationship if you decide not to work together, or a long relationship if they become a client. It may be a relationship wherein they choose to work with you, or if they do not, perhaps they recommend a family member or friend for your wealth planning services. Many selling terms&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;for example &ldquo;the target,&rdquo; &ldquo;the prospect,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the close&rdquo;&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;sound negative and treat the person trying to make the decision as if they were a fish you were trying to get on your hook. However, if you change the dynamic and the way you think about the selling process, you will change your own attitude to a more positive one. Most advisors are excellent in client relationships&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;trustworthy, reliable, and honest. Those same skills need to be pulled into the selling process.</p><h3> 2. Think in Terms of Problem Solving</h3><p> Selling, at its root, is simply solving a problem for a client by offering a solution that meets their needs.</p><p> Many businesses have the &ldquo;if we build it, they will come and buy it&rdquo; mentality, and they find out too late that not enough people saw the solution to their problems in what was built. Your job is to uncover the underlying problem and understand how your prospect talks about that problem. You want to get a window into why it is a problem, and what success looks like to them.</p><p> Most of us don&rsquo;t realize what kind of problems we have until someone brings them to our attention. Think about an inventor such as Steve Jobs. No one knew they needed an iPod, iPhone, or iPad until he sold us on them! So your job in selling is two-fold&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you need to ask the right questions to help someone uncover a problem you can solve, and also to paint a picture of what someone might be dealing with that would lead them to need your product, service, or solution.</p><p> Life insurance salespeople are particularly adept at this. When a person has their first child, an insurance person can stun them with stories of uninsured parents who left their children helpless and without financial support. Most new parents don&rsquo;t realize this is a problem, but after hearing the horror stories about other young couples, many realize that they have a potential problem for which they need to be prepared. It works the same with financial planning&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;think of existing clients who came in thinking they didn&rsquo;t have a problem, or identifying the wrong problem, or overlooking some very important information.</p><h3> 3. Know When to Go for the Close</h3><p> Effectively qualifying and knowing how and when to close is the place where so many professional salespeople falter. In many cases, a suspect or prospect is a warm body who offers an opportunity for a potential sale. As the hope-to-be seller, you may spend a lot of time providing information, following up with phone calls, keeping the person in your pipeline, and assuming there are assets attached that will someday be yours.</p><p> The problem is that you don&rsquo;t want to be distracted by people who will never actually work with you. Some prospects may take years to close, so don&rsquo;t immediately walk away from prospects that don&rsquo;t show short-term interest. The longer-term ones may belong on your drip list to send marketing materials and updates to over time. Importantly, though, to determine who is short and who is long term for the close, you need to continually ask yourself, &ldquo;At this time, does this person have a need or problem they are trying to solve, and do they recognize this problem?&rdquo; The truth is that not everyone is a prospect: There are people who are simply curious. There are people who are nice and will talk with you all day with no intention to ever buy. There are people who want to shop around and make sure whatever they currently have is the best available. It&rsquo;s your job to focus on the people who are deserving of your time and attention right now, and weed out those who will waste your time with no return on your investment.</p><p> As the service provider, you have a right to know at each stage of the process what&rsquo;s happening with your prospect and why. If they ask you for something&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;brochure, information, to run some numbers, etc.&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you can ask why they need it and what they are hoping to gain from it: &ldquo;Help me to understand your decision-making process. How will you use this brochure? What will you do with it? I&rsquo;m happy to send it, but I just want to understand your thinking about its importance to make sure it is the best piece for you at this time.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Don&rsquo;t Hesitate to Ask for the Business</h3><p> We often observe advisors not making it clear to a client that they are looking for new business, or to the prospect that they want their business! We all like to be asked&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we don&rsquo;t want to be the one to assume the forward position, so be sure you are continually reminding the person how much you&rsquo;d like their business (or additional business): &ldquo;My objective is to meet your needs and I am confident I can do that effectively, so I ask that you consider working with me. Are we able to pick a date that we can sign an agreement and start working together?&rdquo;</p><p> Summarize the key points of agreement or benefits acknowledged and ask them if you&rsquo;ve missed anything. If not, ask them if there&rsquo;s any reason why they couldn&rsquo;t become a client now.</p><p> Many a sale has been lost because the advisor engaging in the process did everything right, but then neglected to actually ask for the business when the time was right!</p><h3> 5. Use the Opportunity to Deepen the Relationship</h3><p> While advisors talk about the importance of relationships and the depth of relationships they have with strategic alliances and clients, the truth is that there is always room for improvement. Find every opportunity to deepen a relationship by learning more about the person and what they care about, by holding events and providing education they could find useful, and by providing information they can use and share. If an advisor is investing in relationships on an ongoing basis and paying attention to clients and alliances outside of scheduled meetings, the process of asking for referrals and finding new prospects becomes much easier. Make sure you have recorded significant events and milestones for clients. Know their interests and hobbies. Know what information they have and use in financial decision- <br/> making, and provide what they need. Find ways to provide value outside of the investment process.</p><p> Having new information, material, or updates to share can sometimes be the &ldquo;ping&rdquo; that a client needs to pass it along to someone else. Asking a client about a vacation and learning they love to golf is the clue to invite them to your golf club or send them monogrammed golf balls for their next trip. Learning about charitable interests and volunteer opportunities gives you a chance to talk about philanthropy.</p><p> Good financial advisors continually work a relationship and find ways to stay top-of-mind to the prospect. While you should qualify and be careful not to waste time, the flip side is that things change in the prospect&rsquo;s life, and you want to remind them you are there and available to help when they need you.</p><p> Life is an exchange; in many cases, when you show a sincere interest in them as they are and not as you are, the person will often show a sincere interest in return. If someone believes you can meet their needs, solve their problem, and understand who they are, they will be loyal and committed unless something happens in the relationship.</p><p> If followed, these five tenets of successful selling will take your sales abilities to higher levels of success&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and as a bonus they will, generally, help to improve your relationships. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnswersForSleep\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dr. Robert S. Rosenberg  </u> </a></p><p> Recently I was asked by a friend&rsquo;s son if it were possible to learn while asleep. He had read about sleep helping with memory and wondered if he could tape some of his lectures and listen to them while asleep. I told him that is an interesting idea but that it does not work. However, as I explained to him, sleep does serve to improve our memories. We just can&rsquo;t learn new information being presented while asleep.</p><h3> There are three broad types of memories:</h3><p> <br/> Declarative memory, which can be expressed verbally; Procedural memory such as learning to ride a bike, drive a car, or play an instrument; and Emotional memory.</p><h3> There are two main types of sleep:</h3><p> <br/> REM or dream sleep and Non-REM sleep which comprises the other stages of sleep including the most important, deep or delta sleep. They come on in cycles every 90 minutes. The Non-REM deep sleep prevails in the first half of the night, and REM sleep dominates during the second half of the night. Non-REM sleep is more important for absorbing declarative memory (factual) and REM sleep is essential in procedural and emotional memory.</p><p> During the process of memory consolidation, your brain uploads short term unstable packets of information plus experiences and then converts them to more stable and longer lasting memories. It also integrates them with prior memories. This process has been linked to the stages of sleep.</p><p> Accordingly, besides insuring that we get a good night&rsquo;s sleep, is there anything else we can do to improve our memory? Several studies paired learning before sleep with either sounds or odors. When the subjects were re-exposed to these sounds or odors while asleep and during specific stages of sleep, they showed a significant improvement in memory retention when tested.</p><p> Other studies have shown that increasing deep sleep with the aid of a very low frequency direct current improved memory retention the following day. However, all of this is experimental and I would caution the reader to be skeptical of gadgets worn to bed that are claiming to improve your memory. The good news is that we are realizing the importance of sleep with regard to memory and I believe it won&rsquo;t be long before we have the ability to improve memory.</p><p> Get Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s Latest Book,  Sleep Soundly Every Night, Feel Fantastic Every Day: A Doctor's Guide to Solving Your Sleep Problems , <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Soundly-Every-Night-Fantastic/dp/1936303728/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396990880&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sleep+soundly+every+night\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>",

    "link": "investment-trends-shaping-our-industrys-future",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I attended iShares Connect in New York this past week, a conference focused on bringing together industry leaders in the ETF space. Attendees heard from a variety of investment experts and thought leaders and had an open dialogue about where our industry is headed.</p><p> Here are three trends that are shaping the future of the financial landscape:</p><h3> We are entering the age of the investor</h3><p> <br/> Today, 45% of clients are researching investments online and doing their own due diligence before committing to their investments. This should come as no surprise. Think about the last time you considered making a large purchase, let&rsquo;s say buying a car. Did you go straight to the dealership or did you first go online to research models and prices?</p><p> Of course, most of us go online first and head to the dealership only when we feel confident we can have an educated conversation. And although the regulatory environment makes our industry vastly different, more and more investment information is becoming available to the general public. We should embrace this and see it as an opportunity. From a marketing standpoint, financial advisors should create an online presence that helps define who they are and what they stand for. It&rsquo;s important to be a searchable online presence in today&rsquo;s marketplace, so that when clients are ready to talk, they know where to turn.</p><h3> Technology and online advice platforms are a driving force of change</h3><p> <br/> Although the robo advisors have yet to capture a large percentage of market share, they are getting it right when it comes to communication. Some of today&rsquo;s top robo advisors are delivering simple, easy to understand investments at a low cost; they are helping the industry better understand how we need to be talking to clients. In other words, we need to be communicating with clients in plain English. Words matter. We don&rsquo;t do ourselves any favors using terms that don&rsquo;t make sense to clients.</p><h3> The democratization of investing is changing clients&rsquo; expectations</h3><p> <br/> Within five years, an estimated 70% of assets in the U.S. will be sitting with retirees and pre-retirees 1 . Individual investors would thereby essentially become their own CFOs. According to Henry Fernandez, CEO of MSCI, we need to decide what the investor needs and package investments to give them the outcomes they seek.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s pre-retirees and retirees are less concerned about alphas and betas and more concerned about having enough money to retain their standard of living throughout their retirement. As we move from a passive population, dependent on income from defined benefit and pension plans, to a population that self-funded their defined contribution plans through 401(k)s, increasingly clients are used to being actively involved in their own investments.</p><h3> The Main Takeaway</h3><p> <br/> In the age of the individual investor, we need to communicate with clients in ways that don&rsquo;t require them to have a master&rsquo;s degree. If we can help a larger percentage of the population focus on investing for the long term, it will be better for clients, financial advisors, asset managers, and our overall economy.</p>1.

    "link": "understanding-the-high-net-worth-client",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There are not many things that a room full of financial planners or investment advisers will agree upon - but an area sure to gain consensus is the need to work with High Net Worth (HNW) clients. However, while most advisers aspire to work with HNW clients, very few do so successfully with any scale or significance. Most have a few HNW clients, but all too few of them.</p><h3> Why?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  I think it comes down to some relatively straightforward reasons: </strong></p><p> 1. Advisers don't understand what a HNW client is for their own business needs;</p><p> 2. Advisers don't know where to find them;</p><p> 3. Advisers don't work out what matters to the HNW clients, and then deliver accordingly.</p><p> The first point may seem a no brainer to many &ndash; yet it is anything but. Is a HNW client the person someone earning $300,000 per annum with a $2 million dollar home (with a million dollar mortgage), a flash company (or leased) car in the driveway? Or is it the person who lives perhaps more modestly in the suburbs and on a more modest income, but who has accumulated a $3,000,000 investment portfolio?</p><p> Either of these profiles could met somebody's HNW definition. But finding them, and appealing to them as an advice provider, might take very different strategies.</p><p> To successfully pursue a strategy of building a HNW clientele, the very first step is to be clear about what those clients look like. Understanding more than just the demographics and fiscal measures that define your target market, you need to understand their issues and typical motivators before you are able to realistically find them in volume and be of interest to them.</p><h3> Finding them?</h3><p> <br/> In this country, many of the clients who would qualify as HNW are not found loitering about in easy-to-spot packs, moving from one ridiculously priced wine bar to another. There is rarely a watering hole that you can go to and find the HNW herd gathered together conveniently.</p><p> But, they do mix socially, they do business together, and they often have extensive business networks and wide circles of influence. Personal introduction, word of mouth marketing, centre of influences - these are the ways to find and approach the HNW client. It takes time and personal observation and good positioning to create those initial opportunities. And, it will usually take quite some time before you gather the first few ideal HNW clients.</p><p> Part of getting that positioning right is directly linked to the third and vital reason for so few financial planners or investment advisers appealing to HNW clients. More often than not, we do not take time to understand the affluent client, and then fail to address their specific needs and beliefs.</p><p> If there is one common denominator that applies universally to HNW clients, and it is that they value their time. They will pay more than others will for convenience and saving time, and there is also generally a very high quality expectation. Perhaps there's nothing terribly surprising there. But, are your advice and service offerings built to minimise the time your clients have to spend in the process? And do you demonstrate the highest quality standards at every touch point in your business?</p><h3> If you don't do that as a minimum, you will simply not appeal to HNW sector.</h3><p> <br/> However, positioning effectively for HNW clients extends beyond just focusing on time effectiveness and quality as hallmarks of your practice. These are entry level considerations &ndash; minimum service expectations, if you like.</p><p> HNW clients also expect quality to be demonstrated with timely, not mechanical, communication that is highly personalised. They expect extremely high levels of knowledge and expertise - extremely high. They expect silver service, or white glove treatment. Practices focused upon the HNW sector might have, at most, two service levels - excellent world class silver service standard, and then there is WOW. No other standards matter.</p><p> And, that world class silver service standard has to be delivered consistently, and constantly, without exception.</p><p> Other advisers that appeal to HNW clients are those who coordinate and facilitate on the client's behalf. They lead projects, interact and create working teams of professionals all operating for the benefit of the client, they actively seek areas where they can remove stress, risk or time consuming issues for the client.</p><p> Marketing needs to be at a more intimate level - highly personalised and with a healthy degree of exclusivity... although without creating \"elitism\" perhaps.</p><p> The overwhelming communication method for HNW clients is one-to-one human engagement, either in person or on the phone. Email should be used for verification of details and to create an audit trail. Email is not how to have a conversation with a HNW client. Social media is merely a method of networking, perhaps.</p><p> A final generalisation about HNW clients worth considering is that they are very often quite focused on health, and it is a significant motivator for them. Certainly, physical health is often high on their priority list - but, just as important is a wider concept of health. Family health &ndash; the dynamics and closeness and the bonds of the family unit - is usually a higher concern than for other demographics, as is financial health, and (for lack of a better term) spiritual health. A sense of legacy and community, and involvement are often strong drivers for HNW clients.</p><p> To attract HNW clients, we must understand how and why they are different to other clients we're used to dealing with. Then, we must build service and support systems to cater specifically to HNW clients' requirements. In other words, target marketing, supported by precise positioning. When that is achieved, there is a good chance that referral marketing and centresof-influence can generate opportunities the financial planner or investment adviser is seeking.</p>",

    "content": "<p> So many people aspire to be top dog, the Big Kahuna, the CEO, that they cease to realize that sometimes it&rsquo;s more fun, fulfilling, and energizing to be Number Two. The person who sits on the top of the org chart does not have a monopoly on influence, nor does a box determine your value. </p><p> I often work with clients who want their boss&rsquo;s job. They want to do everything they can to set themselves up for success. I always suggest that the first thing that they should do is to lean into the relationship with their boss and set the team up for success&hellip; good things will follow.</p><p> Some refer to it as &ldquo;Two in a Box&rdquo; or &ldquo;co-leading,&rdquo; <strong>  I call it the Power of Two. </strong>  At one time I wanted to be the leader in my division, but I already was a leader with influence and opportunity. Instead of  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-request-no-promotion-please/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   longing for my next promotion  </a> </u> , I relished the unique leadership position of Number Two.  </p><p> I was the unofficial Number Two in our division and reported in to Number One.  He was more than my boss, I was lucky that he was also a friend and someone who realized that he too needed the Power of Two.  We had complementary skills and backgrounds and I was not in competition with him or gunning for his job.  I was on his team and more importantly, I always felt like he was on mine, we were in it together. </p><p> In truth, there are upsides and downsides to every relationship.  The downside was we were viewed as &ldquo;a package deal.&rdquo; (Hello, two in a box) When his reputation took a beating, mine did too.  When his leadership was called into question, mine was too. I felt the sting while he took the slap.  My corporate identity was closely tied to his, but I had the confidence to know that I was very much my own person and doing meaningful work focused on people,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leading-innovation-to-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   change and innovation  </a> </u> .</p><p> Yes, there were other senior leaders in our division as well as directors and managers all the way down the line.  Every single person in the operation was critical to our success.  We were not an official team of two, our unique relationship took shape organically, not based on some fancy chart dictating hierarchy and relationships. </p><h3> The Power of Two</h3><p> <br/> Number One always speaks first in meetings. </p><p> <strong>  Number Two is grateful that they have time to reflect.  </strong></p><p> Number One stands at the front of the room.</p><p> <strong>  Number Two sits in the audience and hears the whispers of what&rsquo;s really on their minds. </strong></p><p> Number One is frequently told what others think she wants to hear.</p><p> <strong>  Number Two is asked to brainstorm before meetings with Number One.  </strong></p><p> Number One has everything they say and do on the record.</p><p> <strong>  Number Two can freely share opinions.  </strong></p><p> Number One asks for opinions and is often met with silence. </p><p> <strong>  Number Two gets an earful of the real deal.  </strong></p><p> Number One thinks they&rsquo;re super funny because everyone laughs at their jokes. </p><p> <strong>  Number Two smiles knowing Number One isn&rsquo;t fooled by the laughter. </strong>  </p><p> Number One has an advisor and partner on the journey.</p><p> <strong>  Number Two is empowered and trusted to speak for the team.  </strong></p><p> Number One asks Number Two for thoughts and ideas.</p><p> <strong>  Number Two is called forth to lead and not simply wait for direction.  </strong></p><h3> It&rsquo;s Good to be Two. </h3><p> <br/> Two minds focused on solutions and success. </p><p> Two people honest about strengths and challenges.</p><p> Two humans where you can both  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/find-personal-leadership-truth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   speak your truth  </a> </u> .</p><p> A team.

I&rsquo;m not one for sugar coating the truth, so here goes&hellip;You might be really great at closing the sale when you&rsquo;re face to face with a prospect, but I can tell you when it comes to online marketing&hellip;<strong> Let&rsquo;s just say, there&rsquo;s a LOT of room for improvement.</strong>Last month I created a training workshop on how to <u> <a href=\"https://401kbestpractices.com/about-old/products/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  position your business for growth </a></u>, and here&rsquo;s what I noticed when I reviewed the profiles of twenty 401k advisors&hellip;With an average score of 30 out of 100 points on the <u> online profile assessment</u>, it became quite clear that advisors should NOT be trying to do social marketing.You are good at sales and building relationships and helping participants.  Social media is just not your thing.You probably hate having to deal with compliance regarding what you can and can&rsquo;t put on your website and you may even think of social media as a waste of time.  To this I say &ndash;<strong> For the love of all things creative, responsive and effective&hellip; outsource already!</strong>When I was writing <u> <a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/position-yourself-online-as-a-401k-specialist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  last week&rsquo;s blog post </a></u> trying to find a few examples of 401k advisors that had a complete, fully integrated online and social media presence, I was left scratching my head in frustration.I looked up websites of advisors who are subscribed to my blog updates, I scanned the profiles of the 401k Wire&rsquo;s Most Influential DC Advisors and even looked up the PLANSPONSOR Retirement Plan Advisor of the Year award recipients and still had a hard time finding 401k advisors that had a consistent and professional presence across all online profiles.It&rsquo;s not your fault.  Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, websites &ndash; these are not things you should be spending your valuable time on.  As I said before, your talent lies in selling, servicing, and helping 401k plan sponsors and participants.But with almost 1000 views on last week&rsquo;s post, I received over a dozen emails.  Some folks questioned the benefit of having anything more than your contact information online.  Still others wanted to know if, instead of <u> reviewing your social media presence</u> and telling you what you should do to fix the gaps, I could just offer a Done-4-You service to lay the foundation and set up your social media profiles for you.Let me first address the importance of having a strong presence online.  This is what I call&hellip;<h3> The Bad News</h3>It is absolutely important that you have a strong online presence if you want to grow your practice. Like it or not, technology is here to stay and is quickly becoming a more essential part of our daily lives and how our prospects find and engage with us. In fact, you&rsquo;re reading this post right now from my LinkedIn profile and chances are, we&rsquo;ve never even met.There is no more yellow pages.  Well, there is, but I shred it and use it as nesting box material in my chicken coop :-).<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GkgUGoKxwzc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"486\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-25-at-2.43.08-PM.png\" width=\"851\"/></a><strong> Even business cards are becoming pointless, according to Gary Vaynerchuk</strong>&mdash; New York Times and Wall Street Journal Best-Selling author and serial entrepreneur.

    "content": "<p> Cultivating Conscientious Culture &hellip; Say that 3 times fast.</p><p> <strong>  And yet if your workplace culture is missing conscientiousness, your workplace is probably suffering. </strong></p><p> Conscientiousness is the trait of being thorough, careful and vigilant. It is the desire to do a task well. It is a by-product of high integrity and strong principles.</p><p> <strong>  When there is a lack of conscientiousness , you will usually notice one or more of the following are also common occurrences in your workplace: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Tardiness. </strong> Whether it is late arrivals to work or late reports turned in to the boss, if you have issues with tardiness in your workplace, you have a conscientiousness problem.</li><li> <strong>  Finger-pointing or the blame game. </strong> If your employees are quick to declare what&rsquo;s not their job or why another employee&rsquo;s/department&rsquo;s actions are causing shortcomings, you have a conscientiousness problem.</li><li> <strong>  Mistakes. </strong> If there are regular errors in the work or lapses of sound decision-making in your workplace, you have a consciousness problem.</li><li> <strong>  Disorganization. </strong> If your processes are unclear or your record-keeping is disjointed, you have a consciousness problem.</li><p> <br/> Much like leadership ability, there are varying schools of thoughts on whether conscientiousness is something you just innately have or whether conscientiousness can be developed. I choose to believe conscientiousness can be developed. I choose to believe conscientiousness can be cultivated in our workplace culture.</p><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re having challenges in your workplace, here are 3 easy things you can take to begin cultivating a conscientious culture today: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Reset expectations. </strong> Start with refreshing employees on the requirements on attendance, dress code and standards of conduct. Most of our workplace policies have conscientious behaviors built in. Reminding employees of the behaviors expected of them is the first step in cultivating conscientious culture.</li><li> <strong>  Outline deadlines. </strong> Be clear about when work assignments are due as well as the goals, parameters and format. Make employees responsible to meet the deadlines with results that are complete, thorough and accurate. When errors happen, ask your employees questions that require critical thinking and thoughtful answers.  Have them correct the errors and resubmit the work. Keep doing this until the work is consistently completed without issues. Holding employees accountable in this way is crucial to cultivating conscientious culture.</li><li> <strong>  Recognize and reward. </strong> Most managers spend the majority of their time on trying to get problem employees to perform. Stop doing this!! Know who the best, most conscientious people are in your workplace and focus your energy and efforts on them. Recognize them publicly and privately for their results. Reward them with greater salary, bonuses and incentives. Everyone wants to be favored at work. Show your employees what behaviors are valued and to be repeated. Copycats will emerge to cultivate conscientious culture.</li><p> <br/> Consistent conscientiousness is difficult to maintain, even in the best of workplaces. However, it is necessary to ensure excellence and integrity in your culture and business outputs.</p><p> <strong>  Start cultivating a conscientious culture today. It will not be easy. But will definitely be worth it. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cullenroche\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cullen Roche  </a> </u>  |  <a href=\"http://orcamgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Orcam Financial Group  </u> </a></p><p> I wrote this post about two years ago, but its message and lessons are as relevant today as they were back then:</p><p> The economy continues to do okay, the stock market is hitting all-time highs every day, real estate is back on the up and up, interest rates remain very low by historical terms, the net worth of Americans is back at all-time highs, we&rsquo;ve just dragged ourselves out of the worst recession in 80 years, but people are still upset about a lot of things.  I guess that&rsquo;s to be expected in an environment with 7.6% unemployment. That&rsquo;s not exactly a happy number.  But I have a feeling that there&rsquo;s more to this general unhappiness than meets the eye.  And I think a lot of people are mad because the fear case has totally lost out at this point.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve been paying attention over the last few years, you probably remember how many people predicted hyperinflation, surging bond yields, soaring gold prices, a cratering US Dollar and a collapsing stock market.  This was the fear trade.  You overweight gold, short US government bonds, short the USD, short equities and laugh all the way to the bank.  Parts of that trade have worked out OKAY (like the gold portion over the years), but on the whole that trade has been a big disaster.  In other words, fear lost out &ndash; again.  And I think a lot of people who bought into the fearmongering nonsense are angry.  They&rsquo;re angry because they backed their political beliefs with their wallet.  They&rsquo;re angry because they listened to so-called &ldquo;experts&rdquo; peddling their political beliefs as an understanding of the monetary system.  They&rsquo;re angry because they read scary websites that claim to have predicted the crisis, but have gotten almost everything wrong since 2008.  They&rsquo;re angry because they let their emotions get in the way of sound analysis.</p><h3> Look, there&rsquo;s plenty to be upset about.  </h3><p> <br/> I am not here to claim that all is well in the economy and in the USA.  In a lot of ways this country feels as disjointed as ever.  But I see a lot of people who seem to be upset for reasons that can be pinpointed to little more than their ideological beliefs.  If I am right then these people have no one to be upset at but themselves for constantly buying into this fearmongering nonsense.  You have to be very careful approaching the monetary system and the economy with an ideological or political bent.  It will lead you astray at times.  I know it has certainly led a lot of people astray in the last 5 years&hellip;.</p><p> The good news is it&rsquo;s never to late to learn from mistakes.  I&rsquo;ve made plenty of mistakes over the last 5 years.  But I always try to learn from mistakes.  So the question is, will people actually try to approach the monetary system and the economy objectively, rationally and apolitically?  Or will they continue to expose themselves to the same biases and ideological pitfalls that have led so many people to fall for the fear trade?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Bec Oakley </u></p><p> Despite the fact that Minecraft isn&rsquo;t a game that was specifically designed for kids, millions have taken to it with a passion and loyalty usually only reserved for books about boy wizards. The game is now everywhere and its fans can be extremely devoted... and this is where the problem lies for a lot of parents.</p><p> Their kids eat, sleep and breathe Minecraft. They want to play it all day and night... and if they&rsquo;re not playing it then they&rsquo;re talking about playing it, or watching YouTube videos of other people playing it.</p><p> So what is it about the game that brings on this level of devotion? How do you get okay with that, and where&rsquo;s the line between obsession and addiction? Let's look at how to manage a Minecraft obsession.</p><h3> Why Do Kids Love Minecraft</h3><p> <br/> Until you&rsquo;ve played the game yourself it can be really hard to understand just what it is that kids find so fascinating about this world of blocks. It's often called 'online Lego', but although they might be visually similar the two offer quite different playing experiences. Minecraft is like building something with Lego after you made and moulded the plastic yourself, and then going on an adventure inside it through jungles and oceans and deserts while monsters are chasing you. And when you tire of that, you can blow it all up and start again.</p><p> Kids are attracted to Minecraft by the chance to be super creative in a cool environment with just a few simple rules. The first-person player perspective really immerses them into a world of their own creation, in which they&rsquo;re in control and can decide where to live and when to eat and what to do. They build their own safe spaces from which they feel emboldened to venture out and take risks. They experience the thrill of the chase and the freedom to run and explore and just be.</p><p> They can also decide when and what to destroy, and that combination of both construction and destruction is part of what makes the game so much fun. And even the basic movements themselves just feel good to do - pounding on a tree until it breaks with a satisfying pop is like playing with virtual bubble wrap.</p><p> But really one of the reasons that Minecraft is so absorbing is that it&rsquo;s not just about building and being creative, it&rsquo;s doing these things in an environment that makes it hard to do. It&rsquo;s just the right balance of challenge and reward and fun - not so hard that you give up, but not so easy that it becomes boring. That makes it incredibly attractive and engaging to play.</p><p> And for many kids, Minecraft is so much more than a game - it&rsquo;s a way to express themselves. What they choose to create, the adventures they invent, even the way their character looks is a reflection on their experiences and interests and skills. They can put their individual stamp on the game, and have an instant connection to a whole community of like-minded people with whom they can share all of that.</p><h3> But Why Do Some Become Obsessed With It?</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever had a DIY project that you couldn&rsquo;t wait to get started on? A new recipe you were dying to try, or a great book that you couldn&rsquo;t put down in the wee hours of the night? That&rsquo;s what it can feel like for kids playing Minecraft. Except when you get to the end of the book another chapter suddenly appears, one that&rsquo;s even more exciting than the entire book you just finished. So you quickly read to the end of that chapter and another one opens up... so you read a few pages more... and a few more... and suddenly it&rsquo;s morning.</p><p> On the outside Minecraft can seem simple, but it&rsquo;s actually quite complex and almost every moment is filled with learning and new discoveries. You&rsquo;re continually presented with new challenges, and the reward of solving them just opens the door to another round of things to figure out and achieve. The world itself is endless and the challenges never stop... this is not a game to be played in half an hour.</p><p> There&rsquo;s also constant novelty. Unlike most video games, every Minecraft session is different from the last. It&rsquo;s impossible to get bored because you can always change what you&rsquo;re doing and have many projects on the go at once, all of which are challenging and super fun. There&rsquo;s no repetition of levels, no pre-rehearsed sequence of moves, and this never-ending cycle of novelty and discovery can really hook you in.</p><p> Minecraft is usually played from the first-person perspective, where the point of view changes as your player moves around. This is incredibly powerful and immerses you deep into the game, where the things you see and experience feel much more real than if you were watching your character run around onscreen from an outside third-person perspective. In this way you literally become your character, and this can be a very intense experience for many kids.</p><p> So Minecraft can be much more than a game for some. They feel the surge of adrenaline when they run from a monster and the very real satisfaction of finally striking diamonds deep in their hand-crafted mine. And that feeling, that richness of experience, can be incredibly compelling. It also means that they have a vested interest in what happens during the game - keeping themselves alive, protecting the fruits of their considerable labour and looking after others. This level of concern can be time-consuming and hard to disengage from.</p><p> Then there&rsquo;s the whole extension of the Minecraft experience outside of the game itself - YouTube videos, parody songs, the wiki, websites, MineCon. Kids want to learn how to make cool stuff, find answers to their questions, share their creations with others and hang out with other people who understand what they&rsquo;re talking about and why they love the game so much. This can take up more time than actually playing the game, and leads them to become part of a huge external community. So it becomes really easy to fill your mind (not to mention entire days) with all things Minecraft.</p><h3> How Do You Keep a Minecraft Obesssion Healthy?</h3><p> <br/> Minecraft can be enjoyed in a lot of really positive ways, but it&rsquo;s also easy for it to develop into some very unhealthy behaviours - going without sleep, neglecting chores and homework, even forgetting to eat or use the toilet. These can happen more easily in kids than adults, as their ability to self-manage and regulate is still developing. So how do you help them to play safely?</p><p> <strong>  Make clear boundaries </strong></p><p> If your kids are spending a lot of time playing Minecraft, setting firm rules and limits on their play will help them to find a balance where they can still enjoy the game but in a healthier way. This might mean spelling out exactly what players can and can&rsquo;t do to each other, how long and when they can play, whether they can watch YouTube videos and read the wiki or download mods. The world both inside and outside of Minecraft is huge, so you need to set some boundaries on that so your kids can operate within it safely.</p><p> <strong>  Help them to plan and self-manage </strong></p><p> Negotiate their time online - talk about how much time they think they spend in the game, whether that&rsquo;s healthy and how they might make changes. Help them to plan ahead for themselves, so that they can schedule homework and chores around game time and take control of their own time management. It's a great opportunity to teach them how to set (and stick to) their own limits and manage their interests in a healthy way, and to be rewarded for acting responsibly.</p><p> <strong>  Learn how to stay healthy </strong></p><p> Talk about the negative effects of too much computer time and not getting enough sleep or exercise, and how to recognize the signs that they need to take a break. This will help them develop skills for the times when you&rsquo;re not around to remind them. Ironically the game itself is excellent for this, because you need rest and food in order to survive there.</p><p> I like the way my friend Bil (who blogs with his wife Patty at  <a href=\"http://pancakesgoneawry.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pancakes Gone Awry </a> ) used the game to teach his kids about the importance of finding a balance in life, telling them that \"If you just mine all of the time, you'll be starving. If you farm all of the time, you'll survive, but nothing exciting will ever happen. To take care of yourself and be happy, you need to work and engage in a variety of experiences.\"</p><p> <strong>  Help them transition </strong></p><p> Minecraft is a difficult game to stop playing, especially for those kids who are obsessed, so it can be really easy to spend hours and hours in front of the screen. If this is happening in your house, you might need to provide extra structure and cues to help with transitioning (there are more tips in the article called How To Help Kids Transition When Playing Minecraft).</p><p> <strong>  Get involved </strong></p><p> A large part of helping their obsession stay healthy is just being involved so you know what's going on. There might be times when it looks like the kids aren&rsquo;t enjoying the game at all, for example - maybe they cry when they play or scream at the screen, or it&rsquo;s causing a lot of friction between siblings or friends. At those times you need to do a bit of investigating to figure out what&rsquo;s going on before deciding whether to put the brakes on their time spent playing.</p><p> You need to know what they're actually doing in the game before you can figure out where they&rsquo;re having trouble and why. Ask questions and get involved... Are they crying because they can&rsquo;t achieve their goal, or because they&rsquo;re scared of the monsters? Are they overwhelmed by choice, or do they need a break from survival mode for a while? Are they having a hard time on the server because they don't know how to use the chat feature, or has someone griefed their stuff? Are they just not emotionally mature enough and need to wait six months before giving it another try?</p><p> <strong>  Play the game </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re just watching or listening to your kids play, you&rsquo;re not immersed in it in the same way that they are - you don&rsquo;t have the same experience as a third-person observer as your kids are having as a first-person participant. So get your kids to show you around and teach you how to play - after you&rsquo;ve seen the game from their viewpoint you&rsquo;ll be in a better position to set reasonable limits, and to judge whether or not their obsession with it is okay.</p><h3> Where's the Line Between Obsession and Addiction?</h3><p> <br/> What about if your kids want to play Minecraft all day? If they beg you to let them at the iPad, scream when it&rsquo;s time to come off and hide under the covers playing it in the middle of the night? And if they&rsquo;re not playing it then they&rsquo;re talking about it... incessantly? It looks like addiction. It feels like addiction. How can you tell the difference?</p><p> This is a big concern for a lot of parents. And while video game addiction is a very real possibility, it's important to be clear about what it means before you panic and ban Minecraft from the house. Addiction is more than just an intense or all-consuming interest in something, it involves elements of dependency and compulsion. This can be hard to spot when it comes to gaming, and finding that line where a Minecraft obsession has crossed over into something more can be really difficult.</p><p> Some of the warning signs that an interest in Minecraft is becoming unhealthy might include:</p><li> The time spent playing is having a serious impact on their health or family life</li><li> They&rsquo;re lying to you about how often they play</li><li> They have symptoms of withdrawal when they&rsquo;re not playing - irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, depression</li><li> They&rsquo;re not in control of their behaviour while playing</li><li> They&rsquo;re experiencing extreme changes in mood <br/>  </li><p> If these are the kinds of behaviours that your kids are experiencing when playing Minecraft then you need to start talking with them about it, and figuring out together how to manage their obsession in a more healthy way (this is another reason why it's really helpful to have an understanding of what the game is all about). Remember too that if your kids&rsquo; interest in Minecraft is indeed an addiction, stopping it completely is going to cause psychological distress and needs to be handled very carefully.</p><h3> But What if the Obsession is Totally Driving You Nuts?</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes the problem isn't how much the kids want to play the game, but how often they want to tell you about it. Creepers and spiders and slimes, oh my!</p><p> While it&rsquo;s understandably hard to deal with an obsession that you don&rsquo;t share, Minecraft has a lot to offer and if your kids are passionate about it then it's important to find a way to be tolerant and respectful of that. It&rsquo;s not just a game to them, it can feel like meaningful work and creative expression that they take a lot of pride in - so speaking about it in a derogatory way or groaning every time they talk about it might feel really insulting.</p><p> It will also make it less likely that they&rsquo;ll share the good things about the game with you, or come to you with problems. Sure it can be exhausting dealing with the arguments and tears and frustrations, but it&rsquo;s also pretty great that they come to you to help them find solutions. You&rsquo;re an important lifeline for them, so don&rsquo;t cut yourself off from that.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t know the answers, don&rsquo;t understand the game and are just totally sick of hearing about it then at least set them up with other people that they can talk to about it. Find a friend or family member who plays, or a family-friendly multiplayer server where they can meet other kids to play with.</p><h3> The Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> Really it all boils down to this one basic idea: the key to getting the best out of Minecraft is setting your kids up to enjoy the game in a healthy way without driving you insane. Hopefully the tips in the articles on <u>  MineMum </u> will help you to find ways to do that.</p><p> <strong>  Happy mining! </strong></p>",

This can create quite a collection of records for a financial firm. While packing away all these records isn&rsquo;t wrong, it can keep advisors from being their most effective.</p><p> Record collecting can be kept in check by knowing the rules of record retention for financial advisors. Most advisory business records (trade tickets, confirmations, written communication) are required to be kept for at least five years.

However, they can organize their records cost-effectively by making use of enterprise content management (ECM) systems that automate electronic record retention schedules.</p><p> An ECM system enables a firm to securely store records and publish them to unalterable media. Firms that use ECM can:</p><li> Automate records retention and destruction in compliance with SEC 17a mandates.</li><li> Instantly retrieve information instead of sending staff to offsite storage facilities.</li><li> Expedite audits by easily producing records on demand.</li><li> Simplify compliance with business continuity directives by securing paper and electronic files.</li><li> Redact sensitive or confidential client information.</li><li> Prevent departing employees from leaving with customer files.</li><li> Strictly monitor system security.</li><li> Track when and by whom documents are accessed.</li><li> Record what staff members do with the documents they retrieve. <br/>  </li><p> Many advisors have learned to live with record hoarding by constantly monitoring all aspects of records management. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There are many benefits to an in-person client meeting such as the ways we can tell if a client understands our presentation. Client feedback and comments determine if we are on the right track. We can see a nod in agreement, a tilt of the head indicating confusion, or a blank stare that may show boredom or lack of understanding. A client can stop us in the middle of a discussion to ask questions or clarify a point.</p><p> Unlike in the past when you hand-delivered and discussed the reports with clients, you are no longer there to hold their hand every time they look at information. Your clients may still want the human touch, but the era of you spoon-feeding information is gone.</p><p> With technology delivering much of the client information, you need to review your reporting process. Is it tailored to meet each client&rsquo;s needs or does it resemble a commoditized version of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s good for one is good for all?&rdquo; Do your clients have an accurate understanding of their financial situation?</p><p> I asked an advisor how he knows his clients understand their reports. He said it&rsquo;s because they haven&rsquo;t told him otherwise. The &ldquo;no news is good news&rdquo; approach is one way to determine if they understand what you deliver.</p><p> What if you&rsquo;re wrong? What if clients are quiet because they don&rsquo;t know what questions to ask?</p><p> There is a proactive approach to ensure you are delivering the best information to your clients. </p><p> <strong>  Know your clients well </strong></p><li> Are they retirees, baby boomers, or millennials?</li><li> Do they prefer data, information, or a story?</li><li> Do they focus on goals and objectives, or transactions?</li><li> Is their preferred method of communication client portal, presentation materials, or dialogue? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Compare their style with the reports you currently provide them </strong></p><li> Are you a provider of information or a storyteller?</li><li> Do you focus on the past and the path to today, or do you begin with the present and emphasize the future?</li><li> Do your materials represent a log of historical data that you repeat during conversations, or a summary with an emphasis on discussions? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Seize opportunities to provide added-value to your clients </strong></p><p> You want each client to understand his/her financial situation and make good financial decisions. Make it your goal to educate your clients with the right reports and information.</p><p> If you want to be the core of your clients&rsquo; financial information, your reporting process should consist of collecting, aggregating, and disseminating the necessary and relevant information. If you don&rsquo;t do it, another service provider will. Review all of the sources of data, including portals, through your clients&rsquo; eyes. How many accounts can they log into to retrieve information, and in some cases, identical information?</p><p> Confirm that you are delivering what your clients can understand. Just because you love pie charts (as do most portfolio reporting software), doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone loves them. Some people prefer data presented in a table or other chart format.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t leave the process to your technology alone </strong></p><p> Today&rsquo;s technology can deliver everything from a data dump to meaningful presentations with the appropriate information behind them. Don&rsquo;t throw everything, including the kitchen sink, at your clients&rsquo; disposal and expect them to understand its entirety in the same manner as you.</p><p> <strong>  Your human touch is still needed, even when your technology is doing the talking. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In business, the reasons for success and failure can often be very complex. But when you break down marketing successes and failures, there are really just  <strong>  TWO reasons </strong>  why a service-based business is not having desired success.  </p><p> <strong>  1) You have the wrong strategy. </strong></p><p> Or</p><p> <strong>  2)You have the wrong people implementing the strategy. </strong></p><p> More often than not, we are fixing the wrong problem.</p><p> It seems pretty obvious, but many firms can begin to solve their marketing issues by first determining which reason is causing the issue and then fixing the right problem. For instance, if you do a lot of public seminars but are not seeing corresponding sales results, you may want to just stop doing them.</p><p> I received a call from a financial advisor early last month with a &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; issue regarding the public workshops he was hosting. He had people attending his workshops, he received high evaluations on the seminar presentations, and 75% said they would like more information or a meeting. However, very few ever turned into an appointment or a sale. He was convinced that the wrong people were attending the seminars for the topics he was presenting.</p><p> Crazy enough, after talking with his staff, the reason was right in front of him. His two staff people responsible for scheduling appointments after a workshop were swamped with their day-to-day work and didn&rsquo;t begin calling to schedule appointments until almost one week after the event. By that time there is no doubt that the interest had waned.  <strong>  Conclusion: People problem.  </strong></p><p> In another case an advisor was sending out a regular email newsletter. It went out like clockwork executed by his staff. The content was well written and provided to him through a reputable service he subscribed to. But he felt like nothing was happening since he started sending out the email newsletter six months earlier &ndash; no comments, calls, appointments, etc. After he took a hard look at the analytics on who was opening his email newsletter, it became clear that very few people were even opening his newsletter called &ldquo;Retirement Talk.&rdquo; Could the fact that the majority of his email list was comprised of business owners and executives explain this low open rate? It was determined that these individuals were not seeing themselves in retirement yet, so they weren&rsquo;t even opening his email. He then selected a different email newsletter from his provider that he called &ldquo;Financial Smarts for Entrepreneurs and Professionals&rdquo; and his open rate doubled and continues to go up.  <strong>  Conclusion: Strategy problem. </strong></p><p> You may be thinking that these issues are so simple and obvious. And they are. Almost rudimentary. But they happen ALL THE TIME! So, try thinking about marketing in a simpler way. The answer is often right there.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Not sure where to start in building some solid team hatred? These 5 easy tips will definitely put you on the right path.</p><h3> Take credit for everything.</h3><p> <br/> Except the failures, of course. Blame those on your team. Or even better, blame them on individual members of your team to make sure they don&rsquo;t get too confident and full of themselves.</p><p> But everything else? Yeah, that was all you, baby. Even the stuff your team accomplished while you were on vacation or traveling to that conference out of state. Because your brilliance is so great that they couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you at the top.</p><h3> Turn people against each other.</h3><p> <br/> It is always dangerous when a team grows too united. If you let the monkeys trust each other they might band against you. So keep them off balance. Make them think a co-worker is gunning for their job. Drop hints that someone they thought was a friend is actually talking behind their back. You know, just basic doubt-sowing.</p><p> Make sure that everyone on the team feels that YOU are their safe zone, but that they can&rsquo;t trust the guy at the desk next to them. That way you retain power over their small minds.</p><h3> Rewrite the minutes after the vote.</h3><p> <br/> Who&rsquo;s really going to remember the nuances of what was voted at committee meetings, anyway? If it didn&rsquo;t go exactly how you wanted it, adjust your secretary&rsquo;s notes to suit your plans as team leader before sending out the minutes. Better yet, wait until the minutes have been sent out and approved by the team, then edit the file before saving it so that there&rsquo;s no questions later.</p><p> If anyone asks you about it, remind them that you are the boss and all the responsibility falls on you to make things happen around here, so it&rsquo;s not their problem.</p><h3> Constantly change up assignments/duties.</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t bother with minor details like maximizing your team&rsquo;s strengths, or worrying about which of your monkeys is better at which type of work. Just randomly assign duties to whomever is standing closest to you when you&rsquo;re thinking about it. Or give it to whomever is prettiest. That works too.</p><p> Later, take the assignment away before the job is done and put someone else on it. Don&rsquo;t give explanations or reasons. If anyone questions your authority, remind them that you&rsquo;re the only one who can see the big picture. You&rsquo;re the boss so it&rsquo;s your call.</p><h3> Drop last minute rush jobs on your team. All. The. Time.</h3><p> <br/> Planning ahead is for sissies. If you always stick to a timeline, your team will get complacent and lazy. Mix it up &mdash; often. If your team somehow tricks you into getting a timeline established for the jobs they are working on, let them keep their illusions for a week or two and then drop some huge last-minute rush jobs on them.</p><p> Tell your team to shelve their current duties in order to accomplish their rush jobs, and then criticize them later for not keeping up with what they were originally working on. When they remind you that you had told them to put normal duties on pause, act like they are being manipulative and showing lack of dedication.</p><p> If your goal is to make your team united in their desire to leave, or maybe even wish they were dead, these are guaranteed to foster deep loathing and make you a common enemy.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Mass advertising can help build brands, but authenticity is what makes them last. If people believe they share values with a brand, they will stay loyal to the brand.</h3><p> Howard Schultz, CEO, Starbucks</p><p> If anyone knows how to build a brand, it&rsquo;s Howard Schultz. From a single Starbucks location in 1987 to 21,366 Starbucks stores around the world in 2014, Schultz has managed to scale a business without losing sight of the values it was born from. A glance at the Starbucks mission statement shows their bigger goal: To inspire and nurture the human spirit &ndash; one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. Not everyone agrees with their market dominance but they have become an essential brand to those aligned with their values. Values such as &ldquo;Acting with courage, challenging the status quo and finding new ways to grow our company and each other&rdquo;.</p><p> When Schultz returned to the company in 2008 after an eight year break, he did so because he believed that the company was losing it&rsquo;s soul and losing sight of its values. To remedy this, he closed every single store worldwide for 3 hours to realign staff with their core mission and train all staff how to pour the perfect espresso. It was his belief that only by being the best in the world at what they do and staying true to their values could the company grow. He wasn&rsquo;t wrong. That same year (2008), you could pick up a single share of Starbucks stock (SBUX) for the price of a venti macchiato at around $7. The stock closed yesterday at $94. A 1200% increase. That argument about values not having a financial value just went up in smoke, didn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> Starbucks today remains true to the values it was founded upon. It offers healthcare plans to any employee, hourly or salaried, working more than 20 hours per week and at a shareholder meeting in 2013, Schultz dug in his heels about gay marriage after an investor complained that the company&rsquo;s support was eroding its bottom line.</p><p> &ldquo;If you feel respectfully that you can get a higher return [than] the 38% you got last year, it&rsquo;s a free country,&rdquo; said Schultz. &ldquo;You could sell your shares at Starbucks and buy shares in other companies.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just Schultz that understand the value of values &ndash; a study conducted by Millward Brown over 10 years of 50,000 brands found the same thing to be true: The study, which forms the backbone of  <u>  GROW: How Ideals Power Growth and Profit at the World&rsquo;s Greatest Companies </u> , establishes a cause and effect relationship between a brand&rsquo;s ability to serve a higher purpose and its financial performance. Notably, investment in these companies &ndash; the Stengel 50 &ndash; over the past decade would have been 400% more profitable than an investment in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p> To further explore if and how ideals impact consumer attitudes, Millward Brown&rsquo;s Neuroscience team devised a method to uncover the implicit associations that people make between brands and ideals. This custom research provided insights into the types of associations activated in people&rsquo;s minds by the Stengel 50 brands and their competitors. The research uncovered the extent to which these high-growth brands touch on the five fields of fundamental human values identified in  <strong>  GROW: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Eliciting Joy: </strong>  Activating experiences of happiness, wonder, and limitless possibility</li><li> <strong>  Enabling Connection: </strong>  Enhancing the ability of people to connect with each other and the world in meaningful ways</li><li> <strong>  Inspiring Exploration: </strong>  Helping people explore new horizons and new experiences</li><li> <strong>  Evoking Pride: </strong>  Giving people increased confidence, strength, security, and vitality</li><li> <strong>  Impacting Society: </strong>  Affecting society broadly, from challenging the status quo to redefining categories <br/>  </li><p> If you&rsquo;re still building a company on your &ldquo;How&rdquo; and your &ldquo;What&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s time to re-evaluate whether it&rsquo;s in the best interests of your customers or your company to avoid aligning your ideals and world view with your customers well documented needs and buying behavior.</p>",

    "content": "To become a powerful leader who can navigate your organization into the future,<strong> you need to understand who you are and have fluency with yourself so you can have greater influence in the world at large.</strong><br/> <h3> My clients ask me how to be a better leader. I say: be a better you.</h3><p> <br/> What makes you a better person? Who gets to judge who&rsquo;s a better person? The answer is: <strong>  Only you do. </strong></p><p> You are the only judge that matters. You get to measure yourself by your own standards. You can compare yourself to others if you like, but essentially, that&rsquo;s a useless exercise. Everyone is different, and everyone has a different standard of who they are. No one gets to judge you unless you allow them.</p><h3> Consider a different question: Are you a leader of your life?</h3><p> <br/> When you are a leader of your life it is a journey, a process that unfolds over time. I&rsquo;ve spent the better part of 35 years getting to know who I am, and I&rsquo;ve found that I like who I have become, and I share that openly with those I have the pleasure of connecting with.</p><p> I think of it as journey into a forest. It&rsquo;s filled with unknowns and uncertainty, and during your journey of getting to know yourself, you will confront strong emotions. You will be afraid. You will have moments when you don&rsquo;t know who you are, or what to do, and you will make it up as you go along so make some good choices.</p><p> You will also discover the unimaginable potential that exists within you: your greatness. Other people will notice it too, and they will want a part of it. Others will want to follow you, and to share in your greatness because it casts a shadow on them. <strong>  It&rsquo;s the spirit of influence that informs everything you do. </strong></p><p> Recently, I made up a new word. It&rsquo;s called InnerFluence and it&rsquo;s pretty simple. When you are fluent with yourself (the inner part), you will have more influence in the world at large. More importantly, you will live the life you were destined to live. A life of fulfillment and satisfaction knowing you made a difference in the lives of those you touched, and you have left a legacy of strength, courage and inspiration.</p><p> <strong>  Being conscious of who you are and how you walk through the world is the foundation of a well-lived life. </strong></p><h3> This is also conscious leadership.</h3><p> <br/> I have currently written 6 books, sung in front of hundreds of people, earned a black belt in karate, and on my way to earning a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I&rsquo;ve also raised my children, traveled and lived in several countries, started my own enterprise, and presented my work to some of the biggest companies in the United States. I have had massive influence through any one of these outlets.</p><p> I have also established myself as a credible expert with my clients, with strong leadership skills, and I know I am capable of fulfilling any vision I put my mind to. I also trust that I can handle whatever comes my way, even if I occasionally feel self-doubt and trepidation about undertaking something new.</p><p> I have done all of this because I know who I am and what I want. I&rsquo;m sure some of you reading this can relate to this, and if you do, you are in the small percentage of individuals who take their growth seriously. The truth is, we are all life-long learners, and the minute you stop learning, the game is over. There&rsquo;s a pine box waiting for you somewhere.</p><p> There is no doubt in my mind that the people who invest in their growth, who develop their skills, talents and experience to build credibility, will gain far more influence and success than those who don&rsquo;t. These are the people who are dedicated to being a better person, so they can give generously as a better leader.</p><p> The world needs strong leaders now more than ever. Many of our organizations and institutions are broken, and we need good people to help fix them. Taking on the responsibility to influence others effectively is the task all good people should rise to.</p><p> Become the leader you want to be: one who inspires and motivates through sharing your vision, and who influences the people around you to open up to their vision and rise to being more than they thought they could be.</p><p> After all, isn&rsquo;t that what we all want at the end of our days: To know we made a difference? To know that we made a contribution to the lives of others?</p>",

    "title": "Change is Bad",
    "link": "change-is-bad",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Okay, so I&rsquo;m going to start by admitting that my heading was a &lsquo;hook&rsquo; to get you into this post. Here&rsquo;s the deal; the notion that &ldquo;change is bad&rdquo; is blasphemy in today&rsquo;s world of business. In fact, change is one of the most proliferated subjects in blogs, books, and social media chats. I understand why, and so do you; change is vital to progress in every field of endeavor. Without change, stagnation sets in. This explains why it is so easy for people to become caught up and desensitized by the &ldquo;change is good&rdquo; paradigm. Well, change is not always good. Change can be bad. Very bad. </p><p> There are plenty of examples where radical change has either destroyed a company or brought it to its knees. Coca-Cola&rsquo;s 1985 decision to change its time-honored formula is the biggest blunder in corporate history. New Coke lasted 79 days before the original formula returned to the market. Kudos to CEO Roberto Goizueta for having the good sense, (and the courage) to &ldquo;kill his darling&rdquo; and reinstate Coke Classic.</p><p> So yes, with change comes good choices and bad choices. More importantly, change should not consume every aspect of a business at the same rate or to the same degree. Leaders ought to be wary about bringing change to vibrant cultures, the positioning of brands, and effective business models.</p><h3> Would You Change the Culture of Google or Zappos?</h3><p> <br/> I consider Google a tier-one innovator. This company is constantly searching for revolutionary new products and services. Concurrently, Google relentlessly works at upgrading its workplace and its workforce to facilitate exponential growth. This initiative isn&rsquo;t change. It&rsquo;s improvement.</p><p> At Zappos, CEO Tony Hsieh has set his cultural sights on a  <u>  holacracy management system </u>  a radical change from conventional structures. Is Zappos there yet? No. Despite Hsieh&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the rate of change, he views holacracy as the starting point. Hsieh is still hell-bent on achieving a world of self-management and self-organization, but not through more cultural changes, through quicker evolution of that initial change.</p><p> Change and continuous improvement happen to be inherent in the Google and Zappos DNA. Said another way, change is the status quo.</p><h3> When Should a Brand&rsquo;s Positioning Change?</h3><p> <br/> By nature, marketing people are dynamic and impatient. They love to put their mark on the brands under their roof. This leads to change for change&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen time and time again. Package graphics and advertising campaigns change far too often. So does core  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/positioning.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   brand positioning  </a> </u> . Changing brand positioning is usually premature and almost always a mistake.</p><p> Okay, you might say, what about the argument that &ldquo;we should fix a brand before it breaks.&rdquo; Not when it comes to positioning. A change in a brand&rsquo;s promise confuses customers. Confused consumers are a brand&rsquo;s kiss of death. You &ldquo;fix brands before they break&rdquo; with innovations that add value and fortify the brand&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre.</p><p> Twenty years ago, Nestl&eacute; could see that the instant coffee market was broken. They didn&rsquo;t tinker with advertising or positioning to reverse the downward slide of the category or their brands. Nestl&eacute; turned to product innovation to fulfill the convenience needs of coffee lovers. They found a novel way to deliver great coffee, instantly. Nespresso did not take Nestl&eacute; outside of its core competence or its strategic brand positioning; the breakthrough into single-serve pod machines enhanced the positioning, (and delivered $5+ billion in annual revenues).</p><h3> When Should You Revamp Products and Services?</h3><p> <br/> Leaders with great foresight know when to change a business model, but few have the courage to do it when everything seems hunky-dory. Procrastinators with weak backbones avoid making the tough call and end up like Blockbuster Video, Borders, Kodak, and JC Penny &ndash; bankrupt or near to it. </p><p> You likely wouldn&rsquo;t consider the retailer, Target anywhere close to these shadows of their former selves. Neither would I until I witnessed Target&rsquo;s recent entry into Canada. Target crossed the 49thparallel with a lot of fanfare. Canadian shoppers welcomed the chain with open arms because they had enjoyed shopping at Target in the USA. But, Canadians didn&rsquo;t find that particular Target on Canadian soil. Target decided to &ldquo;change for Canada&rdquo; with a much different product assortment, and higher prices. Within two years, the retailer threw in the towel, closing a 133 stores and putting 17,000 employees out of work. This was a $5 billion mistake. Target thought change would be good thing. Not so.</p><p> As a management principle, change ought to be the status quo. When leaders have made the daring calls and worked hard to make them successful, they no longer fear the unknown. Their eagerness to find the next breakthrough bubbles to the surface and it becomes contagious. Why? Because the right change at the right time and the right place, gets their companies to the future first. </p><p> For more on transformational leadership and change management, check out my new book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Do-Less-Better-Strategic-Sacrifice/dp/1137452773/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421697776&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Do+Less+Better\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Do Less Better: The Power of Strategic Sacrifice in a Complex World  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "title": "What Do Your Employees Know About Customer Experience?",
    "link": "what-do-your-employees-know-about-customer-experience",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I've been talking about the importance of employees to the customer experience since my days at J.D. Power and Associates 20 years ago; sadly, in the heat of customer experience design efforts, employees are still forgotten. Company executives say: \"We'll collect feedback from employees later. We'll incorporate employee input after we hear how our customers feel. We&rsquo;ll do something for employees next year. We&rsquo;ll think about our culture at another time. Let's start with customers.\" This is not in any way, shape, or form acceptable. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Without your employees, you have no customer experience. </strong> The linkage between employee engagement and customer experience has been  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/12/this-trumps-customer-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   proven  </a> </u> . It's real, and your employees matter! If your employees aren't engaged with your improvement efforts or engaged overall with the organization, it will be very difficult for them to delight your customers; in very simple terms, this describes  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Spillover%20Effect\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the spillover effect  </a> </u> , defined as &ldquo;the tendency of one person&rsquo;s emotions to affect how other people around him feel.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> So, let's think about this for a second. <strong>  Employees are critical to the customer experience, which is critical to the success of the business. </strong> But what tools do we give to employees to prepare them to deliver a great customer experience? I wrote previously about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/09/6-tools-to-create-clear-line-of-sight.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   six tools to ensure employees have a clear line of sight to customers  </a> </u> . I'm sure there are others. <br/> <br/> Those tools are helpful, no doubt. But let's think back even further:  there seems to be a step missing. Perhaps there's a precursor to all of those tools. Perhaps we need to understand our employees a bit better. Perhaps we need to find out what they know about customers and customer experience before we can offer up tools and training. <br/> <br/> When consulting with a client, we typically perform a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/03/cem-toolbox-setting-stage-for-voc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   current state assessment  </a> </u>  of the organization to determine just that: where is the organization today in terms of its customer experience efforts and where are the gaps that need to be filled in order to (begin to) transform the experience and the organization. Having this information allows us to create a roadmap for the work that lies ahead. <br/> <br/> What if we did an  <strong>  employee CX assessment </strong>  at the same time? What if we asked employees what they know about customers and the customer experience? We then use the results to better frame our training efforts and to provide other (the right) tools needed to ensure employees have a clear line of sight to customers and are equipped to deliver the experience we need (and customers want) them to deliver. <br/> <br/> I've used just such an assessment. It includes questions like:</p><li> How do you define \"customer?\"</li><li> Who are your customers? </li><li> What are your customers trying to achieve when they interact with you?</li><li> How do you deliver value to your customers?</li><li> How do you define \"customer experience?\"</li><li> Do you know what it means to deliver a great experience for your company? </li><li> Do you know the difference between \"customer service\" and \"customer experience?\"</li><li> Do you know the company's brand promise, vision, customer experience vision?</li><li> And more... <br/>  </li><p> Once we have the answers to this assessment, we can begin to build out an adoption, training, and ongoing education plan for employees and put together the tools and information they'll need to deliver a great customer experience. Why? Because (a) we know what we need to teach them, and (b) they'll then have a solid foundation based on what they currently know, not on what we think they know.   <br/> <br/> By the way, this assessment doesn't necessarily just apply to frontline or back-office employees. It's an effective tool for understanding what executives know and don't know, as well. The key here is that this assessment allows us to develop tools and programs that help us ensure that everyone in the organization is on the same page and has the same level of knowledge and understanding about who the customer is and what it means to deliver a great experience. <br/> <br/> I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing; and that is that I know nothing. -Plato</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  There are 3 ways financial advisors sabotage their businesses: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1) Do nothing. </strong> Just coast along with the markets and seemingly happy clients. And hope the next bump in the road doesn&rsquo;t throw your business back into the depths of the 2008 meltdown. That&rsquo;s wishful thinking&hellip;a recipe for disaster.</p><p> <strong>  2) Shelf Help. </strong> Advisors attend webinars, sit-in on free lunches, go to conferences and maybe throw a few backs a training program. But then they do absolutely nothing with the things they learn. The trouble with that is obvious.</p><p> <strong>  3) Pink Floyd Starvation. </strong> &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t eat yer meat, you can&rsquo;t have any pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don&rsquo;t eat yer meat?&rdquo; This happens a lot. This story will explain what I mean:</p><p> Back in my early days as an advisor, I was quick learner. Show me a good way to grow my business and the next week I had it done. I was always among the top producers and innovators in my peer group.</p><h3> The &rsquo;87 crash wasn&rsquo;t fun&hellip;but it didn&rsquo;t stop me from growing.</h3><p> <br/> But a few years later, I hit the inevitable plateau. Growth ground to a standstill. And I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find a solution. Given the &ldquo;ego&rdquo; I had developed, I felt like a loser even though my business was still the envy of others.</p><p> So I decided to &ldquo;reinvent&rdquo; my business&hellip;from top to bottom.</p><p> I bought, consumed and digested more information than any one human could possibly find useful. Before I knew it, I had the best &ldquo;business plan&rdquo; imaginable. A big lumpy, step-by-step guide to take my business to unimaginable levels.</p><p> One problem&hellip;plans don&rsquo;t produce results, actions do.</p><p> At that time, no one or no thing could distract me from my mammoth plan for massive growth. Even though I was choking on all the hours I was working. Even though I was still stuck on the same damn plateau. Pink Floyd was playing in the back of my mind&hellip;</p><h3> &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t eat yer meat, you can&rsquo;t have any pudding.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> In other words, dinner must come before dessert. I had abandoned my instincts for staying in motion. A tedious, mind-numbing &ldquo;do it all&rdquo; attitude was crippling my business.</p><p> In truth, I was starving the fuel that had fired my success.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not how elite advisors really work. The markets, new business opportunities and client needs dictate the constant digestion of new ideas. Gobble up the best and discarded the rest.</p><p> Who cares if you eat the pudding before the meat?</p><p> Sure, you need a clear vision, a passion for being the best and the right amount of discipline&hellip;but they need your energy. They require action. Action based on accomplishing your most important priorities.</p><p> Think of it as the 80/20 of personal productivity.</p><p> Thankfully, I stopped walking that plank. I quickly realized that 10 to 20 percent of my ideas were having the biggest impact on the most important parts of my business. So I cherry-picked the best ideas from my mammoth plan. And BOOM&hellip;I went on to have my best month and quarter and year ever.</p><h3> Lesson learned&hellip;plateau in the rear view mirror.</h3><p> <br/> What&rsquo;s the moral to this story? If you are in motion, if you&rsquo;re not just sitting around hoping the good times will last&hellip;.If your ideas are turning into actions and not just collecting dust, then please:</p><p> <strong>  Enjoy the pudding. Don&rsquo;t starve the energy that drives your business. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Social media is everywhere these days.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t hide from it or ignore it any longer.  It&rsquo;s become ingrained in our news, shopping practices, and ways we keep in touch with family and friends. And you&rsquo;re okay with that, but when it comes to utilizing it for your business &ndash; it&rsquo;s a totally different subject.</p><p> You probably don&rsquo;t even know where to start. Or you have been working REALLY hard at it for a while now, but haven&rsquo;t seen any results. In fact, you&rsquo;re probably still calling malarky on the whole she-bizz.</p><p> You aren&rsquo;t alone. Many business owners are struggling with social media, and there&rsquo;s lots of different avenues to take. You can enroll in a course, hire your sister&rsquo;s son (who must know what social media is), get a friend to help, or try to educate and incorporate it yourself. But none of this seems to help. </p><p> For the majority of people, trying to do social media themselves will land them in the midst of frustration and anxiety because they don&rsquo;t know how to balance learning and implementing social media while running their businesses.</p><p> That&rsquo;s a LOT to do!</p><p> <strong>  That&rsquo;s why social media agencies are your best option. </strong>  And I don&rsquo;t just say that because I own one, I say it because it&rsquo;s true.</p><p> I grew up in family-owned businesses, my family is still mostly comprised of entrepreneurs, and most of my friends own businesses, too. I&rsquo;m hip to what owners are dealing with everyday, and I know how heavy social has become for the majority of them.</p><p> But if you&rsquo;re still struggling to believe that an agency is your best bet, here&rsquo;s 3 of my biggest reasons why you should hire a social media agency.</p><h3> 1. Get Your Focus Back</h3><p> Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; how much work are you getting done these days? Are you able to get online to promote something without getting distracted by alllllll the buttons and pictures and links and things you could click on? Are you able to focus on the most important aspects of your business &ndash; producing more products or perfecting your service?</p><p> If you say no, you aren&rsquo;t alone. Hey &ndash; even for marketers online everyday, social distraction is a REAL thing. But the difference is that our distraction plays into what we&rsquo;re doing everyday, whereas yours is keeping you from bettering your business, managing a staff, keeping your accountant accountable or spending down time with your family and friends.</p><p> You shouldn&rsquo;t be concerning yourself with having to learn and implement social media &ndash; it&rsquo;s not your specialty. Your gift to this world is something different and to be successful at it, you should be giving whatever that is, your total focus.</p><p> I joke with my clients and prospects over the fact that I have a job because business owners have their own job &ndash; if they could do everything, how would I be able to help?</p><p> But the bottom line is, social media is my specialty, while theirs is managing a company, creating a product, or finessing their service.  <strong>  They hire me because they want to restore their focus to doing what they do best. </strong></p><h3> 2. Social media is a necessity</h3><p> In 2012, you could have gotten away with bypassing social media, but you definitely can&rsquo;t now.</p><p> Even if you have a brick &amp; mortar business that&rsquo;s been successful for decades, you&rsquo;re starting to notice that your competition &ndash; who is utilizing social marketing &ndash; is getting a bigger piece of the pie. Or maybe you&rsquo;re just realizing that your business is becoming stagnant, you aren&rsquo;t growing.</p><p> That&rsquo;s because EVERYONE is online now. Not just the cool kids, not just the youngsters &ndash; everyone. The largest growing demographic online is currently those ages 45+, and those people have money to spend!</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t online and actively involved in social media marketing then you are losing out on MAJOR business growing activities.</p><p> And furthermore, I&rsquo;ve predicted  <u>  <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/3-musts-for-social-media-in-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this before  </a> </u>  &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t get involved in the social media game in 2015 then you will be on the fast track to becoming obsolete.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t say that to scare you, but I do say that to scare you. Social media covers all aspects of marketing these days &ndash; email marketing, content creation (blogging, videos, photos, etc), and social marketing, and you must, you must, YOU MUST play if you want to maximize your business&rsquo;s growth.</p><h3> 3. Consistency is key</h3><p> Social media is a bigger job than you thought.</p><p> Not only do you need to stay on top of social network updates, trends, tools and strategies &ndash; you have to implement them.</p><p> That means culminating a list of excellent resources to add value to your fans and followers, create visual content to entice and entertain them (photos, quotes, videos, etc), figure out the best days and time to reach the most people, locate where your beloved audience is hanging out, continually spread the seed of your message across all social platforms and in many places across the web, stay on top of your brand mentions, write blogs to establish credibility and present yourself as a thought leader, and, and, and.. see where I&rsquo;m going with this??</p><p> AND we haven&rsquo;t even touched on the MOST important part of social &ndash; engaging, creating interaction, and developing relationships!!</p><p> ALL of these things and many I don&rsquo;t even mention require that you are able to CONSISTENTLY do them &ndash; ALL of them. That takes major commitment and that requires your constant attention.</p><p> It means that no matter what is happening in your life &ndash; you need to show up,  <strong>  consistently </strong> . Doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re sick, or on vacation or having a baby &ndash; social media success is about momentum and credibility, and not showing up consistently means your audience won&rsquo;t either.</p><p> That is why you&rsquo;ll see brands with a large audience that doesn&rsquo;t have much engagement &ndash; they&rsquo;re posting schedule is all over the place. They don&rsquo;t reply to folks who engage. And they&rsquo;re only sharing promotional content. They aren&rsquo;t training their fans and followers to show up because they aren&rsquo;t.</p><p> This should be the  <strong>  MOST compelling reason </strong>  for you to hire a social media agency out of all of them.</p><p> Marketers work when we&rsquo;re sick, when babies are being born (seriously know someone who didn&rsquo;t let up), when hazardous weather occurs, when they don&rsquo;t want to and when we don&rsquo;t feel like it. We are professionals who are paid to do a job, and if we&rsquo;re doing it correctly &ndash; consistency will standout in everything we do.</p><p> Look &ndash; some business owners are willing and able to take on social media on their own and they&rsquo;re doing a great job, BUT that is the major minority.</p><p> In my own business, I&rsquo;ve realized that the more I can outsource, the faster I will grow my business &ndash; why? Because then I get to focus on doing what I&rsquo;m best at!</p><h3> Do you handle social for your business or have you hired it out to a social media professional?</h3>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timbdesignmpls\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tim Brown  </a> </u> | <a href=\"https://timbdesign.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tim B. Design  </u> </a>  </p><p> <strong>  Long-form content is taking over. These are the pages on your website that provide a great deal of information on one single subject. They establish you as an informational resource on said subject. The official number of words required varies, but I like to say that these content pieces have at least 1,500+ words. </strong>  When I tell clients they need these kinds of assets on their website, I brace myself and watch their eyes bug out. Then the excuses start. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t look right on my website.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;my customers don&rsquo;t want to read that much.&rdquo; In this case, they&rsquo;re usually right. Customers don&rsquo;t want to read that much. They have notoriously short attention spans. In fact, most of you may have already stopped reading this blog post, save a few of my biggest fans. (Hi, Mom!)</p><p> But you know who likes reading all those words on your website? Google. And if you ever want people to find you, you need Google on your side. The simple truth is that without all those words on your page, Google doesn&rsquo;t have any way of knowing what your site is about.* When this happens, you&rsquo;ll never rise in search results and forever be on page 10 or higher with the rest of the spam. Or worse, never indexed at all. Don&rsquo;t believe me?  <strong>  SerpIQ conducted a   <u>   research study in 2012  </u>   and concluded that the top performing search results each contained well over 2,000 words per page. I bet that 1,5000 is sounding pretty good, now. </strong></p><h3> <img alt=\"\" height=\"398\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-27-at-12.05.30-PM.png\" width=\"699\"/> <br/> Why should you take my word for it?</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to writing, I get to call myself an expert. My sister was the first one to tell me that I should be a writer one day, and I heard it more and more as I got older. It wasn&rsquo;t until college was over and no one was making me write anything that I realized I actually liked doing it. I can proudly say that my claim to fame is the first long-form blog post I ever wrote as a mere intern. At this point in time it has over 1,700 social shares. (It&rsquo;s currently ranking at the middle of the second page for &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.snapagency.com/blog/10-tips-skyrocket-pinterest-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pinterest ecommerce sales  </a> </u> ,&rsquo; so keep linking, people.) Never you mind that most of the posts I&rsquo;ve written subsequently have just bounced around between mainly my family, friends, and co-workers.</p><p> I get a lot of questions about how to write such lengthy content pieces. It&rsquo;s not nearly as hard as people initially assume. My way is definitely not the only way, it&rsquo;s probably not even be the best way. I give you a long form blog post about how to write a long-form blog post.</p><h3> Step One: Plan It Out</h3><p> It&rsquo;s like going to the gym, half the challenge is just getting there. So when you&rsquo;re looking at that blank sheet of paper and starting to regret your decision, remember that the world is at your fingertips. You&rsquo;re doing a wonderful thing for yourself, and for anyone who will read what you&rsquo;re about to create. Let&rsquo;s get started.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s best to begin with your &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; sections. </strong>  I generally find myself breaking up long-form pieces into five main ideas. <br/> <strong>  What is your subject?  <br/>  Why do people care about your subject?  <br/>  What makes you an expert in your field?  <br/>  Why is your knowledge about your subject special?  <br/>  Now that people know more about your subject, how should they proceed? </strong> <br/>  </p><p> Boom. You now have five starting points that apply to pretty much any scenario. The first thing this strategy does is get you organized, but the real beauty is that your work load just got a lot lighter. Those daunting 1,500 words on one topic just turned into 300 words on 5 smaller, much more manageable subjects.</p><h3> More is Less</h3><p> <br/> If I&rsquo;m writing about a topic I don&rsquo;t know as much about, I&rsquo;ll aim for 10 main points instead. There&rsquo;s more leg work involved up front, but now have the lesser task of explaining each sub-point in 100 words, plus a short intro and conclusion. <br/>  </p><h3> &ldquo;It Wouldn't Look Right on my Website.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Lets say you make jewelry. Your website is your online portfolio, maybe one day you&rsquo;ll even build up to ecommerce. Your first instinct is probably to let your work speak for itself, but now you know that without awesome content, no one will be able to buy your beautiful merchandise.</p><p> The best way to decide what your big ideas should be is to follow the natural train of thought of your customers. What do they usually want to know? Talk about the history of your business, the different materials you use, or why your products are so unique. You know your customer better than anyone. Remember that if you&rsquo;re not passionate about your brand, they won&rsquo;t be either.</p><p> No matter what your topic of choice is, it&rsquo;s important that you&rsquo;re passionate about it. When you write from the heart, you write better. Trust me.</p><h3> Step Two: Fill In The Blanks</h3><p> I&rsquo;m going to assume that if you&rsquo;re going to commit the time to write 1,500 or more words about one topic, it&rsquo;s a topic that you&rsquo;re passionate about. When I&rsquo;m in this situation, thoughts start to flutter around in my head. Don&rsquo;t let them flutter. Assign them to one of your big idea sections and move on before you forget the next one.</p><p> At this point, it will be messy. You&rsquo;ll read your outline over and never be able to see how all these seemingly random points of thought could possibly ever fit together. If my process is anything to go by, that means you&rsquo;re doing it right.</p><h3> Step Three: Do Your Research</h3><p> Depending on what you&rsquo;re writing, this may or may not apply. Most of the time, though, it&rsquo;s a good idea to back your own thoughts up with quality evidence. Throw in some hard facts. Take this time to gather outside resources to back you up. You&rsquo;ve been stuck inside your head for the entire process. This is your brain break, and trust me, you&rsquo;ll need it. Quote your favorite industry expert, add a bullet point list here, a chart there, do whatever it takes to show that you&rsquo;re not the only one who has your opinion.</p><h3> Step Four: Flesh It Out</h3><p> This is without a doubt the toughest part of the entire process. You&rsquo;ll feel your determination start to slip away. You&rsquo;ll wonder how the first 12,000 words could be so easy and the last 300 are no where in sight. If you write your first drafts in Google docs like me, you&rsquo;ll probably start excessively using the word count tool. Yes, I just checked, and I am at 1,209.</p><p> What ever you do, don&rsquo;t stop writing. Jump around, have fun with it. Add a couple sentences to one section, then jump to the next one. The important thing is to just keep going. This is where you start to connect the dots. Before long, you&rsquo;ll have your very own &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; moment. Before your very eyes, you&rsquo;ll see your content piece begin to flow together, and soon you&rsquo;ll be typing the very last word. Take a moment to soak it all in. You did it! The worst is over.Step Five: Clean It Up (But Not Too Much)</p><p> Now is time for the fun part. Formatting! If step one was like getting to the gym, then this part is like remembering to stretch after your workout. If you try to put it off until later, you&rsquo;ll only end up hurting yourself. So have yourself a good long look at what you&rsquo;ve done, and make it look like the masterpiece it is. Throw in some headers, Images, split those paragraphs, go nuts. You&rsquo;ve earned it. Read it over once, make your changes, forward it to a few of your most trusted friends, and push that sucker live.</p><p> A word of caution here. If you&rsquo;re like me, your blog post will never be ready. You&rsquo;ll always find that one sentence you don&rsquo;t like any more. You&rsquo;ll notice two of the same word that are just too close together. Swapping a few phrases around will turn into a full paragraph rewrite. You may even begin to doubt that your post is worth all the time and effort you&rsquo;ve put into it. You&rsquo;ll wonder if your ideas are good enough to share.</p><p> My boss once told me that to be great, you also have to be vulnerable. If anyone ever tells you that writing a blog post isn&rsquo;t scary, they&rsquo;ve probably never written one. No matter what you&rsquo;re writing, taking words from your heart and putting them out there for the world to see is a daunting prospect. Writing for your business, no matter what your brand name represents, means taking your innermost passions and sharing them with everyone else. You have every right to be scared. So take a deep breath, be proud of what you&rsquo;ve done, and hit Publish.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The phrase &ldquo;bank run&rdquo; likely conjures up a black and white image of a Depression-era mob rushing the entrance of a generic, Roman-columned bank. Everyone wants their cash back, but the bank only has 10 percent or so on hand, creating increasingly vociferous demand to withdraw as panic spreads.</p><p> <strong>  Lately, regulators have wondered if money managers could be at risk of a similar &ldquo;run&rdquo; event if their clientele decided to redeem fund shares en masse. </strong> The fund would be forced to sell its underlying holdings, possibly at steep discounts, to free up cash for demanding clients. Investors would face even steeper discounts if willing buyers for a fund&rsquo;s underlying holdings were not readily available. Regulators are therefore examining the role of liquidity, or lack thereof, in the bond marketplace. Banks, the trading counterparties of major fund companies, are nowadays forced to limit holdings of risky debt in favor of safer assets to meet regulatory capital ratios. The unintended result is that banks no longer &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; the same trading inventory or take the same risk they used to just ten years ago.</p><p> The Economist points out that investment funds now hold 20 times as many bonds as banks, compared to only three times as many in the early 2000s, according to Federal Reserve data. Regulators are now evaluating whether stress-testing large investment firms, particularly with liquidity in mind, might provide additional insight into incremental risk that savers now bear. The Financial Times wrote that the debate over whether or not an asset manager should be declared &ldquo;systemically important&rdquo; is heating up.</p><p> Not surprisingly, some of the largest money managers disagree with proponents of additional regulatory scrutiny. BlackRock&rsquo;s head of fundamental credit says that although more corporate bonds have been issued as companies take advantage of cheap borrowing rates, things are very different than in 2006. Banks and households are less levered, and forced selling is not as likely as it was pre-Crisis. Vanguard&rsquo;s head of risk management similarly argues that his firm monitors liquidity regularly and does not expect a &ldquo;liquidity crunch.&rdquo;</p><p> Asset managers, including SNWAM, are taking steps to deal with reduced liquidity by breaking up orders into smaller pieces, trading less, focusing on short-dated holdings where liquidity is more readily available and cross-trading to limit the impact of redemptions. The Economist concludes, ominously, that less bond market liquidity is perhaps an acceptable trade-off to ensure a robust banking system. Although regulators still want to limit the potential for another taxpayer-funded bailout, it seems taxpayers will nonetheless pay the cost via additional risk in their portfolios.</p><p> This is not an ideal trade-off, though it may be the least worst option.</p>Sources: Federal Reserve, The Economist, FT, BlackRock, SNWAM Research",

    "content": "<p> Some time ago, I decided I wanted to greatly enhance my sales ability. I believe selling (stuff, ideas and yourself) is an important life skill everyone needs, especially business owners and entrepreneurs.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"158\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-28-at-8.05.08-AM.png\" width=\"408\"/></p><p> Many of the best techniques I researched revolved around the art of questioning. After immersing myself in learning them, I set about using them in numerous &ldquo;non-sales&rdquo; situations. At the time I was travelling a great deal, so I found myself engaging taxi drivers.</p><p> I deliberately made the effort to simply inquire. I used open-ended questions, did not attempt to build rapport by talking about myself or finding common ground, and combined it with a genuine desire not to achieve any aim other than understanding.</p><h3> The results were amazing.</h3><p> <br/> During that period, I went from having the kind of mundane, autopilot conversations we all drift through life having (&ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo; &ldquo;Fine, and you?&rdquo;), to finding out things about people&rsquo;s lives I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise discovered.</p><p> It reminds me of a word I was once introduced to. Sonder. It&rsquo;s a word of unclear origin, referring to &ldquo;the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own&mdash;populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness&mdash;an epic story in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, or as a blur of traffic passing on the highway&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a magical concept, presenting a world made of millions of layers of stories, individually more complex than even the most detailed novel.</p><h3> I found myself suddenly exposed to the tapestry of people&rsquo;s lives underneath the fa&ccedil;ade of day-to-day life.</h3><p> <br/> For a natural introvert like myself, the realisation of how simple it was to connect on this level was a true light bulb moment.</p><p> There are many theories of human motivation out there. I like Professor Steven Reiss&rsquo;s Intrinsic motivation and the 16 basic desires theory best. First proposed in the mid 90s and taken from studies involving more than 6,000 people, Professor Reiss proposed 16 core motivators that he believes drive all human behaviour.</p><li> Acceptance, the need for approval.</li><li> Curiosity, the need to learn.</li><li> Eating, the need for food.</li><li> Family, the need to raise children.</li><li> Honor, the need to be loyal to the traditional values of one&rsquo;s clan/ethnic group.</li><li> Idealism, the need for social justice.</li><li> Independence, the need for individuality.</li><li> Order, the need for organized, stable, predictable environments.</li><li> Physical activity, the need for exercise.</li><li> Power, the need for influence of will.</li><li> Romance, the need for sex and for beauty.</li><li> Saving, the need to collect.</li><li> Social contact, the need for friends (peer relationships).</li><li> Social status, the need for social standing/importance.</li><li> Tranquility, the need to be safe.</li><li> Vengeance, the need to strike back and to compete. <br/>  </li><p> If you subscribe to the theory that these are indeed the motivators of all human action, then they must also be the motivators of financial behavior.  The question I&rsquo;d like to ask you is; how many of these do you, as a financial adviser, assist with?</p><p> I believe the answer is all of them. The obvious ones are the need for security, saving, social status and even family. However, when you consider it further, you realise that even acceptance (providing a sounding board to validate decisions), romance (the ability to spend more quality time with loved ones) and revenge (some of the most success-motivated people I&rsquo;ve met have been driven in at least some small way by the desire to prove themselves in the face of those who may have done them wrong), I can&rsquo;t help reach the conclusion that financial advice is capable of adding value across all 16 desires.</p><p> The truth is that everyone is motivated by different things. Perhaps, whilst reading this, you&rsquo;re already thinking about those clients you know best and what their motivators might be.</p><p> It is in understanding these that you, as a trusted adviser, can help clients better understand their own personal motivators, in turn helping them take action that is genuinely in their own best interests.</p><p> This is at the core of great client engagement. The kind that enables advice businesses to win the right clients, paying appropriate fees, who remain engaged with your firm for years to come.</p><h3> It comes down to three things.</h3><li> Focusing not on price, or what you&rsquo;ll do, but instead the likely return on investment for the client, financial and otherwise.</li><li> Placing your entire emphasis on understanding what would best serve the needs or wants of the client, ahead of what you have to offer.</li><li> Building trust. <br/>  </li><p> The interesting thing about the third one is, when you a) implicitly seek to understand what someone wants to achieve BEFORE trying to suggest a solution, and b) focus on understanding someone&rsquo;s personal motivators, an interesting side effect occurs.</p><h3> That person often finds it easier to trust you.</h3><p> <br/> In the storm of negative press that seems to have no end, it&rsquo;s important that those who tend not to seek financial advice because that they don&rsquo;t really understand what advice is, are able to trust. Otherwise, how can you get them to a point where they are happy to take advice when they don&rsquo;t possess the knowledge to fully evaluate your solutions?</p><p> I believe that when you focus foremost on understanding the person before you, resisting the temptation to dive into solution mode and &lsquo;help&rsquo;, you become better equipped to understand how their desired outcomes can be achieved (or not, if you choose to make the call that you can&rsquo;t help). The client becomes more invested in taking that advice, meaning they are less likely to allow price to become an issue.</p><p> Because as I was once told, it&rsquo;s NEVER about price. It&rsquo;s ALWAYS about value.</p><p> Simply, one of the most common bad habits I see when conducting sales training is that of switching into solution mode too easily. It ends the two-way conversation dead. It changes the dynamic from the client talking, to the adviser seeking to explain what he or she can do. It also robs you, as an adviser, of the opportunity to experience your sonder moments.</p><p> The way to avoid that is simply to first seek to understand as much as possible BEFORE you get to a place where you suggest a solution.</p><p> With nothing more than the objective to understand, not only will you enjoy more sonder moments, but also what I suggest is a genuinely more enjoyable way to engage clients.</p>",

    "link": "earth-day-sustainability-and-good-news-for-business",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In a world where like-minded people across the globe are uniting to promote their common agendas, mindfulness about sustainability is not just a good idea for the environment, it&rsquo;s a good idea for business. Sustainable companies will be the winners in the 21st century. Will yours be among them?</p><p> Each year, Earth Day presents an ideal occasion for all of us as consumers, capitalists and producers to consider the far-reaching implications of our actions. As business leaders, shoppers and investors, we have a responsibility &ndash; and the opportunity &ndash; to make the planet better, safer and more sustainable.</p><p> Even if our choices only extend as far as the way we conduct our business and the people we choose to do business with, we can lay a foundation for lasting success that affects ourselves, our employees, our customers and our communities.</p><p> Earth Day was originally conceived by Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin (1916 &ndash; 2005) after a horrific oil spill near Santa Barbara, California in 1969. The following year, with help from Denis Hayes and Co-Chair U.S. Rep. Peter McCloskey of California, he organized the very first Earth Day event &ndash; attracting 20 million people across the U.S. Since then, the observance has expanded to all parts of the globe &ndash; with conferences, rallies, protests and social activism that has led to real world change.</p><h3> I have always felt a profound respect for the environment.</h3><p> <br/> Maybe that&rsquo;s because I have lived most of my life in a part of the U.S. renowned for its beauty and spaciousness. To me the earth has always seemed fragile, and I&rsquo;m continually amazed at its resilience &ndash; bouncing back as it so often does from the abuses it suffers at the hands of an ever &ndash; expanding human population.</p><p> I grew up and spent most of my career in Montana, a state of the U.S. whose early history was characterized by exploitation and extraction. With abundant natural resources and a sparse population, it was easy to overlook the then little understood damage being inflicted on the state by ambitious, sometimes ruthless men eager to reap the vast rewards of the industrial revolution. To this date, the state still suffers from the abuses inflicted in those days long ago.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s getting better. Spurred by citizens and responsive leaders, state and federal agencies are cleaning up generations of toxic messes. Rivers are being restored. Fisheries are recovering. Biodiversity is improving. At the same time, the economy has diversified and quality of life has improved. To me, this is a perfect metaphor for what&rsquo;s going on in business today. In fact, I think they overlap.</p><p> In 1970, long before digital media, everyday people by the millions were brought together by Earth Day to express their outrage at the damage being done to their planet. As a result of their activism, we now have the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act, the Water Quality Improvement Act, and other rules that have reversed generations of carelessness and wanton disregard for the planet.</p><h3> Today, hundreds of millions of people are joined together every day by media they control to share ideas they care about most.</h3><p> <br/> If Senator Nelson had had social media at his disposal in 1970, imagine the numbers that would have gathered around the globe to support the cause of sustainability.</p><p> Set within this framework of an enlightened, empowered consumer, I believe we&rsquo;re entering a golden age for business: A time when capital, great ideas and the best interests of humanity are all converging.</p><p> In the 21st century, consumers are choosing companies and products that speak to their higher selves. We want what we want, sure. And we want it now for a price that&rsquo;s fair. But we also expect companies to be fair &ndash; to consider the impacts of their actions. When we find a company is mistreating its people or the environment, there are consequences.</p><p> Today, scrutiny isn&rsquo;t the sole domain of the government or a press that is constrained or misled. It&rsquo;s us. We&rsquo;re watching. We&rsquo;re talking. And we care about what business is doing. The good news is this. If your company is just as concerned about the well being of its people and customers, you&rsquo;re probably perfectly positioned for success, a success that will last because it was built to last.</p><p> Seize the opportunities of this emerging reality. Give some serious thought to your company&rsquo;s sustainability. Make it a part of your story and your operational strategy. Consider your actions&rsquo; impacts on all your constituencies, and take steps where you can. Add instead of taking away. The 21st century marketplace will reward you.</p><p> Does your company have an opinion about sustainability? How is it practiced? Can you think of a company you admire because of its stance on the environment, fair-trade and supply chain integrity? How does it affect the choices you make as a shopper?</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "great-leaders-know-when-to-sharpen-the-axe",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> President Abraham Lincoln once said, &ldquo;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.&rdquo;</p><p> Business leaders can &ldquo;sharpen the axe&rdquo; of team performance by encouraging open and honest discussions about what their organizations need to continue, stop or start doing. A great leader knows when to take a step back from the hard-driving, stressful world of competition and the drive for results.</p><h3> Let me explain with an example:</h3><p> <br/> In mid-July, with vacations abounding, a CEO planned a four-day &ldquo;off-site&rdquo; meeting with her seven direct reports to align them better with her mission/vision, strategy, and with each other.</p><p> She scheduled sessions for business discussions and planning with the hope of getting her year-old executive team focused for the remainder of the year. The CEO also wanted to provide downtime in an environment where office protocols could be set aside, so she chose a spa in southern California for the off-site. There, activities such as daily massages, golf and sitting on the beach were available between morning and evening business meetings&mdash;an ideal venue for creating an atmosphere of collaboration, healthy nourishment, and open and honest dialogue.</p><p> The meeting date was announced two months prior and all were expected to attend, no exceptions. Some executives had to adjust personal schedules, but few, if any, voiced complaints. All seemed to realize this was an opportunity to learn more about one another and what had motivated each to join the team.</p><h3> The schedule for each day looked like this:</h3><li> Breakfast Business Meeting</li><li> Lunch (free time until dinner)</li><li> Dinner Business Meeting <br/>  </li><h3> Topics for Business Meetings:</h3><li> Performance to-date and projections for end-of-year <li>  What should we continue doing to support goals? </li> <li>  What should we stop doing that&rsquo;s not working well? </li> <li>  What should we start doing to support goals? </li></li><li> Staffing <li>  Stack ranking of individuals on each team </li> <li>  Human capital needs to support end-of-year projections </li></li><li> Training/Development <li>  ROI of current programs </li> <li>  Needs to support end-of-year projections </li></li><li> Benefits <li>  Level of investment anticipated for the coming year </li> <li>  ROI of &ldquo;Wellness&rdquo; program </li> <li>  Impact of new healthcare law </li></li><li> Performance Bonuses</li><li> End-of-year Celebration</li><p> <br/> Before the off-site, the CEO&rsquo;s sense was that business was good, people were productive and enjoyed working at the company, and the firm&rsquo;s culture was a competitive advantage. She was concerned, though, that the purpose for providing her firm&rsquo;s professional services to organizations in return for large monthly retainers was being lost.</p><p> During the very first meeting of the off-site, discussion was lively and everyone seemed engaged in conversation&mdash;but not in the conversation.</p><h3> Something was missing. There was no &ldquo;buzz.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The CEO sensed her team was simply going through the motions. As the session drew to a close, in a normal tone, without any announcement, she spoke the mission/vision of the organization. Some heads turned while others simply continued to pack up in anticipation of lunch and afternoon activities.</p><p> Thus, the CEO spent that first afternoon wondering if she had conned herself into thinking all was well when it was not. Her team liked the clients, the work they did and the salaries they were earning. But they seemed to lack the kind of excitement so often generated through collaboration.</p><p> Deciding to take action, for the remainder of the off-site, the CEO repeated the organization&rsquo;s mission/vision statement&ndash;reinforcing it&ndash;before and after each meeting.</p><p> By the end of four days, the CEO found they had spent more time than planned in business meetings and, much to her satisfaction, the team seemed more passionate as they actively generated ideas and solutions. She felt a shift in cohesiveness as team members expressed genuine concern and respect for one another.</p><p> While not all business leaders have the luxury of taking their teams away to prime locations for four days, great leaders have the ability to take their teams away from the office space to local hotels, restaurants, or other meeting places. Taking the time to &ldquo;sharpen the axe&rdquo; can reinvigorate a team. They gain clear action items, set goals to achieve, and leave the off-site with a greater sense of camaraderie.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

    "title": "Five Toxic Leadership Behaviors That Poison Culture",
    "link": "five-toxic-leadership-behaviors-that-poison-culture",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> &ldquo;Live or die, but don&rsquo;t poison everything.&rdquo; &mdash;Anne Sexton</p><h3> Leadership Behaviors</h3><p> <br/> What you, as a leader, do everyday has a ripple effect throughout your organization. This ripple impacts the culture of the organization and determines how things are done and the level of performance you get from your employees. Are you, as a leader, nurturing or poisoning your culture? Do your behaviors give the impression that you are micromanaging everything? Are you communicating effectively? Are you so focused on what needs to be done that you forget why you are even doing it? Have you developed relationships built on mutual trust or are you fostering distrust? Are you tearing down silos in your organization or are you reinforcing them? Learn to recognize and avoid these five toxic leadership behaviors that poison culture.</p><h3> Micromanagement</h3><p> <br/> Kris Carr tells us, &ldquo;Sometimes our need to control and micromanage everything erodes our confidence in ourselves and others. The truth: people are much more capable than we think.&rdquo; Micromanagement is the result of a lack of trust and a need to feel in control. When you micromanage, you undermine you employees&rsquo; confidence in their own abilities and stifle any growth or progress they have the potential to make. Employees who are being micromanaged become frustrated and begin wasting time and resources rather than delivering exceptional performance. This type of work environment destroys morale and engagement and poisons culture. Help your employees develop their skills and gain the experience necessary to become the best they can be. Learn to trust their abilities and allow them to do their jobs. When employees feel respected and appreciated they will become more productive, more loyal, and more engaged.</p><h3> Poor communication</h3><p> <br/> Yehuda Berg said, &ldquo;Words are singularly the most powerful force available to humanity. We can choose to use this force constructively with words of encouragement, or destructively using words of despair.&rdquo; Communication is at the heart of how you, as a leader, achieve your goals. The way you communicate can create strong connections and inspire trust or it can destroy trust, morale, and engagement. Are you using your communication to build others up or to tear them down? Be transparent in your communication. You can&rsquo;t know everything; ask questions, get clarification, and listen openly to the answers and suggestion your employees have to offer. Be collaborative, consider the perspective of others, and frame your communication to fit your audience. When your employees know there is open, two-way communication throughout the organization, they will be better informed and more inclined to share their knowledge and ideas.</p><h3> Focusing on what instead of why</h3><p> <br/> John F. Kennedy believed, &ldquo;Efforts and courage are not enough without purpose and direction.&rdquo; Are you focusing so much on what you do that you have forgotten why you are doing it? You can have a vision of the future that tells you where you are going but you and your employees need a purpose that tells you why you are going there. There is more to your purpose than the bottom line; it&rsquo;s not just about money, it has to be about making a difference. As a leader, you must make your purpose come alive for those who follow you; focus on the impact you want to have on the world. Your employees want to know that their work has meaning, that they are part of something bigger than themselves, something that matters. If you want a resilient organization that can stand the test of time you need a strong culture; this culture must be based on why, not what. Does everyone know why the organization exists? Where it is going? How it is going to get there? What role they play?  Focus your energy on the why and allow your employees to help you figure out and implement the what that will get you there.</p><h3> Lack of trust</h3><p> <br/> Eric Hoffer explained, &ldquo;Someone who thinks the world is always cheating him is right. He is missing that wonderful feeling of trust in someone or something.&rdquo; The most important attribute you can develop as a leader is the ability to inspire trust. Without developing mutual trust you cannot lead effectively; your culture will suffer and your employees will never reach their full potential. You must create a safe space for discussion, debate, and collaborative problem-solving. Learn to welcome the challenges, criticism, and conflicting opinions that employees have to offer. Let them know that you always have their back. Show that you are authentic in all your dealings. The level of trust you develop in your organization will either add to your ability to influence others of subtract from your authority and poison your culture.</p><h3> Us vs. them mentality</h3><p> <br/> Sharon Salzberg said, &ldquo;We can learn the art of fierce compassion &ndash; redefining strength, deconstructing isolation and renewing a sense of community, practicing letting go of rigid us-vs.-them thinking.&rdquo; An us vs. them mentality divides your team, undermines your strength, and destroys your culture. You are a team; don&rsquo;t let your position of authority lead you to believe you are better than anyone else. This mentality builds the silos that lead to ineffective collaboration, distrust, and a breakdown in communication. Be humble and recognize that none of you could do it on your own. Get rid of the us vs. them mentality and build trusting relationships and a sense of community throughout your organization.</p><h3> Nurture Culture</h3><p> <br/> What type of culture is your behavior as a leader developing? Have you developed your employees enough that you trust them to do their jobs without being micromanaged? Are your employees comfortable and even encouraged to challenge or question you? Does everyone in your organization know why they are doing what they do? Have you developed mutual trust throughout your organization? Do your employees work and collaborate as a cohesive team or have you allowed silos to be built? Pay attention to your behavior on a daily basis, I can guarantee that your employees are watching. Make sure your leadership behaviors are nurturing rather than poisoning your culture.</p>",

    "title": "Advisors: 6 Ways to Find and Attract Leads Using LinkedIn",
    "link": "advisors-6-ways-to-find-and-attract-leads-using-linkedin",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Looking for a few simple tweaks to gain exposure, increase your visibility, and attract new prospects using LinkedIn?  If so, this is the list for you. Modifying the way you use LinkedIn will change how prospects perceive and respond to you.</p><p> Here are six strategies to attract new leads to your firm.</p><h3> 1)  Create A Profile For Your Target Market</h3><p> <br/> Your profile should &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the people you are trying to sell your services and products. Include images and phrases explaining how you help your clients. Entice them to dig further by including calls to action directing your audience to sign up for your newsletter or to download a recent article you&rsquo;ve written. Once they provide their information, you&rsquo;ve gained a new prospect to move into your sales funnel.</p><h3> 2)  Optimize Your Headline (Your Headline IS NOT Your Title)</h3><p> <br/> Your headline is one of the most important components because it is seen by LinkedIn users without ever clicking on your profile. Anytime you show up in a search or make a comment on a post, your headline follows along with your name and photo. You can see in the example below how Andrea&rsquo;s headline appears in a LinkedIn search. Convey your value in your headline by stating what you do and who you serve.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-28-at-9.17.14-AM.png\" width=\"640\"/></p><p> Andrea&rsquo;s headline clearly states that she is a speaker, consultant, and coach for financial industry professionals. Here&rsquo;s a great example from one of the advisors we work with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a financial advisor helping women in transition.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3)  Write Your Summary In The 1st Person</h3><p> <br/> The summary section is a prime marketing opportunity! Write your summary in the first person and outline the services you offer and how you help solve client challenges. Prospective clients do not want to read your resume. They care more about what you can do for them rather than your background. While your skills and expertise are important, share that information in the experience section of your profile.</p><h3> 4)  Make Sure Your Profile Is Easy To Find</h3><p> <br/> LinkedIn doesn&rsquo;t tell us exactly how to optimize profiles. There are steps you can take to increase your rank in search results. Identify two to three phrases that clients would use to look for you in a search. The phrase should represent what you do and the services you offer.</p><p> Add these phrases to your profile in multiple locations such as your headline, summary, experience section, titles, skills, publications, honors and awards, and speaking engagements. Avoid the urge to get clever with your keywords &ndash; investors use common phrases such as: Financial Planner, Financial Advisor, and Wealth Manager when looking for someone like you. One of the advisors we work with uses  &ldquo;Financial Advisor specializing in retirement planning.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5)  Use Advance Search To Find Prospects</h3><p> <br/> LinkedIn&rsquo;s advance search feature gives you the ability to maintain an ongoing active search for new leads. Search for potential clients within your target market by identifying the titles, industry, and demographics of those in your target market. To broaden your search, add a Boolean operator and make sure to remove first-degree connections from your search parameters, since they are already in your network.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-28-at-9.14.45-AM.png\" width=\"549\"/></p><p> Save your search using the Saved Search function and LinkedIn will send you a weekly email when someone new fits the criteria you created. - See more at: http://www.ironstonehq.com/6-ways-to-find-and-attract-leads-using-linkedin/#sthash.sb6nJHRT.dpuf</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"91\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-28-at-9.14.37-AM.png\" width=\"563\"/></p><h3> 6)  Like &amp; Comment On Posts By Others</h3><p> <br/> Engage with your network. Watch for discussions of value and make comments on posts made by your clients, centers of influence, and group members. When you comment on a post, not only will your network see the comment, your reach will be extended to the network of the person who made the post, and the networks of anyone else who has engaged with that post. Once you establish conversations with others, reach out and connect with them provided they are relevant to your business; this will help grow your network organically.</p><p> LinkedIn is a goldmine for new clients. Commit 20 minutes each day to make a post of your own, comment on other posts, and use the advanced search feature. By investing a small amount of time and applying these strategies, you will be able to generate more leads and referrals.</p><p> And speaking of LinkedIn, join the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=6665094&amp;trk=my_groups-b-grp-v\" target=\"_blank\">   Ironstone &ndash; Financial Industry Professionals Practice Management Group  </a> </u>  for practice management tips and collaborate with your peers.</p>",

    "title": "How to Spot a Fake Digital Bank",
    "link": "how-to-spot-a-fake-digital-bank",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "I just heard a presentation from a leading American bank on the need to be digital.  This bank claims to be a digital leader in the US and, from all the PR and headlines, you would believe they were.  Listening to their presentation, you might believe it too:<li> Our CEO leads the digital charge</li><li> Digital is not an add-on</li><li> Digital is end-to-end</li><li> Being digital is crucial to our future</li><h3> Yada, yada, yada.</h3>The presenter then put a slide on screen that blew the whole credibility of his presentation (for me).This slide said that to be digital required a new organisational structure that is cross-functional, agile and able to operate in an omni-channel structure.First, you don&rsquo;t need a cross-functional organisation in a truly digital bank and, second, you never mention channel or omni-channel in a digital bank.My thinking on this is that I&rsquo;m calling for all banks in my digital bank presentation to firstly create a new digital business model, that moves away from the old physical structures to truly digital structures.  That business model operates as a value systems integrator, taking best of breed apps, APIs and cloud services and rebuilding them into incredible user experiences and capabilities for their targeted communities (digital banks talk about targeting communities, not customers).A criticality to being able to be agile in a digital structure of value systems integration however, is to be digital at the core, as I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://thefinanser.com/2015/04/banks-without-a-digital-core-will-fail.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> blogged often</a>.  This is where the first piece of credibility of many digital banks falls down. They&rsquo;re not digital at their core.  Their core is still stuck in legacy and heritage.  Hence why they talk about omnichannel.  There are no channels in digital banks because digital banks think of form factors accessing their digital core.  A form factor is a mobile or tablet; but equally can be a fridge or car; a call centre operator or a branch representative; or a customer walking payments on the net.  Any form of access to the digital core becomes a consistent experience, because there is ONE core.  When there is not one core, the bank has channels.  If the bank has channels, they are not digital because the channels create cracks and inconsistencies as you move from one to another.  At the back end are likely to be multiple systems that are purely integrated at the front-end through the lipstick on the pig.<h3> Therefore, unfortunately for this so-called digital bank, the first failure is talking about channels or omnichannel.</h3>The second is the use of the phrase cross-functional.  Cross-functional means that the bank not only has silo systems that need channels, but silo structures that need integration.  Silo structures based upon products and non-integrated interests of silo product leaders.A cross-functional approach implies matrix management; different interests; competitive internal structures; skewed rewards mechanisms; and all the other things that are issues of the legacy past.  A customer or, preferably, user- centric approach is what you expect to hear from a digital bank.  A digital bank organises around user-centricity through a digital outreach to their communities of interest.<h3> This is why digital banks focus upon the customer- / user- experience as their priority.</h3>This gets into another interesting discussion, in that most banks focus upon the experience through some internal team that reviews the bank&rsquo;s internet Content Management System (CMS).  Wrong.  User experience is end-to-end.  In fact, it builds on my blog the other day about the <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/04/rip-it-up-and-start-again-.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Cap Gemini survey</a>  discovering all these banks investing heavily for front-end experience, but doing nothing for the user-experience in their prioritisation of projects in the middle- or back- office.  That just does not cut the mustard and is like a general asking for more troops in the face of tanks attacking.  The bodies are there, but they&rsquo;ll just get run over.In summary and in future, I&rsquo;m going to judge digital banks as those that are doing it (user-centric with digital at the core) and will name check those that are just talking about it (cross-functional omnichannel banks).",

Our attorneys help families work through this difficult decision and draft documents to clarify their wishes in order to avoid unnecessary  <u>  legal proceedings </u>  and expense.</p><h3> When you are expecting a child, or if you already have young children, think about the following when choosing a potential guardian: <br/>  </h3><li> Parenting beliefs: Most parents are wise not to question the parenting style of others, but when choosing a guardian for your children, questions should be asked. For many parents, the habits and parenting style of a family member or close friend are already known. Given the need to ensure your children are raised as you would have done, a discussion about how your potential choice of guardian feels about your children and how they might parent them is important.</li><li> Capability: Is your choice of guardian capable?  While many people might appoint their own parents as guardians, age, activity level or even disability might suggest otherwise.  My parents actually asked me NOT to name them as guardians for this exact reason.  If you&rsquo;re thinking about your parents then ask them.</li><li> Your children: Do your children have a special relationship with a particular relative or friend?  A positive existing connection can help a parenting relationship if something happened to you.</li><li> Geography: If you have multiple candidates for guardian, does one reside where you might like your children to grow up?   Keep in mind, a move away from a home state or area could cause significant stress to a child who has already lost their parents. <br/>  </li><p> When you have candidates in mind to act as guardian for your children, your estate plan must be written to protect your choice. In New Jersey, courts give weight to guardians named by parents in their Will. Your estate plan should name a guardian in the event of your death or disablement. Property, insurance proceeds and other assets can be protected through a trust for use by your elected guardian&mdash;and provide an inheritance for your children when they are older.</p><p> <strong>  Making arrangements for your minor children if you are disabled or pass away protects them and gives you peace of mind.  </strong></p>",

    "content": "<h3> Our goals can cause collapse</h3><p> <br/> One major cause of my burnout as a young entrepreneur at the age of 27, was the fact that my goals were set unrealistically. I had set my goals high, aware that they had to make me stretch but unaware that we are all like elastic bands: if we stretch too far we eventually snap. I was a young real estate developer who appeared to have a death wish. Whenever a goal appeared to be within my reach, I would immediately revise my goal upward out of reach again, and always within an unrealistic time frame. The horrendous amount self-induced stress I created for myself took its toll on me mentally, spiritually, and physically. I learned the hard way, &ldquo;goals can be creative and destructive.&rdquo;</p><h3> Our limits are never discovered in our comfort zone</h3><p> <br/> The problem most of us face is that we never discover or limit or true potential, without pushing past it. At the age of 21, I left the commune I had been born into, with a goal of having a net worth of one million dollars by the age of 50. Without even looking for a job, I started my first business with the determination of a bulldog. I had decided, I would never work for anyone but myself. I believed I could do anything I set my mind to, if I wanted it badly enough. I wanted to be a financial success more than anything in the world. Within eighteen months of leaving the farm, I was married to the girl of my dreams and operating a successful business. We were in the midst of the 1981/82 recession. Here I was, just new in business, the country in a deep recession, and I decided to buy land to build a new home. Without a track record as a borrower, without experience as a businessman and without any collateral, I was deemed a bad risk because I &ldquo;lacked the resources.&rdquo;</p><h3> Our lack of resources may mean &ldquo;not now.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Every bank I visited turned me down. However, they all offered to finance me after I had proved myself in business and had acquired some assets that I could give them as collateral. When leaving their offices, I would say &ldquo;It sounds like you&rsquo;re prepared to loan me money when I can prove beyond all reasonable doubt that I have no need for it.&rdquo; Not finding the money was not going to stop me from building a house. I pushed ahead anyway and in sixty days, my wife and I moved into our new home without a mortgage. However, I did have some outstanding accounts with my sub-trades and suppliers. I had accomplished my goal but created a debt and the stress that went with it. Simply because I had to have what I wanted, and I had to have it now. I was not willing to wait!</p><h3> Goals require commitment with balance</h3><p> <br/> By the time I reached twenty-seven years of age, I had achieved a net worth of over one million dollars. I thought I was a success. Unfortunately, the only area of my life important to me at that time was the financial area. As I collapsed in burnout, my friends told me I was trying to do too much. The truth of the matter was, &ldquo;there were too much I wasn&rsquo;t doing.&rdquo; Goals in all areas of my life would have prevented the imbalance caused by unrealistic goals in one area.</p><h3> Goals need to challenge us without destroying us</h3><p> <br/> The key to preventing yourself from setting unrealistic goals is to maintain a balance between what is realistic and what presents us with an exciting challenge. The real reason for my unrealistic goal setting was the fact I was a perfectionist. I didn&rsquo;t just strive for excellence; I was striving for perfection. What is the difference? Fritz Ridenour says it best in his book The Traveler&rsquo;s Guide To Life At Warp Speed.</p><p> Perfectionism sets impossible goals. Excellence sets high standards within reach.</p><p> Perfectionism values &ldquo;what I do,&rdquo; excellence values &ldquo;who I am.&rdquo;</p><p> Perfectionism dwells on mistakes and excellence learns from them.</p><p> Perfectionism says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be number one,&rdquo; and excellence says &ldquo;I did my best and I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p><p> Unrealistic goals not only create undue stress but also make us feel discouraged by our failure to reach our goals, goals that were set too high in the first place. Failing to identify the resources, the time and the effort required to reach our goals will often result in us setting goals that are just simply unrealistic. In most cases those who raise the bar too high fall flat on their face. <strong>  A person without goals is like a ship without a rudder, but a person with unrealistic goals could be a person headed for trouble. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> If you have been engaging with  <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/author/ayeletb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  my thinking </a>  on building thriving 21st century organizations, you will know that this is the best time to be alive as we live in an open and connected world. If this is our first encounter, I look forward to connecting and learning from your thinking. That is what is so exciting about our century: our ability to find the right people at the right time to have  conversations and co-create. To truly understand the power of technology, you need to start with what you want to create in your organization and get the technology you need to make it happen.</p><p> If you look at the introduction of Enterprise 2.0 into many organizations and why they have not been an overwhelming success, you will understand that the keys to the Tesla were given to drivers who did not know how to get it on the highway. And if you have ever driven a Tesla, you know what a smooth ride it is and can be. <strong>  If we lead with technology, we will fail. If we see technology as a place to go, we will fail miserably. </strong></p><p> Too often, internal communication and IT were given responsibility for these platforms and they used 19th century thinking to implementing them. Too many internal communication functions still practice one-way communication and these platforms are about having conversations and co-creating. If you are simply using them for blogging (executive announcements and memorandums) and one-way communication, you are missing their true value. And that&rsquo;s what I have seen so many organizations doing over and over. An online community is not another place to go that you have to think about. If it is valuable you will tap into it as often as you need. Isn&rsquo;t that what we do with texting and Instant Messaging?</p><h3> Solving business problems with new ways of working</h3><p> <br/> After a year as an Innovator in Residence at Roche, I have many stories to share with you on how to build a 21st century organization. One of the first new way of working I introduced with Sheila Babnis, global head strategic innovation product development, was  <u>  working out loud </u> . The problem we were trying to solve is how do we drive innovative thinking and behaviors across the organization at all levels. And we figured out how to do it with technology and conversations. It takes a lot of courage to make this shift and once you do, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to go back.</p><h3> What is working out loud?</h3><p> <br/> If you have a small organization, working out loud can be very simple and easy although communication always seems complex. Working out loud is about sharing what you are working on in a way that brings other people to understand how they can also contribute. When you work out loud, you don&rsquo;t need endless one-way presentations. You put your work out in the world and find unexpected partners.</p><p> As Sheila shares: <br/> Working out loud is more than just sharing information. I see it as a key to building and strengthening relationships, helping to identify the right connections and having the right conversations that open the door to co-creation.</p><h3> Why work out loud?</h3><p> <br/> My answer to this is why have secrets if everyone is working for the same organization. Knowledge is definitely power and the more you share, the more powerful your organization can be. The key benefits include:</p><li> Less time in mind-numbing meetings</li><li> More access to information that leads to increased effectiveness because we are working in an open environment</li><li> Enables us to build trusted relationships and communities focused on a shared purpose <br/>  </li><h3> How to work out loud?</h3><p> <br/> Working Out Loud is about narrating your work in online communities, posting updates and information and questions for group discussion. It&rsquo;s about time-shifting conversations. It&rsquo;s about taking time to see what colleagues have posted and joining in those discussions.</p><p> According to Sheila and  <u>  John Stepper </u> , there are a few steps to get us going:</p><li> Create a dedicated space to share and have conversations with your colleagues, share a dedicated space where you post information and discuss topics that everyone can see and comment on.</li><li> Make it a habit: find what&rsquo;s valuable to you and if you can get the right people together you can have incredible ongoing conversations</li><li> Share: recognize that you are a source of abundant information and by sharing you enable colleagues to access information that can make them more effective in their jobs.</li><li> Tag your posts: tagging our posts in your collaboration space allows anyone to search for the information as they need it, or even choose to receive the information by requesting notifications on certain tags, topics, or by thought leaders and blog posters.</li><li> Encourage others to join you: as others join you in working out loud the exchange of conversation moves from building trust to ultimately building and strengthening relationships. With that trust, you are making connections to help solve problems at accelerated speeds! <br/>  </li><h3> What&rsquo;s the impact?</h3><p> <br/> The 21st century leader knows that work is about collaboration and co-creation. Working out loud ensures knowledge being shared vertically rather and horizontally increases the speed and adoption. Sharing information helps many more people in their thinking and helps them build new connections that are important to their work.</p><p> For Sheila, a few behavior changes were essential: The first was to stop attending so many meetings; and let others own the meetings and the personal relationships in some cases.It is tough to do when you are a connector. Ultimately SheiIa found that Working Out Loud enabled her to connect on a larger scale and with many new people who she could ask for help in solving problems, gathering information and more.</p><p> The impact was that Sheila balanced her time better. She has fewer meetings. Her team has cut time spent in meetings by almost 50 per cent. They work online and make decisions whenever they can. The method has accelerated the time to complete key deliverable and make important decisions. Sheila says she has more time to think.</p><p> There was also a significant mindset shift to this is about relationships to do things rather than networks to have. Relationships enables listening and hearing; relationships lead to conversations online and the ability to solve problems in new ways. WOL makes it faster and easier ask for help and make more things possible and things happen faster. Getting perspective from outside helped shape Sheila&rsquo;s thinking and what Roche can do in the innovation space.</p><p> The bottom line is that Sheila is a 21st century leader and this is only one of many stories of how she adopted new ways of working. And there is no turning back. She&rsquo;s happy to let go of her old way of working.  She finds WOL so much better.  As Sheila says, its great to have the community/network helping you get the job done every day.</p><p> So when will you start? What do you need help with to fundamentally shift your mindset and behaviors?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://alexpirouz.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Alex Pirouz  </u> </a>  </p><p> Each company is defined by it. Not many know it by name and many don&rsquo;t even know it exists! It&rsquo;s your company culture, your DNA, if you will, of your organization!</p><p> Your culture defines the way in which your organization interacts with one another and how the team interacts with the outside world, specifically your partners, suppliers and customers. People will want to do business with you because of what you believe in and stand for, rather than solely on your products alone.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the formula that guides the team, as well as inspires and motivates employees. It is also responsible for attracting and attaining great talent, as well as creating a fun, happy, healthy and exciting work environment.</p><p> Understanding this principal will quickly allow you to see the importance of your company culture and the role it plays in the success of your business. Over the past 6 years I&rsquo;ve started multiple businesses, some were complete failures and a few we managed to successfully exit.</p><p> When I look back at the key factors that made the difference between the businesses that failed compared to those that succeeded, I would definitely have to say that staff culture was one of the main factors in the equation.</p><p> A lot of the times we were entering an already saturated market place with pre-existing competitors who offered a similar product or service to us. But what made us stand out were our company culture and the way we as a team interacted with client&rsquo;s day in day out. </p><p> With the rare exception, things like your products, strategies and even your techniques can be duplicated. The only truly unique identifiers are the values and norms of your organization. <br/> <br/> To gain a deeper insight into the mechanics of what it takes to build a great company culture on my recent trip to San Francisco I decided to visit some of the biggest companies in the world such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and a few others.</p><p> Whilst I learnt heck of a lot from each company and the way they had built their culture, the place I was most impressed by was LinkedIn and here&rsquo;s 3 reasons why:</p><h3> 1) Common Goal</h3><p> <br/> Everybody I spoke with was excited to be at work, you could see it in their eyes, feel it in the way they spoke and most importantly how they made me feel whilst in their presence.</p><p> Employee&rsquo;s today are looking for a purpose to their work that is easily stated, outwardly directed, and makes a real difference. Getting to us, therefore, begins with knowing your why.</p><p> For exceptional organizations, profit is not confused with purpose. Why is an unambiguous statement of higher calling that transcends the profit motive? Profit becomes a by-product of purpose.</p><p> It became very clear to me that everyone not only believes in the company, but can directly see how their role is an important element to achieving the overall mission of LinkedIn</p><p> &ldquo;A company&rsquo;s culture can be one of its greatest assets &ndash; particularly when it comes to attracting the best and brightest talent.  When your employees are inspired and collectively focused on a common goal, great things can happen.&rdquo;  &ndash;  <u>  Crystal Braswell </u> , LinkedIn Corporate Communications Manager</p><h3> 2) Personal Growth</h3><p> <br/> The second thing that stood out for me was LinkedIn&rsquo;s interest in the personal growth of their employees outside of their profession and role.  Ever since I started my first company, I made a commitment that regardless of what business I start I would always have two things in mind in pursuit of business success:</p><p> a) To make a positive change to the lives of customers who use our service/product</p><p> b) Inspire every staff member to think bigger and live a more fulfilled life both personally and professionally</p><p> This philosophy was quite evident in LinkedIn&rsquo;s approach to staff development and ongoing growth. Every month LinkedIn give their employees a day off to work on projects they are personally passionate about.</p><p> The staffs are free to support any project or charity and can work solo or in a team. They call this: &ldquo;In Day&rdquo;. They also have bi-annual &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://linkedinforgood.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   Nonprofit Innovation Grants  </a> </u> &rdquo; where they support social causes their staff are passionate about.</p><p> &ldquo;InDays are one of my favorite perks of working at LinkedIn. It&rsquo;s a unique opportunity that happens twelve times a year, and gives every employee at LinkedIn a chance to take a break from their usual work responsibilities and focus on ideas, projects, or causes that inspire us.&rdquo;  &ndash;  <u>  Doug Madey </u> , LinkedIn Corporate Communications Manager</p><h3> 3) Inter-connected</h3><p> <br/> And finally the thing I loved most about LinkedIn&rsquo;s culture was their level of inter-connectedness. For a company as big as LinkedIn (now close to 6,000 employees), it sure felt like a start-up. <br/> Walking around the premises it felt like everyone knew each other on a personal level. Something like this doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight; building great culture takes time and requires innovative thinking.</p><p> When you first start working at LinkedIn one of the main goals they set within your first 3 months of employment is to speak with and get to know as many staff members as possible.</p><p> If a company of this size can do this, there are no excuses. Make it a priority to get to know each and every one of your co-workers; the results will speak for themselves.</p><p> Now of course, understanding what needs to be done to create a positive corporate culture is much easier than actually implementing the changes.</p><p> Depending upon your current culture, it may take a massive amount of effort on the part of several areas of management and departments, and perhaps even severe organizational changes, in order to create the culture you desire.</p><p> But once the cycle does begin, the positive results can be tremendous, and a well-maintained corporate culture will soon move forward of its own volition of company pride and employee happiness increases.</p>",

    "title": "10 FBI Tips On How To Spot A Liar",
    "link": "10-fbi-tips-on-how-to-spot-a-liar",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  FBI agents are trained to read other people and uncover what is hidden so they can get to the truth of a situation. Their job is to recognize language inconsistencies and other verbal cues to spot liars and deceptive behavior. </strong></p><p> It would be nice if every job candidate, negotiating partner, and supplier told the truth&mdash;but they do not. In addition, many business owners and entrepreneurs get embezzled by the employees they trust.</p><p> In the world of business, being successful often means being able to spot liars and people who are deceptive. How do you know when someone is telling you the truth? And if you do believe something you are told, how can you be sure it&rsquo;s not because you want it to be true?</p><p> Here are 10 FBI tips on how to spot the liar:</p><h3> 1. Build Rapport</h3><p> <br/> Coming across as empathetic in a conversation gets the person to open up more than when the interviewer is cold and accusatory. Developing rapport is the place to start.</p><h3> 2. Fill In The Blanks</h3><p> <br/> Instead of asking direct questions, tell the person the story as if you already know all the facts. Make it a statement&mdash;the guilty party will supply details and make corrections.</p><h3> 3. Surprise Them</h3><p> <br/> The person knows they are guilty and will be prepared for your questions. If you ask them something they do not expect, they will usually stumble when put on the spot.</p><h3> 4. Ask For The Story Backward</h3><p> <br/> Truthful people tend to add details and remember facts the more they repeat their story. Liars, on the other hand, memorize their stories and keep them the same. Ask the person to recall events backward rather than forward in time. </p><p> For example, start at the end and then ask them to explain what happened right before that point. And so on&hellip;</p><p> For truthful people, this makes recall easier. For liars, they tend to simplify the story so they don&rsquo;t contradict themselves.</p><h3> 5. Withhold Evidence</h3><p> <br/> If confronted with evidence of guilt too early, the person will either clam up or become hostile. Instead, give them the opportunity to make a confession. If they don&rsquo;t, allude to evidence in such a way that they realize you know the facts.</p><h3> 6. Listen More Than You Talk</h3><p> <br/> Liars tend to talk more than truthful people in an attempt to sound legitimate and win over their audience. Liars also tend to use more complex sentences to hide the truth. Here are some other things to look for:</p><li> Stress usually increases the speed of speech.</li><li> A stressed person may also talk louder.</li><li> Cracking in the natural tone of the voice often occurs at the point of deception.</li><li> Coughing and clearing the throat are good signs of tension at the point when they occur. <br/>  </li><h3> 7. NO Is A Key Word</h3><p> <br/> A person is most likely showing deceptive behavior when they:</p><li> Say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and look in a different direction (upward, downward, etc)</li><li> Say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and close their eyes</li><li> Say &ldquo;no&rdquo; after a hesitation</li><li> Say &ldquo;noooooooo&rdquo; stretched over a long period of time</li><li> Say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in a singsong manner <br/>  </li><h3> 8. Be Wary Of Compliments</h3><p> <br/> Watch out for someone who is trying too hard to make a good impression:</p><li> Emphasizing respect for your qualities and talents</li><li> Forming a mutual bond by reminding you of common friends and activities you share</li><li> Offering lots of praise and pleasantries</li><li> Laughing at all your jokes (a sure give-away) <br/>  </li><h3> 9. Watch for Changes in Behavior</h3><p> <br/> Take the time to notice subtle changes in behavior when you are interviewing them:</p><li> Exhibiting lapses in memory at critical times even though they&rsquo;ve been alert in earlier conversation</li><li> Providing small crumbs of information to questions asked</li><li> Moving into a more formal way of speaking indicates that the conversation is hitting a point of stress</li><li> Using extreme superlatives or exaggerated responses, such as saying awesome instead of good <br/>  </li><h3> 10. Ask follow-up questions</h3><p> <br/> If the person exhibits uneasiness with a specific question, take the time to explore further. For example, &ldquo;Explain this gap in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;&rdquo; may lead to an answer such as, &ldquo;I was recuperating from hip surgery.&rdquo; Often, the deception that you&rsquo;ve uncovered may be related to a personal embarrassment or a desire to be &ldquo;the perfect candidate.&rdquo;</p><p> What ways have you found to spot liars?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I still remember the best (unsolicited) testimonial I ever got.</h3><p> <br/> The CEO was positively giddy with relief after my team and I had pulled her out of a bet-the-business problem that had consumed us all for months. She turned to me and said &ldquo;If I ever go into battle again, I want you right next to me.&rdquo;</p><p> I wrote that down and carried it around with me for years, pulling it out whenever my confidence needed a little bolstering.</p><p> See, here&rsquo;s the thing: testimonials aren&rsquo;t just a come-hither promise to hawk your services.</p><p> They&rsquo;re also a reminder of the challenging, sometimes gut-wrenching work you do with your clients. And that ultimate shared high&mdash;the we-made-it-to-the-top-of-the-mountain feeling when you reach your ultimate goal. Together.</p><h3> So don&rsquo;t kid yourself&mdash;great testimonials  matter .</h3><p> <br/> They help you put the cherry on top of a successful project&mdash;and figure out how to do it even better next time.</p><p> And when they&rsquo;re well shared, they give your future clients an authentic, visceral &ldquo;this is what I can deliver for you&rdquo; glimpse into your work.</p><p> They&rsquo;ll be the opposite of boring.</p><p> To ask for&mdash;and rock&mdash;your client testimonials, start by making a habit of naturally ending your projects with a feedback loop (If you&rsquo;re more product-oriented, bake it into the sales process).</p><p> When your work is done&mdash;or at the right pause point if it&rsquo;s ongoing&mdash;send your client an email explaining that you&rsquo;d like his feedback (email gives him the opportunity to think about it a bit&mdash;you can always call him up later to discuss his comments). Include these five questions:</p><li> <strong>  What was your biggest fear/worry/concern before you hired me/bought my product? </strong>  Tip: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make it highly specific: &ldquo;What was your biggest concern when you hired me to evaluate your marketing strategy?&rdquo; This allows you to get inside the head of your client as she makes the pivotal decision to hire you. It gives you a window into her emotional state&mdash;get enough of these and you&rsquo;ll know EXACTLY how to speak to your sweet-spot clients and buyers.</li><li> <strong>  What did you value most about our work together? </strong>  This gives you clarity about the value you bring to your engagements and your products. Think of it as a way to understand that &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; that only you bring to the table.</li><li> <strong>  What if anything surprised you? </strong>  This gets you under the hood of client expectations. Knowing what surprised him allows you to do it more consistently (or nip it in the bud).</li><li> <strong>  What would you have liked to be different? </strong>  (Note: this is an important part of the feedback loop so you can keep getting better.) Put any lingering client/buyer concerns out in the open to be addressed. Being vulnerable enough to ask and listen closely without being defensive will cement her bond with you. It&rsquo;s called building trust.</li><li> <strong>  Would you recommend me&mdash;and why? </strong>  This either gives you valuable new information or&mdash;more likely&mdash;allows you to add a happy client to your webpage who is predisposed to recommend you to his peers. <br/>  </li><p> Once you have dealt with any open issues, you&rsquo;ll know for certain if you have the elements of a public testimonial: Is this the client you want crowing to the rooftops about you?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say the answer is yes. It&rsquo;s time to whip his words into a form you can use on your website or promotional materials.</p><p> Start by editing her feedback down to a meaningful SHORT piece that fits with the space you have allotted but is still in her voice (not yours). You&rsquo;re not writing, you&rsquo;re EDITING. Big difference.</p><p> Send him your proposed testimonial, explaining how you&rsquo;d like to use it. Don&rsquo;t worry, most will appreciate that you&rsquo;ve encapsulated their verbiage and precious few start wordsmithing.</p><p> And ask for her photo&mdash;testimonials carry more weight when attached to a full (real) name and image. So if your profession and your clients permit, go with photos. There&rsquo;s nothing like seeing a page with your best clients smiling back at you.</p><p> Finally, after all this you have your gold: a set of heartfelt testaments to your unique talents, passions, results and personality. Emotionally resonant tributes from the clients you&rsquo;d happily clone if only you could.</p><p> Catnip to your perfect future clients and buyers&hellip;</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Between the years of 1946 and 1964, it is estimated that 76 million babies were born in America. Known as the baby boomers, many are reaching their retirement years in a drastically changing economy.  </p><h3> One size does not fit all for Financial Advisors.  </h3><p> <br/> Attitudes, values and perceptions are shaped by headlines of the times, politics, economics, people, places, conditions and events. Both Baby Boomers and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/advisors-millennial-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Millennials  </a> </u>  require knowledgeable Advisors who understand their own unique issues and can help guide them.  For a look at the Financial Tech Habits of Baby Boomers, check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/advisors-financial-tech-habits-of-baby-boomers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Part 1  </a> </u>  of this series before moving on.</p><p> A common misconception is that baby boomers are not on social media. However, boomers are actually among the fastest growing groups on social media &ndash; particularly Facebook, which they consider less impersonal than Twitter. Social Network use among Internet users 50 years and older has nearly doubled over the past year. Social media use is just as strong for those in the 50-64-age bracket with boomers increasing their presence on Facebook alone by 80% between 2011 and 2014. And lastly, the fastest growing demographic on twitter is the 55-64 year age bracket, which has grown 79% since 2012  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3021749/work-smart/10-surprising-social-media-statistics-that-will-make-you-rethink-your-social-stra\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   (FastCompany, 2013)  </u>  . </a></p><h3> This certainly points to the importance of having a social media strategy.</h3><p> <br/> Throwing more advertisements at baby boomers is an unlikely way to gain clients. Advisors need to stay consistently relevant, visible and valuable where Baby Boomers are spending their time online.  Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the most popular websites where baby boomers are hanging out these days:</p><li> <u>  Huffington Post 50 </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/retirement/\" target=\"_blank\">   CNN Money &amp; Retirement  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   NY Times: New Old Age Blog  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  The Retirement Pros </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MarketWatch  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yahoo! Finance  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seniornet.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SeniorNet  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.babyboomerstraveling.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Baby Boomers Travelling  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/personal-finance-for-seniors-for-dummies-cheat-she.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Personal Finance for Seniors  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AARP  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.everythingzoomer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Everything Zoomer  </a> </u> <br/>  </li><p> Advisors should focus on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   quality content  </a> </u>  and creating an online social campaign that will capture the interest of the baby boomer demographic. One way for Advisors to do this on Social Media is to join communities, and follow and engage with the blogs, websites, and organizations, listed above, that baby boomers consider to be respectable, knowledgeable and credible sources. On their social media profiles, Advisors can amalgamate and share articles from these trusted sources to become a go-to online source for clients and prospects looking for useful information, advice, insights and resources. This will help Advisors to display their grasp of helpful thought leadership, to their clients, through surfacing the best content that baby boomers are looking for.</p><p> In a digital world of nearly infinite content, an Advisor&rsquo;s social media presence can become a baby boomer&rsquo;s one-stop shop for great articles, advice and insights into the Financial Industry.  This will help Advisors to build trust with their followers, and build relationships with others in the industry through sharing their content. Creating and sharing consistent valuable content on Social Media will help Advisors to gain credibility and authority in their industry or niche, which is important for online growth and visibility.</p><p> <strong>  Is your business marketing to baby boomers online? What strategies have been the most successful for you in reaching this demographic? </strong></p>",

Unless you have a CEO or CFO for who appreciates the value of HR&rsquo;s consultation;</p><h3> HR is fighting a war with no armaments.</h3><p> <br/> If you canvas the open job vacancies online long enough, you will find a strong presence of job descriptions that appear to include responsibilities and duties enough to for 2 FTE&rsquo;s ; but it is being marketed for one person. In addition, if you go a step further and apply to a few of these jobs and are lucky to have a conversation with some of these companies; you will also find that the pay isn&rsquo;t nearly as competitive or fair as you would expect given the employer&rsquo;s expectations. It&rsquo;s easy to ask HR why wages are down or stagnant, but perhaps we should be asking the CEO&rsquo;s why they choose to stagnate wage increases when it is clear that they want more from their workforce. What is further interesting is: a 2014 report from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Economic Policy Institute  </a> </u>  reports that CEO wages at the largest corporations have increased 937% since 1978 (when adjusted for inflation). According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/12/ceo-pay-report_n_5484622.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rebecca Hiscott  </a> </u>  of the Huffington Post, the average worker&rsquo;s compensation grew 10.2% of that same time period.</p><p> <strong>  Less income has caused lower assets, decreased net worth, increased debt and liabilities. </strong> Throw in familial obligations and other personal concerns coupled with work pressures and it may not be hard to understand how we still have around 70% of the workforce being disengaged.  I believe the tone gets set at the top. Toxic leadership often leads to  <u>  <a href=\"http://thearistocracyofhr.com/the-secret-life-of-hr-all-about-the-resources-not-the-human/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   toxic HR  </a> </u> , particularly when we don&rsquo;t have the balls to speak up or leave. HR can only be effective in addressing workforce issues if and only if the CEO values the people. They don&rsquo;t have to necessarily love and buy into what we do in HR. If they have a <u>   talent first </u>  mentality, they will urge HR to do whatever is necessary to attract and retain talent. Under these circumstances, HR has advocacy at the top as well as the license to create programs and initiatives that favor both the business and employees .</p><p> As an HR practitioner, I have had the experience of working  in many different environments. Despite our best efforts to make a change or address a concern in our organizations, there were many instances where no changes were made (or the changes were completely different from our initial recommendation). This happens because; ultimately we are not the final authority. A lot of what we do is in consultation to our internal partners. We can argue that the quality and substance of our consultation are the contributing factors to the success of any workforce change or initiative. Still. owners, founders and figureheads need to shoulder some of the responsibility for workforce related issues. I&rsquo;m not blind or ignorant to the unnecessary complexity and toxicity HR is capable of creating in an organization separate and apart from the CEO&rsquo;s vision; but it doesn&rsquo;t come from nowhere.</p><p> <strong>  There was a time that CEO&rsquo;s could say they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;they weren&rsquo;t aware&rdquo; of the systemic issues in their companies. </strong> With social media being the go-to platform to expose companies for everything from fraudulent practices to unfair and discriminatory workplace conditions, you better know what&rsquo;s going on in your company and be vigilant about addressing any issues. HR can do a lot, but we can only do as much as executive leadership will allow. If the organization is driven by greed and lining the pockets of board members and leadership, HR will be directed to aid and abet that approach.</p><h3> The question then becomes an ethical and moral one for HR.</h3><p> <br/> If you are working in a company that is not doing right by the employees (including HR), do you continue to fight beyond your obvious lack of power settling for marginal wins or do you keep your head down and do as you are told?</p>",

    "title": "The Psychology of Investing: What's Your Investor Personality?",
    "link": "the-psychology-of-investing-whats-your-investor-personality",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When it comes to money and investing, there are many factors that contribute to the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; of important decisions. According to many Behavioral Finance studies, our different personalities traits &amp; preferences, along with a range of emotional and mental behavioral biases, have a strong impact on the way we invest.</p><h3> Investor Personality Types</h3><p> <br/> There are 4 different types of investors, according to the CFA Institute,* each with their own distinct behavioral biases. Understanding your own investor personality type can go a long way toward helping you determine and meet your long term investment goals, as well as producing better returns.</p><p> Which of these profiles best describes you?</p><p> <strong>  Preservers </strong>  are investors who place a great deal of emphasis on financial security and on preserving wealth rather than taking risks to grow wealth. Preservers watch closely over their assets and are anxious about losses and short-term performance. They may also have trouble taking action for fear of making the wrong investments decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Accumulators </strong>  are investors who are interested in accumulating wealth and are confident they can do so. Accumulators tend to want to steer the ship when it comes to making investment decisions. They are risk takers and typically believe that whatever path they choose is the correct one. Accumulators have frequently been successful in prior business endeavors and are confident that they will make successful investors as well.</p><p> <strong>  Followers </strong>  are investors who tend to follow the lead of their friends and colleagues, a general investing fad, or the status quo, rather than having their own ideas or making their own decisions about investing.  Followers may lack interest and/or knowledge of the financial markets and their decision-making process may lack a long-term plan.</p><p> <strong>  Independents </strong>  are investors who have original ideas about investing and like to be involved in the investment process. Unlike Followers, they are very interested in the process of investing, and are engaged in the financial markets. Many Independents are analytical and critical thinkers and trust themselves to make confident and informed decisions, but risk the pitfalls of only following their own research.</p><h3> The Psychology Of Investing Biases</h3><p> <br/> Behavioral biases affect us all as investors and can vary depending upon our investor personality type. These biases can be cognitive: a tendency to think and act in a certain way or follow a &ldquo;rule of thumb.&rdquo; Biases can also be emotional: a tendency to take action based on feeling rather than fact.</p><p> According to a study done by H. Kent Baker and Victor Ricciardi on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=512\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How Biases Affect Investor Behavior  </a> </u> , here are 8 biases that can affect investment decisions:</p><p> <strong>  Anchoring or Confirmation Bias: </strong>  First impressions can be hard to shake because we tend to selectively filter, paying more attention to information that supports our opinions, while ignoring the rest. Likewise, we often resort to preconceived opinions when encountering something, or someone, new. An investor whose thinking is subject to confirmation bias would be more likely to look for information that supports his or her original idea about an investment rather than seek out information that contradicts it.</p><p> <strong>  Regret Aversion Bias: </strong>  Also known as loss aversion, regret aversion describes wanting to avoid the feeling of regret experienced after making a choice with a negative outcome. Investors who are influenced by anticipated regret take less risk because it lessens the potential for poor outcomes. Regret aversion can explain an investor &lsquo;s reluctance to sell &ldquo;losing&rdquo; investments to avoid confronting the fact that they have made poor decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Disposition Effect Bias: </strong> This refers to a tendency to label investments as &lsquo;winners&rsquo; or &lsquo;losers.&rsquo; Disposition effect bias can lead an investor to hang on to an investment that no longer has any upside or sell a winning investment too early to make up for previous losses. This is harmful because it can increase capital gains taxes and can reduce returns even before taxes.</p><p> <strong>  Hindsight Bias: </strong>  Another common perception bias is hindsight bias, which leads an investor to believe &ndash; after the fact &ndash; that the onset of a past event was predictable and completely obvious whereas, in fact, the event could not have been reasonably predicted.</p><p> <strong>  Familiarity Bias: </strong>   This occurs when investors have a preference for familiar or well known investments despite the seemingly obvious gains from diversification. The investor may feel anxiety when diversifying investments between well known domestic securities and lesser known international securities, as well as between both familiar and unfamiliar stocks and bonds that are outside of a &ldquo;comfort zone.&rdquo; This can lead to suboptimal portfolios with a greater a risk of losses.</p><p> <strong>  Self-Attribution Bias: </strong> Investors who suffer from self-attribution bias tend to attribute successful outcomes to their own actions and bad outcomes to external factors. They often exhibit this bias as a means of self-protection or self-enhancement. Investors affected by self-attribution bias may become overconfident.</p><p> <strong>  Trend-chasing Bias: </strong> Investors often chase past performance in the mistaken belief that historical returns predict future investment performance. This tendency is complicated by the fact that some product issuers may increase advertising when past performance is high, in order to attract new investors. Research demonstrates, however, that investors do not benefit because performance as frequently as not fails to persist in the future.</p><p> <strong>  Worry: </strong> The act of worrying is a natural, and common, human emotion. Worry evokes memories and creates visions of possible future scenarios that alter an investor&rsquo;s judgment about personal finances. Anxiety about an investment increases its perceived risk and lowers the level of risk tolerance.  To avoid this bias, investors should match their level of risk tolerance with an appropriate asset allocation strategy.</p><p> <strong>  Which investor personality best describes you and which biases are you predisposed to? </strong></p>",

    "title": "Failing Sales People & Fear - How to Overcome",
    "link": "failing-sales-people-fear-how-to-overcome",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In the first chapter of this topic I was talking about the reasons why some sales people fail. Very often it is fear.</p><p> The only way to overcome that is to identify when we are afraid and then to work toward a solution.</p><h3> You cannot change what you don't acknowledge</h3><p> <br/> Very often I observe that women have a much easier way of understanding their strengths and (what we call) opportunities for growth. I am not a psychologist or an expert on gender studies, but I believe that it has to have something to do with the way we were socialized. However, during all my years of coaching I have seen as many guys struggling with fear as I have with women, just that it took longer for men to admit that the root cause of some of their sales traits was driven by the fear of failure. Sales is very personal, we need to understand that. We are only as good as our numbers and rejection can feel very personal.</p><h3> Repetition is Learning</h3><p> <br/> I always compare, being comfortable and successful in a consultative sales environment to driving stick shift. As long as you are focusing on shifting gears, you will not be in command of your vehicle and you won't be able to focus on traffic the way you should. You need to get to a point where shifting becomes second nature. The same holds true when prospecting, for example. You need to be comfortable when picking up the phone, easing into conversations, being prepared to ask the right questions when the opportunity arises, or ending the conversation should you feel the vibe that it's not a good time. But feeling the vibe is only possible when you are content, not focusing on what to say or being frightened.</p><h3> Practice makes perfect</h3><p> <br/> It really does, in every area of our life. I, for example have no fear of cold calling whatsoever. Not sure why, but I almost get an adrenalin high when chasing C-Level prospects and breaking through to them. For some reason the universe has given me that unique gift and I embrace it and tapped into it to start a business.</p><p> Flying on the other hand was something that caused me sleepless nights, shaking, sweats and all the other unpleasant things that happen when you are afraid of something. Air travel, in spite of all the accidents, terrorist attacks, etc. is still safer than getting into a car, but I certainly don't tremble when driving north on I-95, although I should looking at the statistics.</p><p> Once I recognized this fear as being a constant companion, I started to choose air travel over ground travel every single time I had a choice, just to make it more routine. Unless there is a deeper psychological issue simmering, the more often you do something, the easier it will be.</p><p> Still to this day I don't like turbulences (neither do I like potholes on the highway), but these days I board an airplane with the same ease as getting into my car.</p><h3> Research, Prepare, Do, Repeat</h3><p> <br/> The better prepared you are and the more you prepare, the more comfortable you will be in any sales situation, it puts you in the driver's seat. Write out the questions you want to ask and make sure you start with a Why, What, When or How so the answers will not be a simple yes or no.  Pick up the phone, when you are afraid of cold calling, there is nothing like jumping into the pool and swimming. Take a deep breath after every prospect/client interaction, reflect and then do it again! That's a big step in overcoming  your fears.</p><h3> Test your Sales IQ</h3><p> <br/> There are many great tools out there to test your sales acumen. My company, the Consultative Sales Academy offers a Sales IQ. It is not a psychometric exam or aptitude test, but rather a quick and thorough method to measure your sales skills and knowledge. Once you know what your strengths are and where you need work, you can focus on those areas. In our case, we have corresponding learning modules that help you become stronger in the areas that need improvement. We encourage our participants to learn and apply. The only way to improve is to focus on one learning competency at a time and to repeat as often as possible, until it becomes routine. Feel free to check out our SalesIQ at <u>  www.getyoursalesiq.com </u></p><h3> Celebrate your success and reward yourself for ever No</h3><p> <br/> Entrepreneurs and sales people don't celebrate their successes enough. We are easy to point out bad experiences, but hardly every take the time to acknowledge what we have accomplished. It's important. Take the time to reflect and celebrate AND also reward yourself for every No that you get. Whether your prospect will agree to a conversation or not, you have worked hard to get somebody on the phone and whether they are interested or not is not always something you can control. It's common in sales to get rejected  and the more often you experience it, the easier it will become. If you like chocolate, put Hershey kisses on your desk and grab one every single time your prospect says no thanks.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jorgensundberg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jorgen Sundberg  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://socialmedialondon.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Media London  </a> </u>  </p><p> How do get started with social selling? I recently had a chat with (Advisorpedia Contributor)  <u>  <a href=\"/contributors/timothy-hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tim Hughes  </a> </u> , Director at Oracle UK as well as a social selling evangelist, avid tweeter and blogger. A longer version of this interview is available at  <u>  <a href=\"http://linkhumans.com/blog/social-selling-tim-hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Link Humans  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Why is social selling important?</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve seen a big change, not necessarily so much within the selling process, but within the buying process. Most people now, whenever you want to buy something, you go to Google and you do a search. Quite often, people actually are actually making decisions and purchasing online and are going ahead and doing that based on from that search. And they&rsquo;re not actually involving a salesperson.</p><p> Some of the research says that something like 72% of buyers are going through a process, and when they get to something like 50%, 60%, 70% &ndash; I&rsquo;ve even got figures that show 80% of the way through the buying cycle &ndash; it&rsquo;s only then that they actually engage with the salesperson. Going back 20 years ago, it would have been a 20% of the way through the buying cycle. Some research indicates that 25% of B2B salespeople jobs won&rsquo;t exist in 2020. And what will you be replaced by? You&rsquo;ll be replaced with a search engine.</p><img alt=\"Source\" src=\"http://linkhumans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/social-sales-model.png\"/><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/11/05/the-rise-of-social-salespeople/\" target=\"_blank\">   Source  </a> </u></p><p> The 5 pillars of social selling success are:</p><h3> 1. LinkedIn</h3><p> <br/> First and foremost I recommend that you get in on LinkedIn. While you can use the free version, I do recommend you get the professional addition because you get access to the Sales Navigator. If you&rsquo;re looking to get hold of the people and looking and searching for people, then the Sales Navigator will help you. You&rsquo;ve got to move away from the traditional, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve set up my LinkedIn profile as a way of attracting recruiters for my next job&rdquo; and actually create what I would call a bio-centric profile.</p><p> So you need to think about your product and service and outputs, what is it that it actually does? Does it increase revenue? Does it improve profit? Does it enable you to reduce stock? What is that end point you&rsquo;re going to do? And that is what you need to be looking at, building your LinkedIn profile around.</p><p> <img alt=\"tim hughes linkedin\" src=\"http://linkhumans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tim-hughes-linkedin.png\"/> <br/> And if anyone goes to my LinkedIn profile, what you&rsquo;ll see is that I don&rsquo;t have a job title like Master Principal Consultant. The job title is what I do, and it&rsquo;s what I do in my online world. I have a picture because if you don&rsquo;t have a picture, you&rsquo;re like a spammer. And you have a description of what you do. And again, this is about an output, and this is not about that you make a hundred calls a day. It&rsquo;s about what the output is and this fact that you&rsquo;re creating leads or appointments for people. So it&rsquo;s a way of moving the LinkedIn profile on, and it&rsquo;s a way of getting to position. And if somebody is in a position that they&rsquo;re looking to buy something, you should be, and your LinkedIn profile should, in effect, be coming up on the searches that they&rsquo;re doing.</p><p> If you went to that media, video, Powerpoints, you&rsquo;re posting on that daily in terms of interesting articles, people are going to go, &ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s an interesting person. I need to talk to them.&rdquo; And I also talk to people about&hellip; Even if you&rsquo;re not using it for demand generation and you&rsquo;re going to meetings, most people now, when you were interested in me, the first thing that you would have done was go into my LinkedIn profile. And you would have made a decision about whether Tim was interesting and whether Tim was interesting to have a webcast with purely from my shop window, which is at LinkedIn profile.</p><p> So my LinkedIn profile obviously worked in that particular case. It is your shop window to the world. And how you create and what you put on there, I don&rsquo;t want to labour the point about it, but don&rsquo;t come across as too much as a corporate suit. Also, think about what it is that you want other people to think about you. So you&rsquo;re loyal. You&rsquo;re trustworthy. You are a family man. You&rsquo;ve got old cars. You&rsquo;re into crochet or whatever it is. So make sure that the LinkedIn profile is about you as a whole and about you as a total person, not that you work for a particular corporation or a particular company. It&rsquo;s got to be everything about you. So that&rsquo;s the first step or pillar that I recommend that people look up.</p><h3> 2. Listening</h3><p> <br/> So it&rsquo;s listening out on social media, whether that&rsquo;s with listening on hashtags, listening about your brand, listening about people coming on saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about&hellip;&rdquo;. For example, I&rsquo;ve been interested in doing demand generation about video. And I&rsquo;ve been on to Twitter a couple of times and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in doing some demand gen. Are there any video companies that want to come and contact me?&rdquo; There are people that are doing that. And as a B2B organisation, we use a tool to listen to certain things that are going on and the footprints that people are leaving out there in social media.</p><h3> 3. Marketing automation</h3><p> <br/> The third element that I recommend is that you start looking at some form of marketing automation. Now, marketing automation is a big step. It&rsquo;s usually a big implementation. But the gains that you&rsquo;ll get from that are usually pretty good. In terms of our return on investment, when we were doing&hellip; If I can admit that we actually have people that cold-call, if you actually are cold-calling people, usually we would get a response of about 5 in 100. Of those 100, another 25 would say, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m kind of interested, but it&rsquo;ll be another three or six months.&rdquo;</p><p> What we do is that we put those 25 into a nurture program using our Eloqua product. And we nurture those now over a three- to six-month period. So generally what happens is that, while in the past, we had a 5-out-of-100 response, we now get a 30-out-of-100 response. So that&rsquo;s a pretty good ROI, and that&rsquo;s certainly something that you build up over time. But again, it&rsquo;s not necessarily for the fainthearted.</p><h3> 4. Influencers</h3><p> <br/> The fourth pillar that I&rsquo;ve looked up really is about influencers. So what is an influencer, and why would I care? In the past, generally, people would go out to third party organisations, probably Gartner, Forrester, IDC, and sought their opinion about whatever they were particularly looking at. And those organisations are still important. But there are people out there, bloggers like myself who have an influence. People like Ted Rubin, Brian Solis, Bryan Kramer, people like that who have an opinion and are also driving the debate forward in terms of social, social enterprise, the sharing economy etc.</p><p> So one of the things that you might want to do is actually contact those people. And why would you want to do that? When a buyer goes through the buying process, generally, they&rsquo;ll go on and look at Google. They&rsquo;ll make a decision, and then they will start talking to influencers, that maybe that they&rsquo;ll turn to somebody in the office and say, &ldquo;You bought an HCM system when you worked at AstraZeneca. What did you buy? Was it any good?&rdquo; And I did that when I bought my car. I turned to people that had the make of car as me. But also, there&rsquo;s people that they could be contacting that have an influence. So I actually get people that come to me directly and say, &ldquo;What CRM system should I buy?&rdquo;.</p><p> And from a sales perspective, you can move yourself where you can present not only your shop window in terms of LinkedIn, but you can start hacking the sales process that you&rsquo;re starting to pick up people that are looking for your products and service as they move down up towards that 60%. So before they&rsquo;ve actually rung you up, you&rsquo;re picking those up. Not only will you be getting more pipeline, but you should be winning more because you were able to close those down ahead of the competition.</p><h3> 5. Enterprise social network</h3><p> <br/> The final one is something that we&rsquo;ve actually implemented internally, which is an enterprise social network. And it happens to be our own because we&rsquo;re Oracle and we have one. But what we do with the enterprise social network is it&rsquo;s a bit like an internal Facebook. So the amounts of emails that we now get has reduced.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve done some measurements and we&rsquo;ve actually worked out that the efficiency of employees has increased by about 25%. We have 100,000 employees worldwide, so we&rsquo;ve gained something like 25,000 employees. And what we do is we collaborate, and we collaborate across teams. So whereas in the past, marketing used to sit in the silo and sales were in the silo, now we basically cooperate and work together. For example, every single marketing event, we create will be the equivalent of a Facebook group, and the people that need to be on that group get in there and they collaborate and provide their opinion. And we found that has been quite game-changing in the way that we work.</p><p> Connect with Tim on Twitter  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Timothy_Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @Timothy_Hughes  </a> </u>  and check out his  <u>  <a href=\"https://timothyhughesuk.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Great news for older workers considering a career change &ndash; those who&rsquo;ve done it are happier and less stressed.</p><p> People who attempted a career change sometime after turning 45 were  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aier.org/new-careers-older-workers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   surveyed  </a> </u>  last year by the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) in Massachusetts.  Whatever the reason for making a change &ndash; voluntary or forced &ndash; the majority of those who did so felt their results were successful.</p><p> These late-career changers need to be put in a larger perspective.  Older workers are much more likely to stay put in a job than are younger people moving up the ladder, and older people also have a tougher time recovering and finding a new full-time job after becoming unemployed.</p><p> <strong>  But when older workers can change their employment, the outcomes are positive. </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I feel like a new person&rdquo; &ndash; 72 percent of job changers agreed with this statement, while 65 percent said their stress levels fell, according to the AIER.  There are also downsides to late-career transitions: a hefty minority of those surveyed advised others taking this path to be open-minded about their working hours and lower compensation, though half of those surveyed said their pay eventually increased in their new jobs.</p><p> &ldquo;If you feel you need a change, then do it,&rdquo; one survey respondent commented.</p><p> This survey provides a fresh take on a comprehensive 2009  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/older-workers-move-recareering-later-life/view/full_report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AARP-Urban Institute  </a> </u>  study that reached similar conclusions.  The AARP-Urban study found that many older workers tend to move into less prestigious jobs when they make a change.  For example, managers often take non-management positions, which could partly explain why the share of people who said they felt stressed about their work dropped by almost half after a late-career change, from 65 percent to 36 percent.</p><p> This study didn&rsquo;t distinguish between transitions to full- and part-time work in its analysis. However, only about one-third of people who left employers voluntarily or were laid off went part-time; people were more likely to choose part-time if they returned to work after retiring.</p><p> The study analyzed late-career changing, based on the type of older workers:</p><p> <strong>  Education: </strong>  People without a high school education are less likely to change careers.  When they leave the labor force it tends to be permanent. People with graduate degrees are also less likely to change careers, because they &ldquo;have accumulated specialized knowledge and skills that may be difficult to utilize in new careers.&rdquo; However, just among people who retired but later returned to work, more education improves the likelihood of finding a new job.</p><p> <strong>  Wealth: </strong>  Late-career transitions are unusual for people in households with more than $300,000 in wealth. One reason may be that they can afford to retire.</p><p> <strong>  Gender: </strong>  Older men are slightly more likely to make a career change than are older women. &ldquo;Re-careering&rdquo; is also less common among Hispanics, union workers, and people with health problems. It is also less common among older workers with traditional pensions and retiree health benefits, perhaps because they are more prepared financially to retire.</p><p> To read profiles of two retirees who went back to work,  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/a-short-lived-retirement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click here  </a> </u> .</p><p> For a profile of an &ldquo;anti-retirement advocate,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/an-anti-retirement-advocate/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click here  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  A recent Deutsche Bank report projects a total airline industry first-quarter pretax profit of $3.5 billion, five times the $700 million pretax profit this time last year. </strong></p><p> The bank estimates that nearly 110 percent of the earnings gain will derive from lower fuel prices. It states that &ldquo;the industry over the past several years has demonstrated its ability to successfully offset most, if not all, of the rise in fuel expense via a combination of cost savings and various revenue initiatives.&rdquo;</p><p> Looking ahead to the end of the year, Deutsche Bank sees airlines generating $24.7 billion in operating income, or the money that remains after certain operating expenses are paid such as research and development, wages, maintenance and the like.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-29-at-12.32.34-PM.png\" width=\"609\"/></p><p> As we all know, oil has fallen nearly 50 percent since last summer, and jet fuel prices have followed closely at its heels, declining to multi-year lows. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA,) airlines worldwide are expected to spend $71 billion on fuel in 2015, a savings of $84 billion compared to 2014.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-29-at-12.32.38-PM.png\" width=\"616\"/></p><h3> Efficiency Leading the Way</h3><p> <br/> An important metric Deutsche Bank uses to illustrate that the industry is in expansion mode is operating margin, which measures a company&rsquo;s efficiency in generating revenue. This figure tells you how much of each dollar earned the company keeps as profit after taxes. Generally speaking, the higher the number, the more efficiently the company is being run and the more capital it can use to pay down debt and return to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.</p><p> Because of fuel cost savings, all 11 of the companies below are expected to increase margins by the end of 2015.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-29-at-12.50.15-PM.png\" width=\"616\"/></p><p> The carrier expected to see the greatest increase is Las Vegas-based Allegiant Air, the ultra-low-cost regional carrier that focuses on underserved cities. The company provides a &ldquo;complete travel experience&rdquo; that allows customers to book hotel stays and car rentals on top of flights.</p><p> Claiming the highest margins last year was Spirit Airlines, the carrier known for its &ldquo;Bare Fare&rdquo; pricing structure. Even though it offers some of the lowest prices in the industry&mdash;they&rsquo;re 40 percent lower than the competition on average&mdash;Spirit is able to maintain these margins because of its stripped-down, no-frills service and experience.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"255\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-29-at-12.50.21-PM.png\" width=\"615\"/></p><p> Spirit certainly has grounds to justify this highly-frugal business model. In a June 2014 survey, close to 1,500 air travelers were asked what they considered first when looking to purchase an airline ticket. Fifty percent of respondents cited price as the most decisive factor, whereas only 3 percent said it was legroom.</p><h3> Earnings Season</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  A few airlines have already reported on first-quarter earnings, and so far most have beaten analysts&rsquo; expectations. </strong></p><p> <strong>  American Airlines </strong> , which was  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11009\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   recently added to the S&amp;P 500  </u>  , </a>  reported a record net profit of $1.2 billion, or $1.73 per share. This is a tripling of the carrier&rsquo;s net profits in the first quarter of last year.</p><p> American CEO Doug Parker is so bullish on his company that he has asked to be compensated solely in company stock going forward.</p><p> <strong>  Delta </strong> , which we own in our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Holmes Macro Trends Fund (MEGAX)  </u>  , </a>  reported higher-than-expected earnings&mdash;$0.45 per share&mdash;with an average beat of 5.11 percent over the last four quarters. This marks the company&rsquo;s eighth consecutive quarter of record profits.</p><p> <strong>  Alaska Air&rsquo;s </strong>  EPS came in at $1.12, with earnings up 75 percent on a year-over-year basis. The company reported record first-quarter net income of $149 million, a 67-percent increase from last year. During the quarter, the company also bought back $102 million worth of common stock and paid a $0.20 per-share dividend.</p><p> We own Alaska Air in MEGAX.</p><p> <strong>  Southwest </strong>  reported record profits of $453 million&mdash;or $0.66 per share, beating consensus by one penny&mdash;up from $152 million in the first quarter last year.</p><p> <strong>  United Continental </strong>  reported record first-quarter profits of $582 million, earning $1.52 per share, beating estimates of $1.44. The company paid back $200 million to shareholders in its proposed $1 billion share buyback program.</p><p> Finally,  <strong>  Allegiant </strong>  also posted a record quarterly EPS of $3.74, up from $1.86 last year.

    "content": "<strong> For budding entrepreneurs, &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; is a pop culture phenomenon that made venture capital more accessible to the masses.</strong>Yes, there is some reality-show forced drama, but anything that gives audiences at least a passing understanding of valuations, equity stakes and market placement can&rsquo;t be all bad.There are also clear lessons in the value of partnerships to be learned from the interactions of the entrepreneurs and investors during the pitch process.  It turns out that the &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; invest more often in business who come in to pitch as a partnership.  Analysis of the deals show that co-founders (two or more) were far more likely to close a deal than solo entrepreneurs (44% of solo entrepreneurs close a deal vs. 58% with two co-founders.)The reason for this may be as simple as the difficulty in getting a full \"skill set\" for a start-up in one person (tech and business management skills, for example.) While there can be a sole founder and a team to fill in other needed skills, there is some research indicating that two co-founders is optimal. Presumably, this is because two partners can have complementary skill sets, but not the complexity andopportunity for conflict you may get with more partners. However, it may also be something more qualitative: there is a higher likelihood that funders will feel an affinity for at least one of the founders and feel that they can deal with them successfully.<h3> The Sharks sometimes make this explicit in taking the deal.</h3>In a recent segment Barbara Corcoran commented that she did not like one of the partners, but luckily she liked the other one a lot or would not have made the deal.  Given the importance of this relationship it is axiomatic that a business partnership is something to be fostered and protected, much like a marriage. Actually, Corcoran has often compared the partnerships she sees on Shark Tank with her marriage saying they both require &ldquo;respect and endurance.&rdquo;",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Meetings are a necessary part of office life. </strong> They can help your team reach an important decision, or build consensus on a critical issue. Meetings may also be helpful when you just need to talk things through as a group.</p><p> However, meetings can also be time killers. Here are some smart ways to reduce the amount of time you spend in meetings.</p><h3> Create an agenda&hellip; and stick to it</h3><p> <br/> Every so often, you just need a good brainstorming session. If it&rsquo;s not one of those times, have a solid agenda for your meeting. Circulate it at least a couple of days ahead of time, and encourage people to ask questions or suggest changes as soon as they get the agenda. Don&rsquo;t save these things for the meeting, or you won&rsquo;t stay on track.</p><p> What should go into your agenda? A list of what topics you plan to discuss, who will be leading each discussion and how much time will be spent on each topic. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. The bigger challenge is often sticking to the agenda once the meeting has started.</p><p> Of course, you&rsquo;ll want enough time in your agenda for relevant questions and discussion. But if a discussion starts to veer off topic, it should be moved out of the meeting and discussed at another time. As the meeting organizer, it&rsquo;s up to you to enforce this.</p><p> Also, make sure you start your meeting on time. There is no bigger time killer than spending 10 to 15 minutes at the beginning of a meeting waiting for all the key players to arrive. Start on time and stick to your agenda, and you&rsquo;ll be more likely to end your meeting on time, too.</p><h3> Invite fewer people</h3><p> <br/> Does it ever feel like you&rsquo;re having a meeting just because everyone wants a say on a certain decision that needs to be made? Even when that decision isn&rsquo;t particularly relevant to their role. It happens to all of us.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll cut your meeting time down significantly by inviting only the people who really need to be there. Others may be interested in what&rsquo;s being discussed, and that&rsquo;s great! We all want an engaged workforce. After the meeting, send those people a summary of what was discussed and what decisions were made, and let them know you&rsquo;re happy to have their input.</p><p> Other times, you&rsquo;ll find the opposite is happening. Somebody has a big decision to make and doesn&rsquo;t really feel comfortable doing it without everyone else&rsquo;s input. Most issues aren&rsquo;t this critical. When each employee&rsquo;s role is clearly defined, and they feel empowered to make important decisions within that role, you may find you need far fewer meetings.</p><p> In other words, don&rsquo;t use meetings as an exercise in hand-holding or passing the decision-making buck to the next person. If it seems like this is what&rsquo;s happening, try a quick phone call or one-on-one chat instead.</p><h3> Try standing</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t hate us for this one, but a 1999 study from the University of Missouri showed that meetings are 34% shorter if you&rsquo;re standing up ( <a href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/05/work-smarter-for-shorter-meetings-stand-up.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  source </a> ). True, it&rsquo;s a 15-year-old study, but we have a feeling the results still stand today (see what we did there?).</p><p> Try taking away the chairs during your next meeting. Allow us to state the obvious and say that standing is harder than sitting. People will be less likely to veer off-topic during a standing meeting, because they&rsquo;ll really want to get back to their desks.</p><p> You might want to make an exception for the person responsible for taking notes during the meeting. And you&rsquo;ll definitely want to make an exception for anyone who can&rsquo;t stand for 30 minutes. But try this one out, at least once, and let us know how it goes.</p>",

PHYSICAL RESILIENCE.</h3><p> <br/> Many people are stagnant in life because they are physically stagnant. The answer: don&rsquo;t sit still all day.  Physical movement actively improves your body &amp; brain.</p><p> <strong>  Do it: </strong>  Vow to get up from your desk each hour of your workday.</p><h3> 3. EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE.</h3><p> <br/> When feeling down, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that you have the ability to invoke positive feelings on command. If you can actively tap into things that make you happy, you will dramatically improve your mood and ability to tackle challenges. Researchers often refer to the 3:1 Positive Emotion Ratio. For every negative thought, actively choose to have 3 positive thoughts to improve your overall health &amp; happiness.</p><p> <strong>  Do it: </strong>  Look up a YouTube video of your favorite baby animal.</p><h3> 4. SOCIAL RESILIENCE.</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s strength in numbers, so why not reach out? Instead of isolating, connect with your friends, family and community.</p><p> <strong>  Do it: </strong>  Express gratitude by sending someone a thank you note/email/text.</p><p> <strong>  Bonus: </strong>  Embrace the power of touch. Shaking someone&rsquo;s hand for 6 seconds increases your level of Oxytocin (the feel good &amp; bonding hormone)</p><h3> The Takeaway:</h3><p> <br/> You determine the rate of your growth. Don&rsquo;t wait for a rock-bottom.  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/consultation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Do it on your terms  </u>  . </a></p>",

    "title": "Advisors: Trust Your Clients - Don't Fear the Question",
    "link": "advisors-trust-your-clients-dont-fear-the-question",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I am just wrapping up a very busy client advisory board season (yes, it turns out there is a seasonality to advisory boards). I had the experience several times of firms that had significant issues they could have brought to their boards and decided not to. One even cancelled their meeting outright. They were afraid of how their boards would respond to the issues we were discussing. And I believe they represent lost opportunities.</p><p> In some cases it was recent or pending changes in personnel, like a principal departing the firm. In some cases it was a reluctance to discuss a potential new service offering. In others it was asking about client involvement in a particular initiative. &ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t want that questions to come up&rdquo; I was told. I disagree. Don&rsquo;t fear the question.</p><p> In each of these cases, I believe the firms could have received valuable guidance and strengthened relationships with some of their top clients had they brought the issues to them. Let&rsquo;s examine some of the reasons advisors are afraid to discuss these topics and the couple ideas on how to address them productively.</p><h3> Why advisors fear issues</h3><p> <br/> In my experience, there are three main concerns that prevent advisors from bringing issues to their client advisory boards:</p><p> <strong>  They believe board members will be offended </strong>  &ndash; Advisors would tell me that we cannot suggest that idea to the advisory board because they will be insulted by the concept. Sometimes I get the impression that advisors feel like getting clients involved in a marketing idea, for example, is equivalent to offering a man a large sum of money to sleep with his wife. It is practically never that way. Provided you craft the question with care, clients are generally happy to discuss the idea and are frequently honored that you would ask. As long as you don&rsquo;t implement over their objection. Go into it being open to the answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; from the board and you should be fine.</p><p> <strong>  They fear it will show weakness  </strong> &ndash; I think this is an entrepreneur thing. They fear that any deviation from a tightly controlled script will be interpreted by clients as the situation being wildly out of control. All businesses evolve, develop, and have setbacks. Your clients have more faith in you than you think. And they want to help. You advise them on planning for the unexpected. Do you really believe they would be shocked that something unexpected happened to you? Employees, even partners, leave once in a while. Sometimes you make a bad hire. Investments sometimes don&rsquo;t pan out. Marketing plans fail. It happens. Everybody knows it. Involving your clients in working through your response to the unexpected is an act of commitment to them and will earn you loyalty in return.</p><p> <strong>  They won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t deliver  </strong> &ndash; One of the most common misplaced fears I hear from advisors is that the advisory board will tell them to do something that they cannot or do not want to do. Putting a question to your advisory board does not commit you to action &ndash; at least you should not structure it that way. Your promise to the client advisory board should be to give serious consideration to any feedback they offer you. If there is a way to improve their experience that makes good business sense, you will do everything you can to figure out how to implement it. It is not &ldquo;whatever you say I will do.&rdquo; And if you are diligent about making improvements in your business based on their guidance you will build enough trust capital to turn down some of their requests without losing their loyalty. Structure the questions the right way and set the expectations appropriately and it will not be a problem. You can report back to the advisory board on how you considered their feedback and why you decided not to pursue it and, as long as that does not happen all the time, the board will be fine with it.</p><h3> Guide to moving forward</h3><p> <br/> Here are a few principles to take the fear out of taking sensitive issues to your advisory board.</p><p> <strong>  Ask the right kinds of questions </strong>  &ndash; This will influence the success of your client advisory board more than any other issue. Start with asking open ended questions rather than closed ended. (A closed end question is one that can be answered with a yes or no.) Instead of asking &ldquo;should I do this?&rdquo; ask &ldquo;how valuable would this be to you&rdquo; or &ldquo;how much would you utilize a service like this if we offered it?&rdquo; Ask questions about the client experience and how it can be improved. Ask board members about how something might affect their personal experience of your firm not how they anticipate other people would experience or respond to things. Avoid questions clients are not qualified to answer.</p><p> <strong>  Set appropriate expectations and don&rsquo;t overpromise </strong>  &ndash; Let the board know what you plan on doing with the information. Let them know who else will have input. And let them know that while you will give their feedback serious consideration, it is still your responsibility to make decisions about your business.</p><p> <strong>  Ask questions only about things you are willing to change </strong>  &ndash; If you have no intention of making a change to a particular service or aspect of your business, don&rsquo;t ask for feedback. If you are thinking about a new logo, for example, and you are willing to consider the opinions of your advisory board, get them involved in the evaluation. If there is one new logo you love and you&rsquo;re going to go with it regardless of what anyone else thinks, don&rsquo;t pretend they are part of the decision making process. Maybe give them a preview before it is unveiled to the public. If you are determined to roll out a new service, ask them about how you can best communicate it or what they think would get people talking about it, but do not ask them whether you should do it. If you are open to their guidance on whether or not to introduce that service then bring it up as an issue. One advisor I worked with had been working for the better part of a year on developing a variation on a college planning service. We brought it to their advisory board. The participants liked the idea but indicated they would not be willing to pay much to get it. The advisor ditched the idea, and it likely saved them thousands of dollars rolling out a service that would have failed. I spoke to another advisor not long ago who said his board kept making requests that he refused to implement. I suggested to him that if it were a repeated pattern it probably indicated a poor facilitator and he admitted that he was trying to run it himself. But the point is that they repeatedly discussed ideas the advisor was not willing to consider. Eventually, the board disbanded.</p><p> <strong>  Be judicious about committing to action </strong>  &ndash; Sometimes it is appropriate to decide a course of action at the conclusion of a discussion during a client advisory board meeting. More often it is not. There are still facts to be gathered, analysis to be performed, and other people to get input from. So rather than making a promise to take a specific action at the end of the discussion, promised to consider their feedback and report back to them at the next meeting.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t fear the question.</h3><p> <br/> Trust the process. And trust your clients &ndash; they want to help you succeed. Posing the right questions and setting the right expectations means you never have to fear your clients&rsquo; feedback.</p>",

    "link": "why-i-disagree-with-jack-welch",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Recently on CNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Jack and Suzy Welch </strong> talked about their new book,The Real-Life MBA: Your No-BS Guide to Winning the Game, Building a Team, and Growing Your Career.  </p><p> While I haven't read the book yet (although I did order it), I enjoyed the interview. The discussion focused on how employee engagement in American business is at an all-time low.   This particularly caught my attention because this is a topic that we have presented to audiences around the country for several years now.  </p><h3> The numbers truly are alarming.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  According to Gallup's 2014 \"State of the American Workplace\" survey, 70 percent of U.S. workers are not engaged at work.  </strong> This disengagement costs the U.S. $450 to $550 billion in lost production each year because employees are emotionally disconnected from the workplace.</p><p> Jack and Suzy discussed how the numbers of an unsatisfied workforce are dire.   They also said the impact it will have on our global economy may be staggering.  These points, I completely agree with.  </p><p> They also spoke eloquently about the two principles of successful leadership today, which aretruthandtrust.  I agree wholeheartedly.  For organizations to have impactful leadership, leaders must be truthful - truthful to themselves, their teams and the public.  This may be difficult in large, public companies or for those seeking to gain only publicity and career \"advancement.\"  But truthfulness, defined as \"no spin,\" will allow an organization to move quickly, earn trust and gain public support.  Truthfulness leads to trust.  </p><p> I was particularly intrigued when Joe Scarborough asked Jack Welch if this \"new\" unengaged employee phenomenon has existed for the last 40 years.  His response truly surprised me.  It was \"no.\"  He said that the disengaged employee problem is a result of the 2008 recession.  He continued to explain that business has become \"no fun.\"  </p><p> Even though the Gallup research may support Welch's view, this is where I respectfully disagree with Jack Welch.  I believe that some things worth measuring are un-measurable, and some things that are measurable, don't matter!</p><p> While I do agree that the 2008 recession did create havoc both in the marketplace and in Americans' personal lives, I don't believe the challenges we face with emotionally disconnected employees are a direct result of the recession.</p><h3> Think about it. </h3><p> <br/> If business and business success can only be \"fun\" when those things that can be measured are strong and profitable, then who is to say when \"tough times\" come our way, life is unproductive, no fun and worth getting unengaged in?  I believe that happiness and engagement are not simply about money and the state of the economy.  There are plenty of Americans who love what they do and don't receive the big pay checks of corporate America or Wall Street, yet they are fully engaged and happy in their work.  I believe this is not a capitalism challenge, this is a human capital challenge.</p><p> In order to create a truly engaged workforce, I believe it takes both strong leadership and focusing on creating intimacy with employees, which takes truthfulness and vulnerability.  When you have a culture and work environment that fosters intimacy, having purpose and a feeling of connectedness among employees, you will increase employee engagement.  As a result, employee production and organizational health will increase, regardless of the economic environment.  Let's start measuring what's worth measuring and not just measure the bottom line!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Lots of fuss in tech land this week as \"Mobilegeddon\" hit. Or to put it less dramatically, Google announced it was &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   boosting the ranking of mobile-friendly pages on mobile search results  </a> </u> &rdquo;.  In effect websites that aren't mobile-friendly may suffer against websites that look and perform better on mobile devices (responsive design).  </p><p> For professional services and wealth management firms if your website is more than three or so years old, it may well still come up easily when clients or potential clients Google for your firm&rsquo;s name specifically, but you may find yourself becoming less visible if your company name sounds rather like another company&rsquo;s (common for financial advice firms) and against general keyword searches. </p><p> Does this matter?  \"Most of my business comes through personal referral\"  I hear you say and yes good professional services firms thrive primarily through referral from happy clients and productive relationships with other professionals, but research shows that most will check you out online before coming to see you either by going straight to your website (c.80% of people) or by Googling you (roughly two thirds). According to research by US consultancy Hinge, fewer than 1% of people don't check you out at all.</p><p> So in light of recent developments and given that as I write this the sun is shining and the last of the daffodils are shriving in a vase by my PC, perhaps now is a good time to  <strong>  spring clean your website&rsquo;s title tags and URLs </strong> , and if it&rsquo;s not yet mobile friendly (see Google&rsquo;s page tester  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u>  and picture) it might be time to consider a rebuild.</p><p> As a final thought, when someone Googles you, generally speaking your website will come up first but the next result is usually your LinkedIn  <u>  company page </u>  because LinkedIn has such strong organic search engine optimisation in its own right.  So to belt and braces things, if you haven't updated your company page recently, do, or if you can't remember whose job it is internally, now might be a good time to review your internal processes! The same goes for  <u>  <a href=\"/category/grow/development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google+  </a> </u>  by the way, even if you haven&rsquo;t yet got to grips with sharing content on it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Kudos to my friend Chris Barrows on his blog for Millennial CEO, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://millennialceo.com/personal-development/lost-art/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Lost Art of Hello  </u>  . </a> &rdquo; As he states in the post, we often find ourselves in this tech-drenched life unable to unplug from our wearables long enough to engage in simple human interaction. We learned (or should have learned) basic greetings as children, but even saying the word &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to people has become a challenge. And this phenomenon isn&rsquo;t limited to the Millennial generation who were born with earphones permanently attached to their heads&mdash;this is everybody. We&rsquo;ve allowed technology to inure us to everything outside the invisible bubbles we build around ourselves when we plug into our gadgets.</p><p> I remember even a dozen years ago hearing older generations fuss about teenagers who ignore everyone around them when they listen to music or play video games. &ldquo;Kids these days&mdash;they don&rsquo;t look up anymore&mdash;you can&rsquo;t even get them to look you in the eye or be nice!&rdquo;</p><h3> The problem started with technology and is growing bigger as technology progresses</h3><p> <br/> Does the fact that we all carry our offices in our pockets or on our wrists suddenly make it ok not to be polite to those around us? Of course not! Being &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean we should throw common civility and manners out the window, yet it&rsquo;s happening more and more. People have to be reminded to pay attention to the needs of others these days&mdash;to turn off their cell phones at the movies, during conferences and in the grocery line.  They make less eye contact with others in the elevator, the subway, on the street or even in the office. Have you noticed that the nod and smile acknowledgement we used to give and receive numerous times a day has gone by the wayside? Rudeness has become an accepted norm.</p><h3> We&rsquo;re blaming all this on technology, but it&rsquo;s really more about forgetting how to be human</h3><p> <br/> Tech doesn&rsquo;t take it away from us, we take it away from ourselves. What&rsquo;s really alarming is that there&rsquo;s even a new &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; associated with over-use of tech known as NetBrain or iDisorder, and psychologists claim it makes one in 10 people into &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2902137/Do-suffer-NETBRAIN-Psychologists-claim-tech-makes-one-10-anti-social-distracted-narcissists.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   anti-social, distracted narcissists  </a> </u> .&rdquo; Of the 8.4 million people living in New York, that means 840,000 could be afflicted. Wow&mdash;that&rsquo;s a lot of anti-social behavior!</p><p> C&rsquo;mon, people, there&rsquo;s a cure for this, and it comes down to re-learning some things and setting some new standards.  Apart from breaking out the etiquette books and teaching our children the basics of manners and how to interact with people in face-to-face situations, we need to learn how to look people in the eye digitally. This is a mindset and it is up t you. It&rsquo;s not difficult to do, but it does take time and effort and practice (LOTS of practice). And it&rsquo;s worth every minute because it&rsquo;s just unacceptable to sacrifice human connectedness on the altar of technological progress&hellip; and it will pay dividends to the people and brands who make that connection and doing so part of their corporate culture.</p><h3> Relationships are like muscle tissue</h3><p> <br/> There needs to be more of an effort on everyone&rsquo;s part (including developers) to consciously embed human touch opportunities whenever and wherever possible. After all, technology is only useful as long as it enhances our ability to form and foster relationships with each other. The rest is up to us because&hellip; Relationships are like muscle tissue&mdash;the more they&rsquo;re engaged, the stronger and more valuable they become. Besides&hellip;as far as I know, there&rsquo;s no drug that will break an addiction to tech or help you avoid being a jerk. It&rsquo;s up to you to break that cycle and remember to &ldquo;#JustBeNice&rdquo; to those around you.</p><p> Chris says he&rsquo;s going to take me up on my challenge to take off the headphones and say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to more people, and I look forward to hearing his results. How about you? In what ways have you put #justbenice into practice?  #RonR.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobwillia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bob Williams  </a> </u>  </p><h3> Five tips to consider before signing a vlogger</h3><p> YouTube and video bloggers, or &ldquo;vloggers,&rdquo; have become increasingly popular over the last few years. In fact, according to a recent survey by  Variety  magazine, YouTube stars are more popular among U.S. teens than mainstream celebrities.</p><p> Many brands have taken notice to this trend, and have started recruiting these stars to help promote products through their channels. For example, using a beauty vlogger to endorse a cosmetic product can result in a great deal of recognition for a brand.</p><p> Similar to big name celebrities, there are various things to consider before hiring a social media star to endorse your brand or product. Keep this advice in mind when considering work with a YouTube star:</p><li> It is difficult to get vloggers to post endorsement videos to their own channels vs. the brand&rsquo;s channel. YouTube celebrities have frequently stated that their fans don&rsquo;t like to see videos focused on a specific product. Often times, dedicated videos look too similar to advertisements which can result in negative feedback for vloggers and in-turn, the brand.</li><li> The bigger names in the industry are incredibly competitive and want to continue being at the top of their game. The vlogger may want approval over everyone and everything that is put in the video, as well as editorial freedom to discuss other brands regardless of paid partnerships. Therefore, it may be beneficial to hire a few smaller name vloggers who are more flexible, than one big name.</li><li> In categories such as beauty, it is not likely for a brand to get exclusivity. Vloggers make up to five figures per video, so depending on the category, for them to strictly represent one brand will likely be cost prohibitive. At the same time, many of these star&rsquo;s popularity stems from their personal creativity and freedom of speech, so they aren&rsquo;t looking to be under continual contracts.</li><li> YouTube celebrities can be very particular about keeping branded content consistent with the other content posted to their channel. For example, if vloggers do not usually post animated content/graphics in their videos, they may be less inclined to participate in the proposed campaign.</li><li> Often in high demand, YouTube celebrities and their content calendars book up months in advance. The sooner you are able to carve out a desired shoot, schedule, and launch date, the better chance you have of recruiting them.</li>",

    "content": "<p> Life is busy and maybe even overwhelming at times. Work, family, friends, hitting the gym, scheduling and taxi service for your kids&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lot. Finding time to dig into the meat of your finances can be a battle you ignore at your peril.</p><p> Clearing space to understand your money begins with recognition that the pressure of ignoring the warning signs is building to a boiling point; at which point, change is essential.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re at the cross-over point.</h3><p> <br/> Do you stay in fear or discomfort or do you move to a more satisfying place of gaining control? If getting more involved with your financial life will provide you with greater comfort, security and peace of mind, than it&rsquo;s time for some changes.</p><p> If your schedule is indeed packed with truly unmovable activities, than outsourcing is key. If you don&rsquo;t need or want to outsource everything, than focus on those areas that are most time demanding, technical or that make you want to poke a stick in your eye.</p><p> How to prepare for positive change? Try looking at it this way:</p><p> <strong>  1. Cop the right attitude: </strong> Dealing with money issues can be anywhere from a terrible strain to a positive, self-satisfying process. Remember, the goal is to enhance your life so that you feel more secure, satisfied and empowered. A great attitude makes all the difference.</p><p> <strong>  2. Get smart: </strong> Whether you&rsquo;re approaching this with a solid foundation of financial wisdom or you are just starting out, knowledge is power. Where do you go to find good information? <u>  <a href=\"http://napfa.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NAPFA.org  </a> </u> , <u>  <a href=\"http://fpanet.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FPAnet.org  </a> </u> , <u>  <a href=\"http://360financialliteracy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   360finanicalliteracy.org  </a> </u> , <u>  <a href=\"http://financiallit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financiallit.org  </a> </u> are great places to start. These sites are filled with information that can help you fill in your knowledge gap or provide bedrock information to support your learning. </p><p> <strong>  3. Choose the right time: </strong> If you have been struggling just to get your bills paid (or pull together your records at tax time), adding more to the agony is going to be a challenge. So pick a time when your energy is high&mdash;when you&rsquo;re feeling strong and ready. <br/>  </p><h3> Taking control of your money life is like eating an elephant.</h3><p> <br/> How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Start small and build confidence in your ability. Think of it like lifting weights&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to build up those muscles before you tackle any heavy lifting.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you are building a spending plan and your goal is to master your budget. Make it a weekly event where you match up your expected income and expenses with your actual performance for the week. Actively take your surpluses and put them toward your goals&mdash;debt reduction or wealth building&mdash;each week. Every success builds your confidence AND your net worth.</p><p> Making time to get more deeply involved in your money life is an exercise in discipline and empowerment. Be gentle with yourself&mdash;even if you have an MBA in Finance, chances are you don&rsquo;t have the depth of personal finance experience to handle some of the trickier questions that pop up.</p><p> Keep your expectations reasonable, start small and don&rsquo;t be afraid to call in professional reinforcements when you need them.  After all, you want to devote time to the activities that give you the most joy AND build your financial comfort too.</p>",

We do this because most firms and individuals in this sector are limited in marketing, and have little or no modern marketing experience. This creates a significant opportunity for individual advisers or firms who wish to grow their client banks, funds under management and regular income. </p><p> Below are two proven processes that, if implemented correctly, will build client interest and grow your firms funds under management.</p><h3> Outbound Prospecting</h3><p> <br/> Whether you are an individual adviser, or manage a team of advisers, social channels such as Linkedin give you an abundance of contacts to engage with and nurture into clients. Through our  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/outbound-prospecting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Outbound Prospecting </a>  service we manage our clients' social accounts on their behalf to target a pre-agreed client type within their geographical area. We will create an engaging and relevant message process aimed at attracting the interest of your target market, converting a proportion into your clients. This process will include the following:</p><li> Initial message - our copywriters create a persuading message to generate interest from High Net Worth individuals.</li><li> A second engaging message will be sent several days later should we not receive a response from the above initial message.</li><li> Several further messages that deal with prospects objections, Normal objection replies we receive are, I already have an adviser, I have no time, or no need. Our responses to these objections have been developed over time to nurture further positive interest from prospects. <br/>  </li><p> We send messages and engage with approximately 2000 targeted prospects per month. We will manage the conversation on your behalf and generate an appointment (face to face or telephone) for you to generate business and grow funds under management.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/outbound-prospecting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click Here to Download our Outbound Prospecting Process  </a> </u></p><h3> Automation Marketing</h3><p> <br/> Automation marketing is one of the most effective forms of marketing and client generation processes in the financial sector. For those prospects that do not engage at the time of prospecting we will ask them to register for your newsletter (which we will create and manage).</p><p> Once added to your newsletter prospects will enter into an email workflow process. This is a pre-agreed number of email messages spaced out over time. Each message is personalised and designed to increase interest and a need for each prospect to take action and create engagement.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/automated-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   For more information on Automation Marketing, click here to watch our video and experience automation marketing at work  </a> </u></p>",

    "link": "your-perfect-relationship-why-women-need-to-get-intimate-with-money",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meridithpowell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meridith Powell  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.meridithelliottpowell.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MERIDITH ELLIOTT POWELL  </a> </u></p><h3> Are you looking for that perfect relationship?</h3><p> <br/> One that provides security, one in which true communication is a priority, and one that even offers a touch of the finer things in life? If so, I suggest you get a little closer to your money! All kidding aside, building a strong and healthy relationship with your finances is one of the best ways you can invest in your future. Ironically, though, it is the one relationship women often make little time for or end up ignoring all together.</p><p> When I was growing up, the role of the woman was to raise the children and run the household. Earning the money, paying the bills, and planning for retirement was men&rsquo;s work. Times have obviously changed, and while women still typically take the lead in household decision-making, we are staking our claim in the workforce as well. With many couples marrying later in life, more women prioritizing their careers, and the divorce rate holding steady, women are beginning understand the importance of financial independence.</p><p> That said, while studies show that more women than ever are involved in the family finances &ndash; creating the budget, handling the bills, and balancing the checkbook&mdash;many women are still either ignorant of or inactive in real financial management: the type of involvement that seriously impacts their future and that of their children <a href=\"http://www.meridithelliottpowell.com/your-perfect-relationship-why-women-need-to-get-intimate-with-money/#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a> . Sadly, the reason for this is that women tend to feel that they lack the knowledge or time to truly invest in the major areas of financial responsibility.</p><p> Contrary to popular belief, financial management fits the description of &ldquo;women&rsquo;s work&rdquo; just as easily as it does men&rsquo;s. The reason is that whether you are single or married, young or &ldquo;mature&rdquo;, male or female, understanding your finances is a personal responsibility. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nine out of every ten women will assume sole responsibility for their financial well-being at some point in their lives. It is important to be prepared with the knowledge, skills, and support necessary to successfully navigate that time period.</p><p> <strong>  Q: Why is understanding your money important, and why do women need to establish an active relationship with their finances? </strong></p><p> A:</p><li> <strong>  Women live an average of 7 years longer than men. </strong> This means we will need at least 20% more saved up for retirement to support us during those years.</li><li> <strong>  On average, women earn 25% less than men </strong> , making saving for retirement more challenging for women.</li><li> <strong>  Because women are typically the ones who take time off to raise their children </strong> and are for aging parents, we end up saving less for retirement than men do.</li><li> <strong>  After years of earning salaries that are 25% lower than men&rsquo;s </strong> , our social security benefits end up paying lesser amounts than men&rsquo;s.</li><li> <strong>  Many women were not raised to take an active role in their finances </strong> , and these women may fear addressing financial concerns.</li><li> <strong>  Women are starting new companies at twice the rate of men </strong> , making our understanding of money critical not only to our personal success but also to that of our overall economy. <br/>  </li><p> These issues may be tough to confront but they are not insurmountable if we, as women, build awareness of our financial situation and take an active role in managing our money. Here&rsquo;s how we can start:</p><li> <strong>  Go Deep  </strong> &ndash; Take an honest assessment of what you do and don&rsquo;t understand about money. Ask yourself tough questions: How much do I earn? What do I spend? Do I have a budget? What is my plan for retirement? The answers don&rsquo;t matter; what matters is that you remain brutally honest in order to dive deep and determine where you&rsquo;re starting.</li><li> <strong>  Take Control  </strong> &ndash; Commit to becoming financially strong and literate. Find a professional that you like, want to work with, and that you feel you can talk to, and work together to create a plan.</li><li> <strong>  Find A Buddy </strong>  &ndash; You know that friend who holds you accountable to eat right and exercise? You need a friend like that for financial support as well. The best accountability system is a friend, someone who has the same goals and values as you do.</li><li> <strong>  Commit To Learning </strong>  &ndash; Last but not least, take action by committing to learning as much as you can. Understanding and planning for your money is YOUR job. While you will find great professional help to support you, it&rsquo;s also important to take a class, read some books, and watch endless YouTube videos about financial management. In other words, take charge of your money! <br/>  </li>1 According to <a href=\"http://www.msmoney.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> www.msmoney.com</a>.<p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Last year,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-your-business-needs-a-social-media-management-tool-like-hootsuite/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we discussed the merits of HootSuite  </a> </u>  for social media marketers. While we do still use HootSuite and find value in their social media tools, we prefer to use Sprout Social for most of our needs. Here are eight reasons why  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/sproutsocial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sprout Social  </a> </u>  is a MUST-HAVE for anyone looking to save time, collect more data, and market more efficiently.</p><h3> 1. Control functions through an even more user-friendly dash!</h3><p> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/hootsuite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HootSuite </a>  organizes functions through a fairly user-friendly spreadsheet format, but we prefer the cleaner, more streamlined look of Sprout Social&rsquo;s tabbed dashboard. It&rsquo;s easy to click and manage the main categories: Messages, Tasks, Feeds, Publishing, Discovery, and Reports. Instead of looking at a lot of little columns, you work in a larger window that is easier on the eyes.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-02-at-8.49.26-AM.png\" width=\"635\"/></p><h3> 2. Get all your messages in a single stream.</h3><p> Connect your  <u>  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+MandyMcEwen\" target=\"_blank\">   Google+  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mandymodgirl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mandymodgirl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook  </a> </u>  posts delivered to your Sprout Social inbox in one stream. You can still filter your messages by profile, if you prefer, but if you&rsquo;re just looking for the most up-to-date messages, the  <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-inbox/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Smart Inbox&rdquo; feature  </u> </a>  comes as a welcome relief. You&rsquo;ll also be able to see peaks in message volume with the inbox chart, jump to work on messages from a specific week or day, and quickly filter messages by message type or brand keyword as well. We also like the &ldquo;Live activity updates&rdquo; that appear right inside the message stream, which shows if any of our social media collaborators are responding to a particular message in real-time!</p><h3> 3. Save drafts to keep track of your thoughts.</h3><p> Got an idea for a social media post that you just don&rsquo;t have time to flesh out right away? Sprout Social lets you save your thoughts in &ldquo;Draft&rdquo; mode, so you or others can work on it later. With Sprout&rsquo;s shared Team Content Calendar, it&rsquo;s easy to incorporate these drafts into the existing schedule for seamless operation.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-02-at-8.54.58-AM.png\" width=\"611\"/></p><h3> 4. Find the optimal times to connect with your audience.</h3><p> With ViralPost&reg;, you can determine the most effective times to publish new content to your social media networks, based on usage and engagement patterns. You can then advance-schedule posts based on the recommended findings. You can customize postings up to 10 times per day, in fact! We also love the ability to quickly scan which messages are resonating best with our followers using the  <u>  <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/features/social-media-publishing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sent Message Stats function  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 5. See who your top influencers and most engaged followers are.</h3><p> It can be challenging to keep track of so many names and faces and profiles over time. Thankfully, Sprout Social makes it easy by providing a quick rundown of followers who have conversed with or mentioned your brand. You&rsquo;ll get a glimpse of their photo, tagline, and number of followers to determine who your most influential fans might be. Their full profiles are just a click away! And, by the same token, you can also easily &ldquo;Clean Up&rdquo; inactive followers who simply aren&rsquo;t seeing or connecting with your company.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-02-at-8.57.16-AM.png\" width=\"580\"/></p><h3> 6. Manage customer relationships with ease.</h3><p> Click on a person&rsquo;s avatar to see a complete history of interactions. Add notes to help you keep track of off-line interactions with customers or to let collaborators know the best way to reach a particular contact. Check out geographically relevant social media users and suggested contacts based on conversations, mentions and followers. Integrate Sprout Social with Zendesk, Salesforce and UserVoice for a more complete snapshot of your customer relationship management that unites marketing efforts, support help, and sales all in one place.</p><h3> 7. Participate in relevant conversations in real-time.</h3><p> Ideally, marketers want to give the right solution to the right problem at the right time. The &ldquo;Smart Search&rdquo; feature lets you monitor relevant keywords, brand mentions and conversations taking place right now. Smart Search is an easy way to find new people to engage and add to your list of followers. Brick-and-mortars can benefit from the ability to search social media messages originating from a particular zip code nearby and pitch compelling real-time offers as well.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"357\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-02-at-8.51.00-AM.png\" width=\"611\"/></p><h3> 8. Organize and find share-worthy news.</h3><p> Plug your Google Reader into Sprout Social&rsquo;s RSS feature to read and share content from all your feeds right within your dashboard. We find this is a huge time saver because you&rsquo;ll no longer need to visit each individual page to read content or go to another window to share the content you find.</p><h3> Sprout Social Limitations</h3><p> <br/> There are a few limitations to Sprout Social. For one, you can&rsquo;t use it to monitor your Pinterest or Instagram feeds. Also, strangely, your LinkedIn messages do not appear in your inbox stream (although you can still schedule and post to your LinkedIn groups).  <u>  LinkedIn </u>  is also not included in the analytics reports, which is a bit of a disappointment, especially if you&rsquo;re a B2B marketer. The price is another drawback for some marketers, with the cheapest level of service starting at $59/month for Sprout Social (compared to $10/month for HootSuite). If you&rsquo;re on the fence,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/sproutsocial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sprout Social&rsquo;s free 30-day trial  </a> </u>  may sway you.</p><p> <strong>  Want to learn more about Sprout Social? </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/sproutsocial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Check out SproutSocial.com and sign up for a free trial.  </a> </u></p>",

    "content": "<p> The endless industry discussion regarding issues with Advisor Fees shouldn&rsquo;t actually be focused on the fees at all.</p><h3> The fees are not the problem.</h3><p> <br/> The problem is with the communication of the value associated with the fees. Most advisors provide value beyond the assets under management fee structure. But in many cases, the fees are presented only in relationship to assets under management.  <br/> <br/> When fees are presented only as AUM-related, then the only value is the investment process that drives the investments. There are many problems with presenting your fees this way as the industry continues to change with new low cost options infiltrating the investment business. <br/> <br/> The key is to present your value with the precision and confidence that you deliver your value. <br/> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve ever been asked questions like these below, it may be time to rethink the fee discussion: <br/> <br/> <strong>  &lsquo;What am I paying these fees for?&rsquo;  <br/>  &lsquo;How do you compare your services to [XYZ Robo-advisor]?&rsquo; </strong></p><h3> Several firms have begun changing the way they present how they get paid.</h3><p> <br/> We call it a core story. It is not the elevator statement or value proposition, but an in-depth description of what you get paid for. It is your Value Conversation. <br/> <br/> If delivered in a segmented way, your fee/value conversation can be done clearly, concisely, with precision, and can be understood and remembered by the client. Think of presenting your value by segmenting it into 3 distinct categories that each has an associated fee. For instance you could say &ndash; &ldquo;there are 3 things we do&rdquo; and then break up all of the things you do into 3 distinct categories. For instance, one advisor we work with states &hellip; \"There are 3 things that we do: Complete Financial Planning, our Investment Process, and Family Office Services.&rdquo; He discusses each in detail and then associates a sample fee based on the value for each of the three categories. In closing the conversation, he presents one overall, average fee that is less than the 3 individual segments. His clients understand it and he does not have a fee issue. His clients know his value. <br/> <br/> You may not be ready or able to change the model in which you charge fees. But you can change the way you communicate all the value you bring. <strong>  Think about changing the way you discuss what you do so that every client knows you are worth at least what they are paying you. </strong></p>",

So no matter how good our technique, or how nice we are, or how deserving there is a fairly significant proportion of the world who just won&rsquo;t give referrals.  Ever.</p><p> BUT there is a similar proportion who will virtually always give referrals just because you asked (unless you are completely and utterly undeserving).  Assuming that you are like most other professionals in that you are service-orientated, knowledgeable, pleasant, wear decent clothes and don&rsquo;t smell awful, then a good proportion of humanity will give you referrals simply because you asked.</p><p> So why don&rsquo;t advisers roll the dice more often and just make it a point of asking everyone for referrals at the appropriate time anyway?</p><h3> About a quarter to a third of the time you are going to get leads, so why wouldn&rsquo;t you ask?</h3><p> <br/> Even if we don&rsquo;t have an especially clever or polished way of asking there is a fair proportion who will provide favourable introductions anyway, so what do we have to lose?  Those who say &ldquo;no&rdquo; are not rejecting you personally, they are rejecting the notion of referring anyone to anyone at all. It is not personal. Unless you smell awful, then it might be personal.</p><p> The key to not missing out on those opportunities is ensuring that asking, or at least alerting people to the fact that you would like to be referred, is part of your process.  By simply including it in your interview process at some point and then using it every time you will generate some leads&hellip;and every one of them is potential gold.</p><p> Great preparation and skill will help in converting the 35-60% of the population who are maybe&rsquo;s&hellip;.the ones who may or may not give you referrals.  In the next post I&rsquo;ll discuss in detail the preparation and skills which help unlock those opportunities because they do make a massive difference to your level of success with word-of-mouth marketing, however I believe it is more important to ensure that our process includes positioning for and asking for referrals before we worry about great technique or being particularly clever.</p><p> You will never get referrals if you don&rsquo;t ask, so play the odds&hellip;roll the dice&hellip;take your chances: you will win sometimes.  </p><h3> And that is better than never.</h3>",

    "link": "why-work-is-disappearing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Interestingly, the UPS website longitudes.ups.com, last summer, republished an article by University of Oxford's Carl Benedikt Frey called  <u>  <a href=\"http://longitudes.ups.com/future-of-work/?utm_content=buffer79a77&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Future of Work  </a> </u> . Evidently, someone at UPS intuitively understands that the jobs of  <u>  435,000 UPS workers </u>  (worldwide) may be in jeopardy, threatened not only by drone delivery but (more immediately) by developments like  <u>  Shyp </u> , which is analogous to Uber in its ability to put drivers out of work. <br/> <br/> <strong>  To quote from the Frey article:  </strong></p><p> Throughout history, technological progress has created enormous wealth but also caused great disruption. The United States&rsquo; steel industry, for example, underwent a major transformation in the 1960s, when large, integrated steel mills were gradually put out of business by mini mills, destroying the existing economic base of cities like Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Youngstown, Ohio. The mini mills, however, vastly increased productivity, and created new types of work elsewhere.</p><p> The story of US steel illustrates an important lesson about what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415567893/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   creative destruction  </a> </u> : Long-run economic growth involves more than just increasing output in existing factories; it is also implies structural changes in employment.</p><p> We can observe a similar phenomenon in the current information and communications technology (ICT) revolution, which has affected most areas of the modern workplace, even those not directly associated with computer programming or software engineering.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/uks8lyaf20x9vkq/ComputerRevolution_Web.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Computer technologies  </a> </u>  have created prosperous new businesses (even business clusters) while making certain manufacturing workers redundant and sending older manufacturing cities into decline.</p><p> But the likes of Detroit, Lille, or Leeds have not suffered because of falling manufacturing output; on the contrary, output has been growing in these cities over the past decade. Instead, their decline stems directly from their failure to attract different types of jobs. <br/> <br/> To a large extent, this is a failure of policy. Rather than trying to preserve the past by propping up old industries, officials should focus on managing the transition to new forms of work. This requires a better understanding of emerging technologies, and how they differ from those that they are supplanting. <br/> <br/> An important feature of the Industrial Revolution&rsquo;s early manufacturing technologies was that they replaced relatively skilled artisans, which in turn increased demand for unskilled factory workers. Similarly, Henry Ford&rsquo;s assembly line for manufacturing cars &ndash; introduced in 1913 &ndash; was specifically designed for unskilled workers to operate machinery, thereby allowing the company to produce its popular Model T &ndash; the first car that middle-class Americans could afford.</p><p> Already one can feel various dubious assumptions creeping into the discussion. Saying that the \"likes of Detroit\" have suffered from \"failure to attract different kinds of jobs\" implies that Detroit is responsible for keeping its citizens employed; that it is all a matter of \"attracting\" jobs (with what? incentives for the 1%?). We have heard this sort of thing before in the hollow rhetoric of the various ambassadors from Kochistan who constantly tell us localities are not doing enough to favor business, as if we need to be giving more (and more, and more) tax handouts and incentives to business in order to ensure employment; clearly an extortionist proposition (which hasn't worked). By blaming Detroit's problems on \"a failure of policy,\" blame is neatly deflected away from capitalistic players, toward public-sector players (politicians), a queer argument by the 1% for more central planning. <br/> <br/> Frey correctly notes, however, that the Industrial Revolution replaced relatively skilled artisans with unskilled factory workers. In today's world, the same effect is not hard to see, as programming jobs go to India or Romania or Russia (etc.) and U.S. programmers are left to find part-time/benefits-reduced and/or less skilled work at WalMart wherever they can find it. <br/> <br/> Later in his article, Frey says \"And it is not far-fetched to imagine the likes of Google&rsquo;s self-driving cars making bus and taxi drivers redundant one day,\" completely ignoring the fact that Uber has already put 100,000 cab drivers out of work, cut cab requests in San Francisco by 65%, and reduced the value of a NYC medallion by $200,000 in less than a year.</p><h3> Let's be clear.</h3><p> <br/> The new \"job creators\" of this economy are companies like Google and Facebook and Apple, and they are not contributing much in the way of jobs. Apple, for example, outsources almost all of its manufacturing activity to other countries. If we look at a sample of tech companies and the number of people they employ, relative to their size (represented by market capitalization), we get:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-02-at-9.35.50-AM.png\" width=\"247\"/></p><p> The ten companies shown employ a total of 601,717 people but have a market cap of $2.3 trillion. Thus it takes $3.8 million in market cap to create one tech job. Compare this with, say, UPS, which has a market cap of $90.9 billion but employs 435,000 worldwide (according to the  <u>  company's website </u> ), which means it takes $209,000 of market cap to create one UPS \"service sector\" job.  <br/> <br/> From a market-cap point of view, a company like UPS is 19 times better at creating jobs than a tech company. Perhaps more accurately, it could be said that tech companies are 19 times better at \"creating value\" than UPS. But, value for whom?Shareholders? Most employees of these companies are indeed shareholders as well. But there are precious few of them. Tech does not create large numbers of jobs. That's the bottom line.</p><h3> \"But you're comparing apples and lemons,\" someone will say.</h3><p> <br/> \"You can't compare a company like UPS to a tech company, they're entirely different.\" Yes, but the question is whether we want our future to look more like Apple, or more like UPS. Are jobs, in this economy, trending more toward tech-based enterprises, or more toward conventional service jobs? Isn't the influence of tech creeping into even the most UPS-like of companies? And doesn't it have the effect of making companies more efficient, better able to produce \"value\" with fewer employees? That's the point. The main effect of technology is to reduce employment. <br/> <br/> The typical comeback is to say that historically, people who have been displaced by technology always seem to find work in other jobs, new types of jobs. Which has been true, historically. But what if the \"new types of jobs\" are all in technology? Then we're screwed. Because there aren't enough of those jobs to go around (see table above). And we ship them overseas regularly. <br/> <br/> This is a fundamentally different era than the Henry Ford era (when Americans moved off of farms, into factories and urban centers), with an employment problem that cannot be solved with \"better policy\" aimed at more handouts to the \"job creators.\" The \"job creators\" are doing better than ever, thank you (without creating an excess of new jobs). It's the rest of us, frankly, who need a break now. <br/> <br/> For more on this subject, see  <u>  <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2015/04/this-is-what-plutocracy-looks-like.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   This Is What Plutocracy Looks Like  </a> </u>  (at this blog) and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/06/future-create-jobs-bottom-up_n_6781114.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Future Of Work: Three Ways We Can Create Jobs From The Bottom Up  </a> </u>  (HuffPo).

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Research shows that the climate of an organization influences an individual&rsquo;s contribution far more than the individual himself.&rdquo; &mdash;W. Edwards Deming </strong></p><h3> How Leadership Impacts Culture</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Culture is a set of values, behaviors, and habits that operate within the organization even when no one is looking. </strong> The culture of an organization is driven by what leaders value, how they behave, and what they communicate. Leadership ripples through the organization with either productive or devastating power. It can build or break down barriers; widen or bridge gaps. It can build others and inspire greatness or it can tear others down and cause them to disengage. Leadership either encourages collaboration and challenging the status quo or stifles teamwork and innovation.</p><p> Culture and inspiration grow from the vision, long-standing values, and behaviors of the leader. If the leader is seen as being selfless and authentic then followers are more likely to buy into their vision for the future. This type of leader inspires a trusting and consistent culture.</p><p> <strong>  As a leader, employees watch how you behave to determine if you are authentic and deserving of support. </strong> You are always under observation; employees are taking their social and cultural cues from you. Are you transparent? Are you willing to share pertinent information about the organization including financial metrics and profit, operating plans, priorities, and the current focus? Are you supportive and encouraging? When you are transparent and share information employees feel secure, they feel like they are an important part of a team, and they want to be part of your vision. Your leadership has a direct and deep-seated impact on the culture of your organization.</p><h3> Why it Matters</h3><p> <br/> The top challenges facing organizations today are culture, engagement, and employee retention. Culture matters because it is the very fiber of the organization and determines how goals will be accomplished. The culture you create serves as the vehicle with which you get people working together towards accomplishing a shared vision. A dysfunctional culture hurts your bottom line; it results in decreased productivity and quality, increased employee absences, and higher turnover. The culture of your organization determines how employees feel about their work and themselves; when they feel good they invest 100% of themselves in their performance.</p><p> <strong>  Your culture ultimately translates into your brand. </strong> What do you want your brand message to be? If you, as the leader, do not serve something greater than yourself, your employees will not follow. They may perform their tasks, but when their hearts are not in it productivity and engagement suffer. When productivity and engagement suffer, how your organization is perceived by clients, suppliers, and the community suffers. Your leadership isn&rsquo;t about you; it&rsquo;s about recognizing and bringing out the best in others while uniting teams under a common vision for the future. Are your employees engaged? The level of employee engagement is a good indication of the health of the culture in your organization.</p><p> Set your ego aside and take an honest assessment of your culture and the impact your behavior, as a leader, is having. Your culture will mimic the same tone, mission, and values as your leadership. You can&rsquo;t fool yourself any longer; culture matters. Your culture tells everyone why your organization exists, where it is going, and how it will get there. Look around, you can see the culture in what your employees are saying about you and in the levels of positive energy or negative energy in your organization.</p><h3> Take-Away</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  No one can know or do everything themselves, we all need the cooperation of others to succeed. </strong> Your leadership can transform the culture into one that is supportive and engaging or it can tear down the very fabric of cooperation and dedication. Are your employees engaged and excited to be part of your vision? What you value, how you behave, and what you communicate, as a leader, will create the culture of your organization. And, culture matters.</p>",

    "link": "property-and-casualty-insurance-what-does-it-all-mean",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Most of us understand the importance of insurance to protect us financially. But many of us pay for insurance every year without understanding exactly what we are protected for &mdash; and what&rsquo;s not covered.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the common policies most of us need, including homeowner&rsquo;s insurance, renter&rsquo;s insurance, auto insurance, valuables insurance, and umbrella insurance.</p><h3> Homeowner&rsquo;s Insurance</h3><p> <br/> Homeowners need comprehensive homeowner&rsquo;s insurance. This adds liability insurance to the standard hazard policy to cover any injuries to people on your property. It also covers injuries caused by household members (including pets). Your homeowner&rsquo;s insurance would kick in, for example, if your dog accidentally injures a child on your property.</p><p> Homeowner&rsquo;s insurance covers many possible damages, including wind damage, fire damage, theft, and more. But many potential disasters aren&rsquo;t covered. The most common exclusions are for flood and earthquake damage. Look at the &ldquo;exclusions&rdquo; category of your homeowner&rsquo;s insurance to see what isn&rsquo;t covered with your existing policy. If you&rsquo;re at risk for these scenarios, additional insurance policies are available (and may even be required from lenders if you&rsquo;re  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/saving-down-payment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   taking out a mortgage  </a> </u>  to buy a property).</p><p> Make sure to read the fine print as to what the insurance company will provide in the case of the destruction of your home. Many policies will cover replacement cost up to an initial estimate, but some policies will provide guaranteed replacement coverage, which covers the complete repair or rebuilding costs.</p><p> Also consider a high deductible if you have the  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-budget-and-manage-your-finances-on-a-variable-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cash flow  </a> </u>  to handle paying the initial costs should anything happen. And remember that if you claim small losses on your homeowner&rsquo;s insurance, your rate will rise and your policy could be canceled in some circumstances.</p><h3> Renter&rsquo;s Insurance</h3><p> <br/> If you rent, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you have renter&rsquo;s insurance. A renter&rsquo;s insurance policy protects against the loss or destruction of your possessions when renting a house or an apartment. (The landlord&rsquo;s insurance will cover the building, but it doesn&rsquo;t usually include any provisions for the renting occupants.)</p><p> Similar to homeowner&rsquo;s insurance, renter&rsquo;s insurance also provides personal liability coverage to those renting the home as well as guests visiting the home. Since the policy doesn&rsquo;t protect the building itself, renter&rsquo;s insurance is often very affordable. Many landlords will require renter&rsquo;s insurance as a condition before accepting a lease.</p><h3> Car Insurance</h3><p> <br/> In most states, drivers need auto insurance with liability coverage in order to obtain a license. Liability coverage covers the injury and property claims of another party when you&rsquo;re at fault in an accident. You can also have collision insurance, which covers your repairs costs if you are at fault in an accident.</p><p> Comprehensive coverage will cover damage on the car from multiple sources, not just automobile accidents. This includes damage due to fire, storms, theft, and vandalism. Some states also require personal injury protection. This will pay for your own medical expenses in the case of an automobile accident, regardless of who was at fault.</p><p> You will likely also want uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for better protection in case of an accident. This will cover your damages in the case of a hit-and-run or uninsured driver. For just a bit more, you can also pay to cover for drivers that are underinsured. This would kick in if the driver injures you or damages your property, but does not have adequate coverage for the full amount.</p><h3> Valuables Insurance</h3><p> <br/> If you have homeowner&rsquo;s insurance or renter&rsquo;s insurance, you have some protection for precious valuables like jewelry, art, or collectibles. However, the liability limits are often low as these items can be stolen easily.</p><p> If you have special valuables that would be difficult to replace (think art work, engagement rings, inherited jewelry, etc), look into covering these items by raising the limit on your policy or by purchasing a separate valuables rider for each item.</p><p> Insuring each piece might cost more in premiums, but you&rsquo;ll also be offered more protection.</p><h3> Umbrella Insurance</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve discussed protecting your home, your car, and your valuables. But there&rsquo;s something that many of us  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/disability-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   don&rsquo;t think to protect with insurance  </a> </u>  &ndash; and that&rsquo;s your net worth.</p><p> Even though homeowner&rsquo;s insurance and auto insurance does cover some amount of liability coverage, a bad car accident quickly could exceed your liability limit in your vehicle insurance. Your savings, home, and future earnings could be at risk. Umbrella insurance steps in to cover the difference in all your policies to protect your net worth.</p><p> It will cover property damage, bodily injury claims, and legal costs. Typically, policies will start at $1 million in coverage for around $200 a year. If you can&rsquo;t afford to rebuild your  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-much-do-i-need-to-invest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   nest egg  </u>  , </a>  you want to protect it with umbrella insurance.</p><h3> Sleep Easy At Night</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve covered many types of property and casualty insurance, from homeowner&rsquo;s insurance to umbrella insurance. With this overview in hand, talk with your insurance agent or broker about which coverage is right for your situation. This way you can look into your policies with confidence to make sure you, your possessions, and your assets are properly protected.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Every so often I get involved with a project that&rsquo;s just plain fun.</h3><p> <br/> Today is one of those days. I&rsquo;ll be working with some creative partners on a new financial services video. It&rsquo;s fun because I get to work with some amazingly talented people but what really rocks is the fact that the video will be good for my client&rsquo;s business.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t made video a part of your sales, marketing and communications efforts yet, you really ought to. It&rsquo;s easer than you think, and the results can be dramatic. You just have to get started. Still not sure that video is important for your business? take a look at  <u>  <a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   these striking statistics  </a> </u>  published by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ramp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ramp.com  </a> </u> . Here are just a few&hellip;</p><li> In November 2014, 192 million Americans watched online content videos via desktop computer. ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Releases-November-2014-US-Desktop-Online-Video-Rankings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source  </a> </u> ) </li><li> Younger adults 18-34 (39%) and males (25%) report watching more online video content each month. ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iab.net/media/file/GfKIAB2014OriginalDigitalVideoReport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source  </a> </u> )</li><li> 51% of people learn about original online videos through word-of-mouth. ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iab.net/media/file/GfKIAB2014OriginalDigitalVideoReport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source  </a> </u> ) </li><li> Roughly 6 in 10 US adults say they watch videos when they visit a brand website with video content, and 4 in 10 prefer watching a brand video over reading the same information. ( <a href=\"http://www.levelsbeyond.com/consumersdemandbrandvideo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Source </a> )  <br/>  </li><p> If these online user statistics aren&rsquo;t convincing enough, ask yourself, your friends or your colleagues if they watch videos online. Most people will tell you they do.</p><p> Video can be used to engage first time visitors to your site, or as elements of your strategic marketing and communications strategy. The  <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RFnvuIkmboY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   video on my website  </a> </u> , for example, is more likely to be viewed by someone who has already taken an interest in working with me, and wants to know me and my services better.</p><p> People who have watched my videos tell me they give them a good feeling about me; a sense of confidence in my expertise and style. I&rsquo;ll take that kind of positive impression every time! </p><h3> So, how do you do it?</h3><p> <br/> How do you get from &ldquo;yes, video is a good idea! I want to use it to attract interest and help grow my business&rdquo; to actually being there?</p><p> The short answer is hire professionals. I worked with the great folks at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gravitymediaproductions.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gravity Media Productions  </a> </u>  to produce my videos, and I&rsquo;m delighted with the high quality of the product. I wrote the script (more on that next week), and Tyson and Kagan at Gravity did the camera and sound, makeup, lights, editing, graphics and music bed. They then set up my YouTube channel and uploaded the videos for linking to my website. I also send links in my social media updates now and then.</p><p> Of course any time you engage professionals, especially really good professionals, you should expect to pay more than if you tried to do it yourself. And generally speaking if your video will be used prominently, you want high production values that only professionals can make possible.</p><p> On the other hand, if you have the time, it&rsquo;s possible for you or someone on your team to create video. There are a lot of great resources online for how to use your own high res digital camera, lights and sound gear to create great looking videos. Take a look at this  <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/q2wIUZPe_OI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   instructional video  </a> </u>  from Media Unlocked. This in one of hundreds of resources that will walk you through the process of equipping a &ldquo;studio&rdquo; and making high quality, great looking, great sounding videos.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not always necessary to have high production values. In some instances, self-shot videos can be a perfect addition to a company&rsquo;s existing high-quality video. This is especially true when you want to convey a sense of immediacy and spontaneity. One example might be a daily market update, where audiences appreciate the relevance of the content more than the quality of the production.</p><p> Do-it-yourself video is almost ridiculously simple, as you can see by watching  <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qczwWqpRLbc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this video  </a> </u>  from Australian blogger and videographer Angry Chair. He&rsquo;s using his iPhone with an inexpensive microphone to make a video that I think you&rsquo;ll find amazingly good &ndash; and he&rsquo;s doing it while he&rsquo;s driving!</p><h3> Another great way to create video is to use animation and motion graphics.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m sure you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. You know, those instructional videos and commercials where you&rsquo;re not watching live action, but animated words and figures accompanying the voiceover.</p><p> Again, you can hire a professional motion graphics designer and a sound engineer to record your voiceover for top quality results, but you can also create your own using great online tools such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.videoscribe.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   VideoScribe  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"https://standout.adobe.com/voice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Adobe Voice  </a> </u> , a free app offered for the iPad only. Take a look at these. You&rsquo;ll be impressed</p><p> Just in case you&rsquo;re still not sure that video makes sense for you and your business, here are some  <u>  more statistics </u>  from  <u>  Digital Sherpa </u> , with even more compelling reasons why video has to be a part of your marketing and communications mix. They even offer a small business video marketing guide.</p><p> Finally for today, you&rsquo;ll need to know how to set up your very own YouTube (or other video hosting service) channel where your videos will live, improving your search engine performance and giving you helpful analytics to measure the effectiveness of your videos. YouTube, which is part of Google, makes it easy. Start by taking a look at these  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBOh8f9FoHHisZ9zCKMTcc6RDbIWdrsOa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   YouTube tutorials  </a> </u> .</p><p> Now you know the how, which is really important but not nearly as important as the What and Why &ndash; Your message and objective. In other words, the story you want to tell. Next week, I&rsquo;ll share some tips and best practices for developing video scripts that grab your audience&rsquo;s attention.</p><p> How does your company use video? If for sales and marketing, how do you measure its effectiveness? Can you think of an industry or business whose prospective customers would not be interested in a video representation of the company and the value it delivers?</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> THERE are unseen but powerful laws that determine the success or failure of client relationships. Just as an airplane must respect the laws of physics in order to fly, your strategies and behaviors must align with the Relationship Laws if you want to sell effectively and build your clients for life.</p><p> When you follow these Relationship Laws, your network will grow rapidly. Prospects will become eager buyers. You&rsquo;ll be seen by clients as a trusted partner rather than an expense to be managed. And you&rsquo;ll find the people around you eager to help you succeed. When you ignore the laws, however, it&rsquo;s like pushing water uphill. Relationship building will seem like very hard work&mdash;even fruitless.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at six of the Relationship Laws that, if properly leveraged, can help you dramatically improve your effectiveness with prospects and clients.</p><h3> The Forgotten Ingredient in Sales</h3><p> <br/> A senior account executive I know was once walking out of a meeting with his client, the CEO. The CEO&rsquo;s executive assistant stopped him and pulled him aside. In a low voice, she told him, &ldquo;My boss has confessed to me that he views those PowerPoint slides as the &lsquo;price&rsquo; he has to pay to have a good conversation with you.&rdquo;  Her revelation underscored the fact that we focus too much on presenting, pitching, cajoling, and impressing. We sometimes bludgeon our clients with analysis and reams of paper.</p><p> What most senior executives actually want is to have a vibrant discussion that helps to improve their understanding of the problem at hand and the possible solutions. Law One addresses this underlying need: Power relationships are based on great conversations, not one person showing the other how much they know. To use this law to your advantage, you have to stop defining your client interaction as a sales call, a credentials presentation, or an operational update on progress. Instead, reframe every meeting by asking the question, &ldquo;How can I create a great conversation?&rdquo;</p><p> How would you rate the quality of your client conversations right now? For example, do your conversations help your prospects:</p><li> Improve their understanding of their challenges?</li><li> Learn about the impact of important trends on their business?</li><li> Better understand how they can capture growth opportunities?</li><li> Become energized and enthusiastic about working with you and your firm?</li><li> Reach towards you and want to know more? <br/>  </li><p> Follow the First Law and restrain your urge to impress others. Improve your conversations and you&rsquo;ll dramatically strengthen your relationships.</p><h3> The Best Way to Meet CEOs</h3><p> <br/> A client of mine was promoted to a very senior position in a large, Fortune-100 company. She had been the deputy in her area, and was now at the top. She told me that the day her promotion was announced in the newspapers, she got dozens of calls from suppliers wanting to do business with her. &ldquo;Do you know what I said to each of them?&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I asked them, &lsquo;Where were you five years ago?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> Many professionals ask me, &ldquo;How can I build more relationships with CEOs and other top executives?&rdquo; The best answer is the Third Law of Relationships: Follow the person, not the position. Build relationships with smart, motivated, interesting, and ambitious people, even if they&rsquo;re not in an important job right now. Follow them throughout their careers.</p><p> Truly important people&mdash;those who are the top of their careers in any field&mdash;have often brought their advisors and trusted suppliers along with them over many years. While it is not impossible to break into someone&rsquo;s inner circle after they have achieved great success, it&rsquo;s also not an easy task.</p><p> Use Law Three and your job will become much easier. Start by making a list of people you know who are not yet at the peak of their success or position. Pick passionate, motivated, talented individuals. Do you know what their agenda is? How can you help them accomplish their goals? Stay in touch as they progress from job to job.</p><h3> The Power of Reach</h3><p> <br/> How do you grab a prospect&rsquo;s attention? It&rsquo;s simple: You evoke their curiosity&mdash;their desire to know more. But it has to be substantive, not manipulated, curiosity.</p><p> I once found myself halfway around the world, with only five minutes to convince a skeptical CEO that his company should hire me. At that moment, Law Eighteen became my best friend. It&rsquo;s very simple but powerful: Make them curious. With only five minutes to spare, I had to throw the traditional sales process out the window (i.e., &ldquo;ask good questions&rdquo;, &ldquo;establish your credibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;understand their pain points&rdquo;) and instead create a strong desire on the part of the CEO to engage with me&mdash;to know more.</p><p> When someone is curious, they reach towards you. They&rsquo;re eager to take the next step. When you evoke curiosity you create a gravitational pull that is irresistible. Curiosity helps you get more of everything: More inquiries, more sales, more success at getting meetings with your senior clients. And yes, it works in your personal life as well. If you&rsquo;re good at evoking curiosity, it can get you more dates if you are single and more RSVPs for your party!</p><p> You create curiosity and reach by showing just a bit of the glitter of the gold you have to offer your client. Say the unexpected. Surprise the other person with your candid answer to a tough question. Shake their thinking up by showing them a side to their problem they had not considered.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll draw others in when you tell them what they need to know, not everythingyou know. Give brief answers to questions. Hint at things. Don&rsquo;t lecture a prospect for ten minutes when they ask you to describe your firm. Develop contrarian or unusual perspectives. Be seen as someone who has refreshing points of view.</p><p> Also, ask the provocative questions that no one else is asking. When everyone is telling your client how to do something, you should be asking why they want to do it.</p><p> Above all, make them curious. With my CEO prospect, I took the first two minutes to mention several important risks his people had not considered, and one opportunity I felt they were missing. It made the CEO suddenly sit up in his chair. The meeting stretched to 15 minutes, and I got the sale.</p><h3> How to Make It So</h3><p> <br/> A client of mine in the energy supply business had been shut out of a major account for years. They sell what many describe as a &ldquo;commodity&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a uniform product you can get from many suppliers at an established market price.</p><p> My client was told there was absolutely no way they were going to get a piece of this account&rsquo;s business&mdash;that the company was already well served. They refused to accept this, and continued to call on them. During that time they brought them a series of suggestions for how to more effectively use my client&rsquo;s product and increase their productivity. They shared proprietary market information. They learned about the key priorities of the executives they were calling on, and helped each of them out in small ways.</p><p> After one year, the senior executive at the account told them, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to give you an order. We hadn&rsquo;t planned on this. But for over a year you&rsquo;ve treated us like a client even though you haven&rsquo;t made a cent from the relationship. You&rsquo;re giving us better service than some of our existing suppliers. You&rsquo;ve earned this.&rdquo; They subsequently became one of my client&rsquo;s largest relationships.</p><p> This story illustrates a powerful relationship-building strategy: act like the future relationship you desire is already in place. Give a high-potential prospect the same care and love you&rsquo;d lavish on an existing client.</p><p> <strong>  In Power Relationships we call it Relationship Law Fifteen: Treat a prospect like a client, and there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll become one. </strong></p><p> By the way, do you desire to have a great relationship with a friend or family member? Use this Law. Pretend you already have the loving relationship you aspire to. You&rsquo;ll be generous, kind, and patient, and you&rsquo;ll bring the other person along.</p><h3> The Power of Power Questions</h3><p> <br/> The 1988 winner of the Nobel prize for literature, Naguib Mafouz, put it this way: &ldquo;You can tell if a man is clever by his answers, you can tell if a man is wise by his questions.&rdquo; Answers are important. But if you want to create the great conversations that build power relationships, you need to become skilled at asking thought-provoking questions.</p><p> Consider asking questions that:</p><li> Access emotions, not just analytical thought (&ldquo;What are you doing in your business that you&rsquo;re most excited about right now?&rdquo; Versus &ldquo;What are your top three priorities?&rdquo;)</li><li> Draw out others&rsquo; views (What do you think?)</li><li> Engage the other person in the solution (What options are you considering? What do you think is the best decision for you?)</li><li> Focus the conversation on the right issues (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the most important thing we should discuss this morning?&rdquo; &ldquo;What would be the most valuable use of our time?&rdquo;)</li><li> Uncover the other person&rsquo;s agenda of key priorities (&ldquo;What are the most important things you&rsquo;ll be evaluated on this year?&rdquo;)</li><li> Access the other person&rsquo;s highest-level goals and aspirations (&ldquo;Why do you want to do that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is the business goal that&rsquo;s driving that?&rdquo;)</li><li> Challenge (&ldquo;Do you think 10% is enough? We&rsquo;ve had other customers who achieved over 20&hellip;&rdquo;)</li><li> Help establish your own credibility (&ldquo;Many of my clients are grappling with two big issues right now&hellip; What&rsquo;s your reaction been?&rdquo;)</li><li> Explore who the other person is and how they became who they are (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious, how did you get your start?&rdquo;) <br/>  </li><h3> Are You Profit or Expense to Your Clients?</h3><p> <br/> Think about this: If your plumber calls you up and suggests you have lunch to discuss the latest joint-soldering techniques, you probably would decline. And, as much as you like him, if another reputable plumber offered to do a major job for significantly less, you might very well be swayed to accept.</p><p> But what if your doctor called? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got your test results back, and you ought to come by so we can discuss them. I have some important suggestions for you about your diet and lifestyle.&rdquo; I think your response would be, &ldquo;How soon can you see me?&rdquo;</p><p> Relationship Law Twenty-Two frames this in terms of your work with clients:Become part of your clients&rsquo; growth and profits and they&rsquo;ll never get enough of you. The flip side of this Law is that if clients view you as an expense to be managed, they&rsquo;ll cut you at any time.</p><p> When there&rsquo;s a downturn, or when clients are under financial pressures, they focus on cutting discretionary expenses. But they won&rsquo;t cut an investment that&rsquo;s proven to help grow revenues or increase profits. And you should be such an investment.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re working with clients, you have to clearly show how your work is supporting their growth and profits. A client can replace a commodity &ldquo;expert for hire&rdquo; at any time&mdash;perhaps with a cheaper expert. But a provider who is seen as supporting a client&rsquo;s most essential programs is not easily replaceable. Their cost is framed against a much larger set of benefits.</p><p> This Law doesn&rsquo;t just apply to client relationships. For example, if your boss views you as directly helping her achieve her most important priorities for the year, then you&rsquo;ll be considered indispensable.</p><p> To be seen as part of growth and profits, you have to show how your products and services are helping your client achieve his or her highest-level goals. A good starting point is a very simple question: How are you going to be evaluated at the end of the year? Then, you can ask a second, related question: How do your individual goals support the organization&rsquo;s overall strategy and key priorities for this year?</p><p> Harness these Relationship Laws. Align yourself with them and you&rsquo;ll find that selling and relationship building is dramatically easier. It&rsquo;s the difference between trying to push water uphill and letting it flow naturally downhill according to the laws of gravity.</p><p> What laws or principles have guided your relationship-building?</p>",

    "content": "<p> So many websites focus on just having one or two good pieces on a topic. It not only makes them look good, it gives their  <u>  audience </u>  confidence in their abilities in this area. Or does it?</p><h3> Can I learn a lot from your site?</h3><p> <br/> Only having a few pieces of  <u>  content </u>  on a subject may look clean, but it doesn&rsquo;t give your readers enough depth. Depth and specificity is what most blogs are lacking.</p><p> Sure it&rsquo;s great to give a list post on obesity, but what does your health care service do differently? What types of specific treatment does your company offer, and why are your products the best for this particular pain point?</p><p> The more you reveal of yourself, the more your customers will avail themselves to you, you&rsquo;ve built trust. Diving deep into the subjects your clients really care about is the best and smartest thing that your company can do. Don&rsquo;t over think hitting publish.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a reason  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenKing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stephen King  </a> </u>  is heralded as one of the  <u>  best authors in American history </u> . It&rsquo;s not because he wrote a best-selling novel. It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s written several best-selling novels. He churns out books like a printing press and consistently delivers content that his readers crave. When Stephen King hits publish, a million people jump in line and buy his books &mdash; every time.</p><p> So how do you get the same type of momentum for your business?</p><h3> Hit publish</h3><p> <br/> Publish more often. Go deeper with your content. Do something &mdash;  <u>  write </u>  something &mdash; that is surprising, and catches your readers off-guard. Throw in an emotional piece about an unsung hero or person in need from your local community, and send it out to your audience. Offer to help the family or set up a channel for donations. Part of being more prolific is being more involved.</p><p> Do interviews with other experts in your field and put them on a YouTube channel. This is going to make you stand out and it adds massive value to your fans.</p><h3> Make it memorable</h3><p> <br/> One of the single most important factors in making content that sticks is being memorable. Writing generic posts won&rsquo;t get you there. Making something meaningful by spotlighting customer questions, offering unique value, or just writing with a style that is as elegant as it is engaging.</p><h3> Do what the pros do: a daily journal</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re really struggling to provide quality content, it may be time to begin a daily writing journal where you write first thing when you wake up in the morning.</p><p> A few hundred words head start towards your content creation can really help you to bring out the Creative Muse.</p><p> Journaling and even using an app such as  <a href=\"http://www.evernote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Evernote  </u>    </a> heavily promoted by bloggers such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/evernote-tags.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Hyatt  </a> </u>  for note taking can dramatically enhance the frequency of your ideas, and ultimately lead to churning out more great content on a weekly basis.</p><h3> Get your content machine going</h3><p> <br/> If you need help in creating some amazing content, please check out our  <u>  copywriting packages </u> .

    "title": "The Difficult Relationship Between Teenagers & Sleep",
    "link": "the-difficult-relationship-between-teenagers-sleep",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you have teenage children, you will notice that their sleeping habits are perhaps quite different from your own. But how much of this is by choice and how much is it due to biology?</p><h3> Teenagers are known for sleeping a lot. Do they actually sleep more than adults or is this a bit of a stereotype?</h3><p> <br/> As I go into detail in my book  <u>  <a href=\"/category/grow/human-performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sleep Soundly Every Night , Feel Fantastic Every Day  </a> </u> , teenagers have significant changes in their circadian rhythms. They require more sleep than adults. In most studies, they seem to do best with nine to ten hours of sleep. Most adults require seven to nine hours of sleep.</p><h3> Is there an optimal length of time a teenager should sleep each night?</h3><p> <br/> Yes, as referenced above. Stanford University conducted  <u>  <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2011/07/snooze-you-win-its-true-for-achieving-hoop-dreams-says-study.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a study on sleep and student athletes  </a> </u> . They found that the closer to ten hours the student athlete slept, the more their athletic performance improved.</p><h3> What changes will we notice as they transition from children to teenagers?</h3><p> <br/> We call it a phase shift. Many teenagers undergo a shift in their circadian rhythms. They find that they need to stay up later to feel sleepy. Their normal bedtime may shift as much as three hours or more. This is then compounded by their staying up later and waking up later on weekends, further disrupting their circadian rhythms and making it even more difficult to go to bed earlier and wake up on school days.</p><h3> Why is it then that teenagers sleep more than adults and children? What benefit does it have?</h3><p> <br/> They do not sleep as much as children. School age children need ten to eleven hours of sleep. As for why children and adolescents need more sleep than adults, in part it is related to neural development, a great deal of which occurs throughout sleep. It is also related to growth. We produce the majority of our growth hormone while asleep, especially in deep sleep (slow wave), which occurs during the first few hours of sleep.</p><h3> How long does the teenage phase of sleep last?</h3><p> <br/> In the majority of teenagers, the delay in circadian rhythms is over during their early twenties. However, about 7% will continue to manifest this problem as adults. Many of them will find the night shift to their liking.</p><h3> Does sleep differ for teenage boys and girls?</h3><p> <br/> No, boys and girls seem to need the same amount of sleep. However, insomnia seems to be more common in girls. This may be due to the fact that teenage girls seem to experience more interpersonal stressors with regards to their relationships than boys do.</p><h3> Are there any sleep disorders that may affect teenagers more than children or adults?</h3><p> <br/> Yes, Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. This is a common circadian disorder seen in teenagers more than any other group. It is due to the above-mentioned shift in their circadian clocks. Basically, it is a form of social jet lag. If allowed to go to sleep and wake up later, they do fine. However, because of early school start times they go through the day sleep deprived.</p><h3> What are the consequences of teenagers not getting enough sleep?</h3><p> <br/> There are several consequences. The first is a definite increase in car accidents. Another is an increased incidence of athletic injuries. Insufficient sleep is also a major cause of cognitive problems such as paying attention in school and impulse control. Finally there is a higher incidence of depression, anxiety and suicide in sleep deprived teenagers.</p><h3> So should we cut teenagers a bit of slack when we struggle to prise them out of bed?</h3><p> <br/> Yes, but it goes deeper than that. We need to convince our local schools to institute later start times, especially for teenagers. In the USA, several studies have demonstrated an improvement in academic performance and a decrease in motor vehicle accidents in school districts that have adopted this policy.</p><p> It&rsquo;s clear that the differences in teenager&rsquo;s sleep to that of adults and children could lead to misunderstandings, but the stereotypical &lsquo;lazy teens&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t necessarily lagging behind on purpose.</p><p> Get Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s Latest Book, Sleep Soundly Every Night, Feel Fantastic Every Day: A Doctor's Guide to Solving Your Sleep Problems,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Soundly-Every-Night-Fantastic/dp/1936303728/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396990880&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sleep+soundly+every+night\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Honestly how many of you pay attention to lapels?  Sadly, this extra piece of fabric that extends from the coat collar and finely folds back onto the chest is often an overlooked detail.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve asked a client &lsquo;what type of lapel would you like on your suit jacket?&rsquo; and the response is a blank stare, followed up with &lsquo;what&rsquo;s a lapel?&rsquo;  Truth is most men aren&rsquo;t aware and/or don&rsquo;t know what options are available.  When it comes to lapel styles it really folds down to three choices: Notch, Peak, and Shawl.      </p><h3> What is Notch?</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-04-at-11.12.26-AM.png\" width=\"457\"/></p><p> The notch lapel is the most commonly recognized of all three lapels.  Sewn at an angel, the top of the lapel meets the collar making a V shape (or what I think looks like Pac man&rsquo;s mouth).  If you are to purchase one suit this lifetime, I suggest a notch lapel for a timeless, classic look.</p><h3> What is Peak?</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-04-at-11.12.31-AM.png\" width=\"287\"/></p><p> With corner edges pointing upwards, the peak lapel says I&rsquo;m anything but traditional.  While the notch lapel is sipping scotch in his leather armchair, the peak lapel is tossing back shots of fireball before hitting the town.  Gone are the days when this lapel style was defined as formal.  The peak lapel has evolved past tailcoats and double-breasted jackets; nowadays it&rsquo;s helping the single-breasted coat reach new heights.</p><h3> What is Shawl?</h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-04-at-11.12.33-AM.png\" width=\"372\"/></p><p> Known as the most formal, the shawl lapel shows off its curve with a rounded edge.  Trimming dinner jackets to appear at the finest black tie soir&eacute;e or dressing up tuxedos to attend a wedding, this well-mannered lapel will have you looking &lsquo;fancy&rsquo; your next special event.</p><h3> Keep it Real&hellip;Proportioned</h3><p> Almost any body type can wear these different styles.  No matter what lapel you choose, make sure you keep things proportioned.  I&rsquo;ll leave you with these tips:</p><li> Slim lapels look best on slim fit suits and slimmer frames, in other words slim on slim on slim</li><li> A peak lapel will show off your V-shape torso and accentuate your shoulders</li><li> Rounded faces or rounded bodies should avoid wearing a shawl lapel &ndash; two rounds don&rsquo;t make a right  </li>",

    "title": "7 Things Not to Do with Your Marketing Budget",
    "link": "7-things-not-to-do-with-your-marketing-budget",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a small business owner, spending money on marketing is risky. With all the different types of marketing and technologies out there trying to sell you on the best and fastest ways to grow your business . . .  it can get really overwhelming really quickly over which type of marketing solutions are right for you and your small business.  Yet, you recognize the benefits of a well-executed marketing, as well as the expensive consequences of poor marketing choices. Being a small business myself, there are just certain marketing investments that wind up costing far more than the carrot dangled in front of us.</p><p> There are plenty of great, effective ways to spend your hard-earned marketing dollars (which I&rsquo;ll share next week), but let me share the seven things you may want to table or avoid as a small business.</p><h3> 1. Print Advertising</h3><p> Print advertising is expensive and there is no way to track the ROI of a quarter page ad in a business journal or trade magazine that can cost you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. Don&rsquo;t be lured by fancy demographic sheets that promise to get your brand in front of your ideal customer. In order for print advertising to be most effective, ads run weekly, if not daily, in combination with a digital advertising campaign. Big brands benefit from such campaigns, but they have the big budgets and big talent that go along with successful advertising campaigns.  At most, small businesses selling products or services in a local community might consider including coupons in monthly mailers in lieu of taking out costly ads.</p><h3> 2. Sponsorships</h3><p> I&rsquo;m not saying not to support other businesses or good causes you believe in, but don&rsquo;t focus on sponsorship contributions as a primary marketing tactic as a small business. The marketing value in your sponsorship is the story that comes with it and inviting your audience on that journey with you. Instead, consider donating your time to a worthy cause and capturing your and your team&rsquo;s contributions with valuable pieces of content like video or a blog posts. Doing good does matter and businesses have a tremendous opportunity to make a difference and raise awareness for causes, it just doesn&rsquo;t need to cost you a fortune. Rather than taking out a half page sponsorship ad or sponsoring a hole on a golf course, volunteer your time or run a crowdsourcing campaign that helps get your customers excited and involved in making a difference, too. You don&rsquo;t need to spend a lot of money to support others and see a marketing benefit.</p><h3> 3. Pay-Per-Click Ads</h3><p> Pay-per-click ads can certainly help you and your small business drive my traffic to your site, but so will optimizing your website and content with the keywords you most want to be found for. With a little patience, you can earn your ranking rather than paying for a sponsored position, which is a great alternative for small businesses who don&rsquo;t have huge funds to spend or for businesses who would rather rank for certain keywords because of their online authority on the subject. Personally, I always skip the sponsored links on Google searches, because I want the &lsquo;real&rsquo; result over the &lsquo;paid for&rsquo; one. Check out this great article by Forbes contributor John Rampton for more details why it might not be the best choice for your business  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2014/07/07/5-reasons-you-shouldnt-use-adwords/\" target=\"_blank\">  5 Reasons You Shouldn&rsquo;t Use AdWords </a></p><h3> 4. SEO </h3><p> Let me be very clear: YOU NEED SEO. Hands down, it is a requirement. However, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) goes beyond the invisible backend of your website. High-quality content is a true driver of website traffic and building links. Google continues to place high importance on keywords found on a page of content, not only in the infrasturcture of where that piece of content lives. Choose professionals that make SEO part of their standard, not an above and beyond service. With so many great firms and freelancers making SEO a high priority, there should be no need for your small business to have to pay a premium. This is a great article on SEO:  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/thesba/2014/10/30/seo-basics-for-small-business-owners/\" target=\"_blank\">  SEO Basics for Small Business </a></p><h3> 5. Buying Followers</h3><p> Yes, the quantity of followers you have does make an impression. That being said, it will serve you and your small business far better in the long-run if you earn real followers who are attracted to you and your business. What is the point of having 10,000 Twitter followers if they are dummy accounts that will sit idle on your follower list and never engage with you or your content? And worse, what kind of impression do you give when a real follower looks at your list of followers and sees a bunch of dummy accounts? It sends the wrong message and it would be a far greater use of your dollars to spend money on ways to improve your social media marketing strategy and the content you will publish across social channels. Take the time now to earn a following and the ROI will be worth the wait.</p><h3> 6. Buying Marketing Lists</h3><p> Marketing lists are very alluring for small businesses who want to increase their lead database instantly. The problem with marketing lists is that you don&rsquo;t always get email addresses and even if you do, you don&rsquo;t have permission to email them anyway because of the  <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\" target=\"_blank\">  CAN-SPAM Act </a>  (thank goodness). Focus your efforts on attracting your ideal customers to you and providing them plenty of opportunity and incentive to share their information with you on their own terms. The marketing list you can build by being intentional with who you target and how you add value first in order to earn trust and information will be far more valuable to you than the outdated, dusty marketing list you purchase.</p><h3> 7. Radio Commercials</h3><p> Does anyone want to listen through radio commercials? Have they ever? And with digital streaming stations, you&rsquo;d be lucky if your target audience is even tuned in to hear it. Start a podcast or guest on a podcast instead. You&rsquo;ll add way more value than your 30 second jingle and someone might even hear it.</p><p> For small businesses, it&rsquo;s important that you stay laser focused on your ideal customer and align your spending with marketing efforts that add the most value to them (not just your brand). In terms of prioritizing your marketing dollars, I always recommend going the more honest and authentic route. Be thoughtful and avoid spending your marketing budget on things that take a broad and general approach to reaching your ideal audiences, especially if you can&rsquo;t quantify the return on your investment.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll follow-up next week with a post on the things small business SHOULD spend their marketing budgets on. Till then, take care and keep on!</p>",

Search Results: Who is the competition for search traffic?</h3><p> A non-branded, non-location specific search for &ldquo;Retirement Calculator&rdquo; brings up the following listings:</p><li> CNN Money</li><li> Bloomberg</li><li> Charles Schwab</li><li> Bankrate.com</li><li> Vanguard</li><li> AARP</li><li> FINRA</li><li> CalcXML</li><li> U.S. News &amp; World Report</li><li> T. RowePrice</li><p> . . . pretty stiff competition.</p><h3> 3. Historical Results: Client specific data from Google Analytics for the past year.</h3><p> Looking through Google Analytics, I found the following data related to their calculator pages for the past year:</p><li> they were viewed a total of 55 times by 47 unique visitors &ndash; less than 1% of all visitors went to any of the 10 available calculators</li><li> the calculators were entry pages, meaning visitors found the website because of the calculators, only 5 times</li><li> the average time on a calculator page was 2.57 minutes <br/>  </li><h3> Recommendations</h3><p> <br/> This case study is obviously far from an empirical study on calculator use on Financial Advisor websites, however it did provide information that can be applied to other advisors.</p><li> Know your reason for offering calculators. Don&rsquo;t expect it to increase your search traffic. The chances of out-ranking one of the national companies that are showing up in the search results is almost zero.</li><li> Few visitors used this client&rsquo;s calculators. Although, this might not be the case for your calculators should you choose to offer them, be sure to follow up by checking your Google Analytics data to be sure.</li><li> Look for less expensive calculators. If they don&rsquo;t offer a huge return, don&rsquo;t invest as much in them. <br/>  </li><p> Although I don&rsquo;t see specific disadvantages (besides cost) to offering calculators, definitely consider your budget and goals when contemplating adding them to your website. If you are on a limited budget, it may not be the most cost effective use of your marketing dollars.</p><p> I am currently looking into more cost effective calculators for WordPress websites. I hope to be able to offer a review article on my findings soon.</p><p> What has your experience with Calculators on your website been. Have you seen a lot of use? Gained or maintained clients because of them?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Amy Sitnick </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SEI  </a> </u></p><h3> Deactivating a Client&rsquo;s Digital Real Estate </h3><p> <strong>  Have you experienced this scenario? </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;re checking your Facebook account at the end of the day and you see terrible news. Your friend Maria&rsquo;s husband, Robert, who has been sick, has passed away. You express your condolences and share happy memories of what the person meant to you.</p><p> But then six months goes by. It&rsquo;s Robert&rsquo;s birthday. You see numerous people posting on his Facebook wall, saying how much they miss him. Others who aren&rsquo;t aware of Robert&rsquo;s passing write things like &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get together soon.&rdquo; This is awkward for the loved ones, anyone who&rsquo;s connected to the family, and probably soon for the unaware well-wishers themselves.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s blog post isn&rsquo;t exactly a happy one to write, however, I think it&rsquo;s an important one for you to read and be familiar with.</p><p> Who&rsquo;s in charge when it comes to digital property? Who wants to approach a widow who is grieving about taking down the deceased&rsquo;s account? Do family members have the right to access their loved ones&rsquo; account after a death? Would the individual who has passed want family members to access their content, or to have the account removed? Is it possible to commemorate the individual by memorializing the individual&rsquo;s account?</p><p> In our exploding digital world, it&rsquo;s essential to help clients plan for both their real-life estates, but also their digital estate plan as well.</p><h3> The Growing Importance of Digital Real Estate Planning</h3><p> <br/> These conversations go well beyond social media. They&rsquo;re important for all the digital assets of the individual, including email accounts and websites for online bill paying, retail accounts such as PayPal, photo sharing and more. These sites contain sensitive personal information and financial data that could pose privacy concerns if left unattended indefinitely.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s get started by reviewing end-of-life planning and guidelines for discontinuing the social media accounts of a loved one. For our purposes today, we&rsquo;ll discuss the most popular social networking sites.</p><h3> Wait &ndash; Is Social Media Planning Really an Advisor&rsquo;s Job?</h3><p> <br/> You might wonder if this is actually your role as a financial advisor. However, I think this is a major planning need for your clients, and one they may not be thinking about. It&rsquo;s one where you can provide a real benefit.</p><p> In general, social media users have not yet realized this is an issue and it is a big one. As an advisor, your role in these sensitive conversations can be helpful in a little understood space and can help provide respect to an individual who has passed. So, despite its morbidity, it&rsquo;s important to address it with clients.</p><p> After all, as your client&rsquo;s financial advisor, they&rsquo;ve entrusted you with growing and protecting their wealth and achieving their personal financial goals. Your ability to collaborate across family relationships and with other advisors such as attorneys on sensitive topics uniquely positions you to raise this topic.</p><p> If these choices are made before a death and carefully planned, individuals have a better chance of making sure their digital assets are handled exactly the way they would want them to be &ndash; protecting both their privacy and their legacy.</p><p> In addition, you can benefit from additional client stickiness if you advise clients on the issue and provide tools to help them.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you actually perform this service on the individual&rsquo;s behalf &ndash; that&rsquo;s up to you. However, I&rsquo;d like to provide you with some pointers to pass along to the family &ndash; and tips for you to consider for your own planning needs.</p><h3> Tactful End-of-Life Planning for Digital Real Estate</h3><p> <br/> With social media adoption at all time highs, we&rsquo;re truly only beginning to deal with this topic. In my opinion, it will eventually become commonplace to discuss social media and a person&rsquo;s digital footprint when preparing long-term financial plans and wills.</p><p> Right now, most people don&rsquo;t know where to start. One thing is certain &ndash; no one wants to put their loved ones in the awkward position of having to decide what to do with their accounts during this sensitive time period.</p><h3> But how? Here are some pointers:</h3><li> <strong>  Incorporate social media account transition into planning conversations </strong> , especially with multiple generations. Some key questions to ask: <li>  What social media platforms does the individual use? </li> <li>  What are the person&rsquo;s passwords? </li> <li>  What would the individual like to happen to their accounts upon their death? </li></li><li> <strong>  Document the stated goals </strong>  and if applicable, share these with the client&rsquo;s attorney or whomever your client deems as their  <a href=\"http://www.nextavenue.org/article/2012-05/5-steps-creating-your-digital-estate-plan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Digital Executor  </u>  .&rdquo; </a></li><li> <strong>  Leverage Technology. </strong>  There are many client portals available today to house important client documents.  <u>  Estate Assist </u>  is one service designed especially for investors as well as advisors to archive vital family information, including social media accounts and passwords. <br/>  </li><h3> When Someone Passes Suddenly: Planning Considerations for the Unplanned</h3><p> <br/> When individuals pass suddenly or if they haven&rsquo;t outlined their wishes for terminating a social media account, each of the major social media channels will typically request legal documentation in order to begin the closure process (check out this helpful infographic from  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/social-media-death/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mashable  </a> </u> ).</p><p> However, this is a very new area and each of these sites is in its infancy in terms of putting together policies.  We have heard of heartbreaking stories of people who have put all of their photos on Facebook and haven&rsquo;t provided anyone with their password. Upon their passing, Facebook was not able to give the family access to the account and all of the photos were lost.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a quick run down of what is required when discontinuing a social media account:</p><p> <strong>  &bull;  </strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/150486848354038\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   <strong>    Facebook   </strong>  </u>  : </a>   Facebook has two options for what to do with a deceased family member&rsquo;s account.</p><li> <strong>  Memorializing a Profile:  </strong> This feature allows the account to be viewed but not edited (with the exception of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/12/facebook-policy-change-allows-one-final-post-after-death/23184757/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Legacy Contact now being allowed to make one final post  </a> </u> , usually regarding funeral arrangements, etc.)</li><li> <strong>  Terminating an Account: </strong>  An individual can deactivate a profile by completing Special Request for Deceased Person&rsquo;s Account; it is necessary to provide your relationship as well as a copy of the individual&rsquo;s death certificate, the deceased person&rsquo;s birth certificate, or proof of authority.</li><p> <strong>  &bull; LinkedIn: </strong>  You have two options to handle a deceased person&rsquo;s account.</p><li> If you have the password of the individual, you may follow  <a href=\"https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63/~/closing-your-account\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   LinkedIn&rsquo;s instructions to simply close the account  </u>  .  </a></li><li> However, if you do not, there is a  <a href=\"https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2842\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   process to terminate the account  </u>    </a> that requires you to provide certain information about the deceased person.</li><p> <strong>  Who Can Do It:  </strong> In LinkedIn&rsquo;s case, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be an immediate family member to terminate an account. It can be any one of the following: Immediate family (spouse, parent, sibling, child), extended family (grandparent, aunt, uncle, cousin), non-family (friend, co-worker, classmate).</p><p> <strong>  &bull; Twitter:  </strong> Twitter will work with the estate or immediate family members to remove an account.</p><li> <strong>  What is needed: </strong>  Fax Twitter copies of the death certificate and your government-issued ID (such as a driver&rsquo;s license), along with a signed, notarized statement and either a link to an online obituary or a copy of the obituary from a local paper.</li><li> <strong>  Who can do it:  </strong> A verified immediate family member of the deceased or a person authorized to act on the behalf of the estate.</li><p> &bull;  <strong>  YouTube: </strong> Since YouTube is now affiliated with Google, you need to reference the policies on Google&rsquo;s site. Google has a process in place for immediate family members and representatives. It provides for a number of options, including closing the account and requesting funds from the account.</p><li> <strong>  What is needed: </strong>  To terminate your YouTube account, you can  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/deceased?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   begin the process here  </u>  . </a></li><p> Keep in mind that social media accounts often change their policies and it&rsquo;s important to revisit procedures even after you&rsquo;ve had a conversation about terminating a person&rsquo;s digital assets.</p><h3> In Memoriam</h3><p> <br/> What do you think about this topic? Have you counseled clients through these complex issues created by our brave new world? If yes, what has been your experience? If not, what other questions do you have?</p>",

    "content": "<p> People talk about the moral compass, and I&rsquo;ve often wondered how to define that. It&rsquo;s been described in the dictionary as <strong>  &lsquo;anything that serves to guide a person&rsquo;s decisions based on morals or virtues.' </strong></p><p> I have trouble with the word <strong>  &lsquo;moral&rsquo; </strong> because it&rsquo;s open to so many interpretations, and so I prefer to think of it as <strong>  &lsquo;doing the right thing&rsquo; </strong> . Of course, <strong>  doing the right thing is dependent on your values, and your sense of fairness, and things being &lsquo;right&rsquo;. But this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily explain what &lsquo;doing the right thing&rsquo; is, either. </strong></p><p> Language is a huge barrier sometimes. We all know individuals whose actions are caring, conscious, and conscientious. Many times we admire them for their courage too, because they don&rsquo;t take the easy road. Their lives may seem so far away from ours, and yet, our common thread is that we all share the same desire to be better than we are.</p><p> Recently, a friend sent me an article written by David Brooks called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/david-brooks-the-moral-bucket-list.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">   The Moral Bucket List  </a> </u>  and it struck a chord. Take the time to read it. It will uplift you. </p><p> He gave examples of people who hold an inner light, always in service of others, and who inspire it in others. These are people who don&rsquo;t give much attention to their worldly status, or career path, but are more concerned with the impact it has on other people, and do their best to shine that light on them. Some of our best leaders have that trait.</p><p> He also spoke about the eulogy virtues vs the resume virtues, and said that while we are encouraged to build an external career, we are not taught how to build our inner character. By living for external achievement, we leave unexplored the deeper meaning of life that brings joy, and connects you with what really matters.</p><p> This is the piece I call self-mastery. The courage to confront you by opening awareness of your true strengths and weaknesses, and your ability to take that into the world with confidence and courage to serve others as authentically as you can.</p><p> We may go to our graves being lauded for our professional achievements, but the most meaningful praise will be that we made a difference in the life of someone else, and we were true to ourselves. </p><p> <strong>  One of the gifts of having a strong &lsquo;do the right thing&rsquo; is your ability to honestly confront your weaknesses. </strong> I&rsquo;m naturally an impatient woman, and over the years, I&rsquo;ve had to regulate my impatience. I also used to be very quick to blame, and I&rsquo;ve learned that blame and judgment only escalate the conflicts. There are other weaknesses that I&rsquo;m prone to, but this is not the time to air the dirty laundry!</p><p> The point is, if it had not been for the strong, supportive and encouraging teachers, coaches, colleagues and friends, not to mention my husband, who helped me raise my awareness of these elements of personality that weakened me, and taught me to be more honest with myself, I might still be missing my &lsquo;moral compass&rsquo;, and I would not have the opportunity to teach these same things to the men and women I coach.</p><p> Brooks says, <strong>  &ldquo;External success is achieved through competition with others. But character is built during the confrontation with your own weakness.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> After a lifetime of fighting battles with myself, and others, I&rsquo;ve learned that our greatest weaknesses are our greatest strengths misapplied. With some compassion, forgiveness, and conscious living you can discover the tools to establish the life you choose to live, not the life that feels like you've been chosen to live.</p><p> Life is a process. We commit ourselves to being a better person over and over again, until the lessons we have learned are instilled in us naturally. We take these challenging, sometimes painful journeys to discover the essence of who we are, to do what's right, and to become the person we always wanted to be. </p><p> We all have a moral compass. What&rsquo;s yours?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Engagement doesn&rsquo;t happen without ownership and hard work. It can&rsquo;t just fall on the shoulders of one person, but rather requires equal but different contributions from senior leaders, managers and employees alike.  That&rsquo;s how you can create the magic of an engaged and committed workforce.  While everyone needs to be responsible for engagement, I&rsquo;d like to focus today on the critical role that one of these three groups needs to take on to create an engaged workforce, and that&rsquo;s managers.</p><p> But before we dive into the 5 Must Do&rsquo;s, we need to answer an important question,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ruthkross.com/why-are-managers-like-an-accordion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   why are managers like an accordion  </a> </u> ? Think about it this way, in order to make sweet music (aka engagement) come out of that cumbersome instrument, both sides need to be embraced in perfect harmony. The left keyboard on the accordion stands for top management, handing down a mandate to produce more, in a faster timeframe, all the while keeping resources flat or even reduced. The right keyboard stands for employees who require more of management&rsquo;s time, energy and support. Each side relies on the other for that sweet music to be made.</p><p> Therein lies the lasting conundrum. How are managers supposed to keep both of these sides playing in harmony, creating in-tune music together that results in higher engagement, increased productivity, customer satisfaction and increased revenue? Managers can&rsquo;t play a harmonious tune if even one person on their team is disengaged. It&rsquo;s like trying to play a song on a piano missing a key. In today&rsquo;s tough business environment, managers can&rsquo;t afford to have a team working for them that is not fully engaged. Even worse, if your manager is operating on a low battery, then how can you expect him or her to charge and reengage others?</p><p> Managers have my greatest respect as they play an enormously important role in the journey toward reaching full engagement. Here are my 5 Manager Must Do Tips to create an engaged workforce.</p><p> <strong>  1. Managers are the catalyst for linking people to work </strong> <br/> People want and need to feel emotionally connected to their work and the workplace environment. Their direct manager is the conduit to making that tight connection. If the connection is frayed, the rope linking them together will break.</p><p> <strong>  2. A good manager makes people feel valued </strong> <br/> How hard is it to show people that they are appreciated for the work they do? It doesn&rsquo;t take much to convey that they are valued through a word or gesture of thanks. A surefire technique to make someone feel less valued is to micromanage him or her.</p><p> <strong>  3. Instill trust through transparency </strong> <br/> Similar to what is expected of senior leadership, line managers should uphold the company&rsquo;s commitment to transparency by being honest and forthright with their employees. You don&rsquo;t want to be the one to start the water cooler chatter by creating an environment of secrecy and closed-door conversations.</p><p> <strong>  4. Give employees the tools and processes they need to be effective in their jobs </strong> <br/> How many of us can remember starting a new job and not even having a computer or access to the company&rsquo;s systems on day one or two or three? I know I can. There is nothing worse than being expected to perform a task for which you have no training or tools to accomplish your goals.</p><p> <strong>  5. Paint an exciting picture for the future of what could be and should be, regardless of what is. </strong> <br/> Like an exciting journey, it all starts with a roadmap that may involve some detours along the way. But, regardless of the obstacles that prevent themselves, managers should always have an ultimate goal in sight and navigate their employees there.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Online social networks are changing how businesses and their leaders communicate and leverage their most valuable asset: their relationships.</p><p> In this series of articles, entitled  <u>  <a href=\"http://jaypalter.ca/tag/new-rules-of-engagement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   New Rules of Engagement  </a> </u> , I profile a business leader that I have observed to be using social networks actively and effectively in their leadership role.</p><p> This week, I talk with Augie Ray, Director of Voice of Customer at a Fortune 100 Financial Services Company.</p><h3> <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Augie Ray  <br/>  Director of Voice of Customer </strong> at a Fortune 100 Financial Services Company <br/> Blog &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.experiencetheblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Experience the Blog  </a> </u> <br/> Twitter &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/augieray\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @augieray  </a> </u> <br/> LinkedIn &ndash;  <u>  Augie Ray </u></p><h3> Jay Palter (JP): Why do you invest your limited time to engage in social networks?</h3><p> <strong>  Augie Ray (AR): </strong> I sometimes ask myself this question. Between blogging, helping to administer a group on LinkedIn and engaging in the dialog on social networks, it is a considerable chunk of time. I think there is more than one answer.</p><p> First, I learn a lot &ndash; the people with which I network surface interesting and pertinent news and share insights and analysis that help me on the job. Second, I have a big drive to try to educate and to dispel myths, which is why I so enjoyed my job at Forrester and continue to blog, even though I&rsquo;m on the client side and have no service, book or product to &ldquo;sell.&rdquo;</p><p> Last, I feel my social networking can help my career, although I&rsquo;m also aware of the ways it may hinder it. On the positive side, my blogging and networking (both online and off) help to raise my visibility and strengthen my relationships. In fact, I can point to a single blog post I wrote that was instrumental in helping me land a job. There is a downside too. I once wrote a blog post critical of a social company, and since they were a partner of the firm at which I worked, it raised a few eyebrows and called into question if I was being a &ldquo;team player.&rdquo; It can sometimes be difficult to be a provocative, candid and challenging voice in the industry while working at a more traditional client-side firm rather than a research firm, agency or consulting organization.</p><h3> JP: What social networks or tools do you consider essential and why?</h3><p> <strong>  AR: </strong> The big three social networks are all important to me.</p><p> Twitter is a great place for learning, connecting and promoting my blog. LinkedIn also fills those same needs, particularly since they launched their publishing tool last year. And Facebook is essential not just for personal networking, but has grown in value for professional networking, as well.</p><p> If Google+, Pinterest, Vine, Ello or even Instagram (on which I am quite active) disappeared tomorrow, I would hardly feel it. But life without Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook would feel very different.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/augieray\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"augie-ray-twitter\" src=\"http://jaypalter.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/augie-ray-twitter.png\"/> </a></p><h3> JP: What techniques or habits have you developed to make time in your busy schedule for social?</h3><p> <strong>  AR: </strong> Mobile is key to making time in my schedule. When I have a couple minutes free, I actively check my stream. I also devour a huge amount of information every day, and if I read something interesting, I assume others might find it interesting, as well, so it gets posted.  <u>  <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flipboard  </a> </u>  helps to surface interesting news worth sharing, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buffer  </a> </u>  is a great tool for managing cross-posting to my social accounts and timing of posts.</p><p> While that is my tactical answer, here is my more philosophical answer: I feel as if I have a constant dialog underway in social networks, and so attending to that becomes something vital to do throughout the day, just as I would give my attention to a conversation underway in the real world.</p><h3> JP: What specific benefits would you attribute to your social networking activities?</h3><p> <strong>  AR: </strong> As I mentioned, I know of at least one blog post of mine that assisted me in landing a job at Forrester. The post was critical of a Forrester report and it sparked a dialog with two analysts. When a position came open a few months later, I was able to leverage that discussion and those relationships to get my hat in the ring. Of course, after that, it was a lot of hard work to land the job, but I would not have been in that original pool of candidates without my blog post and the conversation it encouraged.</p><p> I also get quite a lot out of my blogging, and I have spoken about this a couple of times at events. I recommend everyone do some sort of &ldquo;blogging&rdquo; professionally, whether they actually publish it or simple write things that remain private. For me, blogging offers a number of professional benefits. For one, it forces me to keep up with trends and news, which is always helpful on the job.</p><p> Blogging also sharpens my ideas and opinions. I sometimes sit down to write on a topic about which I feel quite confident, but the process of fashioning the logical argument and finding data to support my contentions can sometimes prove that my concept is not nearly as defensible as I thought. Sometimes, I even end up convincing myself I was wrong through the process of research and analysis. In the end, when I write a blog post, it becomes a full-blown idea I can call on in any conversation or meeting. I am simply better prepared and more informed because the blogging process forces it upon me.</p><p> And on a personal basis, I have made friends and built relationships thanks to my blogging and social networking. I can&rsquo;t measure the ROI of that, but I value those people in my life.</p><h3> JP: What&rsquo;s one piece of advice that you have for your peers about social networking?</h3><p> <strong>  AR: </strong> Don&rsquo;t think of social networking as something you need to schedule a half hour for every day. Think of it as the mortar in your day that fills in around the bricks of your schedule. Finding five minutes six times a day is easier to do than carving out a half hour. Plus your more frequent real-time interactions will improve your social networking engagement.</p><p> Also, be aware of the risks and the rules. Know your company&rsquo;s social media guidelines and be aware of the way anyone can react to your posts and tweets. It&rsquo;s all fun and games until you post something that is considered a sales pitch for your company, that reveals some confidential information about a company vendor or that rubs someone the wrong way. There is no need to be fearful &ndash; just be smart!</p><h3> Takeaways</h3><p> Augie Ray is the epitome of a social business executive, one who has figured out how to grow his personal brand and leverage it within his professional activities.</p><p> Augie is an active listener and recognizes that what he learns from social networks may be its most important benefit. Though he doesn&rsquo;t use the term &ldquo;social capital&rdquo;, he clearly acknowledges that the interactions and engagement with people in his online networks have an impact on his career. Augie is clearly a creative, truth-seeker and a leader that isn&rsquo;t afraid to put his truth-seeking out there.</p><p> One of the keys to Augie&rsquo;s social networking success is his writing and blogging. His explanation for why he pours so much effort into it is reminiscent to me how  <u>  <a href=\"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/02/10-lessons-reformedbroker-can-teach-social/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Josh Brown describes the reason he writes  </a> </u> : it helps him figure out what he&rsquo;s thinking. This clarification process helps Augie in many ways professionally &ndash; and it would benefit many business leaders to do the same.</p><p> To me, this is one of the most important takeaways for business leaders: people want to know how and why you do what you do. They want to know how you think. Whether it&rsquo;s your peers and colleagues, or your customers and prospects, or even your internal team or a future employer, there are enormous benefits of getting out there and sharing your vision and thought process. It contributes to the know, like and trust factor that drives so much of business. And it will make you a better decision-maker.</p><p> Of course, you need to be mindful of your pronouncements in social networks and the impact they might have on those around you. Augie suggests you be &ldquo;smart&rdquo; (and I would add &ldquo;strategic&rdquo;) in the discussions you choose to publically engage in.</p>",

    "title": "Feeling Frustrated by Feedback (or the lack thereof)? 5 Keys to Help Feedback Flourish",
    "link": "feeling-frustrated-by-feedback-or-the-lack-thereof-5-keys-to-help-feedback-flourish",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Employees are a company&rsquo;s biggest asset. The success or failure of any company is largely determined by how skillful, motivated and productive its employees are. </strong> <strong>  An environment of trust and open communication is crucial for developing an organizational culture in which employees can perform at their peak ability and capacity. </strong> Managers benefit by creating and fostering such an environment, and in order to be successful, both managers and employees must be able to exercise a critical skill of giving, as well as receiving, feedback.</p><p> The many advantages of constructive feedback are widely acknowledged and hailed by a vast majority of present-day business leaders. Timely and sound feedback allows for expedient evaluation and optimization of the employee&rsquo;s performance, which in turn streamlines organizational processes and communication flow, obviating numerous potential setbacks and the need to spend time and resources correcting them. While recognizing the benefits of constructive feedback, scores of managers and company employees quickly lose their nerve at the thought of personally giving or receiving feedback, and try everything in their power to avoid dealing with it altogether.</p><p> <strong>  In the minds of far too many, &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; has developed a negative connotation. </strong> Psychologically damaging effects of the negative past experiences of being exposed to verbal attacks, poorly constructed criticism or meaningless advice &ndash; all conveniently labeled &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; &ndash; usually prove to be a main cause of the feedback-associated apprehension or fear. If the employee&rsquo;s response to the manager&rsquo;s feedback is lukewarm at best, there are undoubtedly some roadblocks at play that cause the effectiveness and value of managerial feedback to diminish. Some of the most common impediments to effective feedback are:</p><li> Lack of preparation for the feedback</li><li> Lack of time discussing the feedback</li><li> Vagueness and poor phrasing</li><li> Being affected by emotions</li><li> Fear of upsetting or angering the recipient</li><li> Fear of straining personal relationships</li><li> Fear of blemishing a personal image</li><li> Fear of ruining team dynamics</li><li> Fear of backlash</li><li> Defensive reaction of the recipient</li><li> Denial or lack of understanding on the recipient&rsquo;s part</li><li> Difficulty dealing with anything that seems like &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Both reinforcing (positive) and corrective (negative) feedback are valuable learning experiences. It seems logical that good, constructive feedback provides its recipients with important pieces of information that has power to help them do a better job in the future. <strong>  Effective feedback will motivate its receiver to improve and strive to do well, whereas poor quality feedback will only confuse and exasperate. </strong> Oftentimes, having received terribly constructed and delivered feedback, employees feel helpless, unappreciated or looked down upon by their colleagues, team leaders or managers, and instead of learning from that experience they would condemn the one who gave them the evaluation.</p><p> Between unclear and inaccurate feedback, the former is the lesser of two evils; unsound feedback not only leads to bitterness and outrage, but it also undermines the manager&rsquo;s trustworthiness &ndash; and therefore authority &ndash; in the eyes of the employees. When administering corrective feedback, it is imperative for the manager to be open to discussion, in addition to being well-informed and objective.</p><p> Positive feedback, on the other hand, although less &ldquo;popular&rdquo; than corrective, is just as essential for employees&rsquo; success. Mistakenly, many managers believe that reinforcing feedback is limited to &ldquo;You did well!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Great job&rdquo;. Neither one should be considered feedback, as they provide no analysis, advice, plan of action or any other learning opportunities. They are simply trite statements that have no real value to their recipients. Employees need to understand exactly what they are doing well. Not only that, they need to be able to take that knowledge and apply it in future to ensure continuous improvement. If the feedback employees receive has no substance to it, no improvement will take place.</p><p> It is certainly easier to hear what we want or like to hear, rather than what is necessary; however, the latter is far more meaningful and significant for the personal, as well as professional, learning and development of any individual. Research shows that most leaders understand this fact, and therefore willingly seek feedback from others. Based on a study of 51,896 executives, professional services firm Zenger Folkman discovered that leaders who ask for feedback are substantially more effective than those who do not. For instance, the research findings demonstrate that leaders who ranked at the top 10% in asking for feedback were rated, on average, at the 86th percentile in overall leadership effectiveness:</p><br /><p> In a smaller study of 22,719 leaders, Zenger Folkman unveiled a relationship between feedback and employee engagement levels: The leaders who ranked in the top 10% in their ability to give honest feedback received engagement scores from their subordinates in the 77th percentile in engagement, and conversely the leaders who ranked at the bottom 10% got engagement scores that averaged in the 25th percentile:</p><br /><p> The value of constructive feedback &ndash; to employees, managers and companies &ndash; cannot be overemphasized. Think through and keep in mind the following recommendations to guarantee that the next time you give feedback it is on point:</p><li> <strong>  Plan ahead. </strong> The best kind of feedback &ndash; in terms of time &ndash; is the one that is given on a regular and continuous basis. Feedback is not to be given only when the problem arises; you should approach feedback as a regular part of your managerial responsibilities. In cases where a problem needs to be addressed, your feedback should follow closely, so that appropriate corrections and adjustments can be made in a timely manner. Effective feedback requires careful preparation, so make sure you give yourself enough time to review and analyze all the aspects of the scenario. You must be well-informed in order to avoid delivering feedback that is superficial or unjust.</li><li> <strong>  Mind the differences in behavioral style. </strong> There is no point to great feedback that only overwhelms and confuses employees. Your feedback may be well-constructed, insightful and actionable, but if the recipient does not understand what it implies then your efforts have been wasted. Don&rsquo;t generalize!  <u>  Different people have their own individual behavioral styles </u> , and different approaches to problem solving, communicating, and addressing issues. An approach that might work for one person will not necessarily work for another. You need to understand the people you are addressing, the way they take in the information, the way they process it. People function best within their own style; you need to adapt to those particular styles to achieve maximum effectiveness.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t attack people, attack problems. </strong> When personalities collide and tensions run high, it becomes very easy to get caught up in the blaming game. You have to be objective and civilized; don&rsquo;t turn this learning opportunity for your subordinates into a skirmish or a personal vendetta of some kind. Instead, focus on the underlying causes of a problem and possible solutions. Don&rsquo;t criticize &ndash; discuss! Instead of &ldquo;You never talk in meetings. You are too quiet,&rdquo; try something like &ldquo;You seemed preoccupied in the last meeting when Joe asked you a question. Why did you respond as you did?&rdquo; Effective feedback usually takes the shape of a dialogue, and not a one-way torrent of condemnation.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t assume they know what you mean. </strong> People cannot read each other&rsquo;s minds; why do we always seem to forget such overt and straightforward truth? There is no guarantee that just because you understand what you are trying to convey, others will be able to comprehend your perspective. Don&rsquo;t hint or tip-toe around the problem &ndash; you need to be specific. In your feedback, tell the employees exactly what they do well and not so well, what are their areas for improvement and ways in which they can do it. Be meticulous. Use examples and avoid ambiguity at all costs.</li><li> <strong>  Walk the talk. </strong> If you are going to give feedback to others, you must also ask for it. You need to show your employees that feedback is not an exclusively managerial instrument of power. Nor is it a way to put down people; whether people like it or not, it is still a learning experience, an opportunity to improve, for everyone. Show your employees that you are open to their feedback. This two-way-street approach to feedback is going to help create a culture of open communication and trust, facilitating stronger relationships between management and employees.</li>",

It just means you&rsquo;re not engineering enough opportunities to improve.If you&rsquo;re reading this blog, you likely have intentions of becoming a better, more successful, and meaningful financial planner. But how often do your intentions turn into action?Intentions, unfortunately, are as weak as a lazy summer breeze. They are too easily overcome by the seemingly urgent demands of everyday life. The best way to improve, is to commit to something that will force you to raise your game.Want to improve your knowledge? Sign up for a tax-training-courseWant to improve your presentation skills?

Enter an online training course on making your financial planning service irresistible to your ideal prospectsBut first, ask yourself this question: do you really, really believe you need to get better? (Or do you believe you&rsquo;re already good enough?)Let&rsquo;s check it out.<h3> 5 Levels of Financial Planning</h3>This is not about designations. This is about your potential for future success. And judging from feedback from my readers, many planners are stuck at level 1&hellip;<h3> Level 1: The Technical Planner</h3>The Technical Planner is a financial planner who works orking for a large company. When there&rsquo;s a job offered, and you have proof you&rsquo;re good at technical work (because you have a FP-designation), you&rsquo;re set. When you have the job, the client mostly doesn&rsquo;t care about you, as a person.People think: If the company is good, the financial planner is probably good as well. If they think otherwise, you&rsquo;re in trouble.The good news about being a Technical Planner, is that you never have to worry about any marketing, you never have to worry about how to get your next client. Prospects show up, not because of you. But because you work for the company.The bad news is, you are generic. You are a cog in the system that is run by somebody else.There are LOTS of financial planners who don&rsquo;t want to be at level 1, but don&rsquo;t know how to make the leap to level 5 (because that&rsquo;s the best leap. Trust me, you&rsquo;ll see).The Technical Planner&rsquo;s message is: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a professional, can I work for you?&rdquo;<h3> Level 2: The Local Planner</h3>The Local Planner has a business because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;around&rdquo;. Right around the corner, the &ldquo;easiest one&rdquo;, the one to grab. There&rsquo;s an advantage to being a Local Planner, if there are lots of people around you who need your service.That&rsquo;s why most Local Planners are product-selling-financial-planners.Because most people believe they don&rsquo;t need financial planning. Instead, they do need a mortgage or life-insurance. Oh, and maybe some (commission-based) financial planning to go along with it.The Local Planner&rsquo;s message is: &ldquo;If you need financial advice, come to me (because I&rsquo;m nearby)&rdquo;.But you can do better than that.<h3> Level 3: The Expert Planner</h3>The Expert Planner is a financial planner who has invested lots and lots of time and energy in becoming the most knowledgeable planner that ever existed. The Expert Planner is almost by definition &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the competition.People notice him because of his designation-arsenal, experience and extensive knowledge. He (hopes to) get(s) picked.The truth is, he doesn&rsquo;t get picked often enough (although he&rsquo;s truly the best). You see, most people won&rsquo;t bother noticing, because they aren&rsquo;t looking. They don&rsquo;t have time to seek out if you&rsquo;re better than the competition. Because there&rsquo;s just too much to look at nowadays, and not enough time to take it all in.The Expert Planner&rsquo;s message is: &ldquo;If you want the best financial planner, come to me&rdquo;.That doesn&rsquo;t bring the results you deserve, unless you take it to the next level.<h3> Level 4: The Niche Planner</h3>These planners are &ldquo;the one and only&rdquo;. They best serve their target audience. Audiences like airline pilots, medical specialist, or teachers. They focus on &ldquo;who they do it for&rdquo;.And that&rsquo;s why those planners do get noticed. People recognize themselves in who the planners say they serve best.The Niche Planner&rsquo;s message is: &ldquo;If you want to be served by someone who really knows you, come to me&rdquo;Still, they get noticed, but do clients engage with you? Do they refer you?Do they buy your service?Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting something?<h3> Level 5: The Irresistible Planner</h3>This is the connector.This is the planner who does work people MUST talk about. This is the planner who stands out, because the financial planning service, the experience, the engagement is worth talking about. It&rsquo;s not better by definition, but it&rsquo;s so engaging, you cannot help but talk about it.People want to belong to this planner&rsquo;s community.Irresistible planners understand they need to find a different community, with a different worldview that wants to hear a different story. They understand they need to invent an entirely new story that is framed around the worldview of an underserved community.And there is a huge amount of people who are underserved by the financial services industry &hellip;People WANT to buy financial planning from this type of financial planner, because he makes them feel how they want to feel.The Irresistible Planner&rsquo;s message is: &ldquo;If you want to feel &hellip;&hellip;. then come to me (because I&rsquo;m like you)&rdquo;Level 5: What&rsquo;s the First Step to becoming an Irresistible Planner?<h3> It&rsquo;s all about your Hook.</h3>Your hook is your remarkable promise about your financial planning service, but in its raw idea form.But watch out!You can&rsquo;t tell a selfish story from your point of view. You also can&rsquo;t invent an inauthentic story.The only hooks that work are the &lsquo;WOW, is this for real &ndash; hooks&rsquo;The problem is that most planners keep on making the same mistakes when creating their hook (I&rsquo;ll tell you how to create your hook in a minute).<h3> 3 Big Mistakes When Crafting Your Hook</h3><strong> Mistake #1:</strong>Your story, website and content is haphazardMost planners think of every potential topic that might be applicable to their audience, and then shower them with content from every angle. They say, &ldquo;I was told to deliver value, and I did!&rdquo;For example: lots of planners tweet about any financial topic that comes along.While planners who make this mistake have the best intentions, they ultimately end up confusing and overwhelming their prospects. And after they hear your story, they&rsquo;re no closer to solving their problem than they were before, because it&rsquo;s all over the place.In reality, what&rsquo;s happening is this &mdash; When most of us sit down to create a valuable message for our customers, we don&rsquo;t know what to talk about, so we talk about as much as possible. Wealth management. Debt management. Retirement planning. Estate planning. Superannuation. Salary packaging. Getting divorced. Getting married. Seeking financial freedom.We don&rsquo;t want to leave anything out. So, we&rsquo;re just throwing it at our audience, like, &ldquo;Here! Read this! Hire me for this!&rdquo; And we cross our fingers, hoping people will call us.They won&rsquo;t.A haphazard message will scare a bunch of potential customers away &mdash; those who don&rsquo;t quite know and trust you yet or aren&rsquo;t quite sure if they want your service.<strong> Mistake #2:</strong>Your story, website and content doesn&rsquo;t establish you as someone people can trustThis is a big one. Believe it or not, many planners talk about financial planning as if they are saying, &ldquo;I have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo; And it has nothing to do with whether they actually do know or don&rsquo;t.They&rsquo;re just not including the right information in their message. They think, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m talking about financial planning, I don&rsquo;t need to show them why I&rsquo;m qualified. They obviously know this already.&rdquo;But remember, most people don&rsquo;t understand the value of financial planning. They&rsquo;re not sure about the big benefit of financial planning. The effect is you haven&rsquo;t quite convinced them. They might have a mild interest in what you have to say, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they know you or know why you&rsquo;re qualified.You need to ensure people know who you are and why you&rsquo;re qualified to help them. They need to know you&rsquo;re an authority.<strong> Mistake #3:</strong>Your story, website and content doesn&rsquo;t establish you as someone people can like<strong> Trust is important, but when you&rsquo;re selling your service, being liked is just as important. Most planners think, &ldquo;What the heck? I&rsquo;m not trying to win a popularity contest. I&rsquo;m just trying to help people.&rdquo;</strong>But when people don&rsquo;t like you, you&rsquo;re creating a barrier between you and engaging people to buy your service that doesn&rsquo;t need to exist. Now, this doesn&rsquo;t mean you become some slimy salesman that tries to be liked by everyone. That&rsquo;s never going to work and people will be on to your trickery.Instead, what you need to do, is to not be scared to show the real you (as long as the real you relates to the worldview of your audience and your financial planning service).Sure, it will turn some people off, but it will also turn the right people on. The idea of making people like you isn&rsquo;t a new idea, either. Psychologist Robert Cialdini actually named Liking as one of his six weapons of influence in his persuasion manual,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006124189X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=006124189X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;linkId=M44QAC4SE4VVRMBP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>    </u></a><u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006124189X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=006124189X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;linkId=M44QAC4SE4VVRMBP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Influence  </u> </a> : The Psychology of Persuasion, Revised Edition</u><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006124189X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=006124189X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;linkId=M44QAC4SE4VVRMBP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=006124189X\"/> </u></a>That&rsquo;s how strong being liked plays a role in someone ending up choosing your service. Either way, it&rsquo;s important that your hook builds trust and likability.Now that we&rsquo;ve got those big mistakes out of the way, you&rsquo;re almost ready to begin brainstorming ideas for your hook.<h3> What&rsquo;s Your Hook About?</h3>Your hook is about positioning your financial planning service and what makes it unique from the rest of the market.Let me explain why you need it. And why it&rsquo;s vital that you don&rsquo;t skip it. This is so important, so I want to be sure you really get it.Okay, so first, remember this:Your Hook Is Why People Will Want To Listen To You (Not The Other Guy)Your hook is what helps you stand out from the competition. When you present your hook, you immediately contrast what you believe versus what other people believe. And this makes you stand out immediately. Even if your service isn&rsquo;t that unique, it&rsquo;s not nearly as important as showing people that &mdash; &ldquo;Yes, even though I say this, there are other people who say that. And they&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;(You don&rsquo;t have to be as aggressive as I&rsquo;m suggesting. But you do have to create that contrast and take a solid stance.)<h3> Here&rsquo;s an Example</h3>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re a financial planner for retired entrepreneurs, and your hook is:&ldquo;Most retired entrepreneurs base their decisions on analyzing what worked in the past. They rarely realize that it&rsquo;s far better to base their decisions by looking at what works in the future.&rdquo;The retired entrepreneurs decision process looks like this:1. Retired entrepreneur: &ldquo;The stock markets are doing well and I don&rsquo;t want to leave money on the table, but I&rsquo;m not sure about the future implications.&rdquo;2. Retired entrepreneur: &ldquo;I want to talk to someone who can help me with some advice&rdquo;<h3> Here&rsquo;s when you introduce your hook.</h3>3. &ldquo;Most advisors tell you to base your decisions on past returns, investing-experience and your risk profile. I&rsquo;m telling you that you don&rsquo;t want to do that. It&rsquo;s much better to base your decisions by first asking yourself what&rsquo;s important to YOU &ndash; now and in the future &ndash; so that your current decisions won&rsquo;t jeopardize your future welfare in any way.&rdquo;This immediately sets you apart from most other advisers out there. And, if you do it right, your audience will be sold on this idea. Then, throughout the rest of their journey, you&rsquo;ll keep reinforcing this idea to show your prospects the benefits of this approach.And that&rsquo;s the power of your hook. Because when customers believe your hook, then buying your financial planning service becomes a no-brainer.But you might think: this is difficult!Don&rsquo;t stress about it.You should come up with one hook, and if it&rsquo;s not perfect &mdash; that&rsquo;s okay!This can be your draft hook.Start building something today, and then improve upon it as you get more and more clear with the idea that you want to share with your audience.Again, let me emphasize &mdash; Your hook is merely the comparing and contrasting of what other people believe, and what you believe.<h3> Here&rsquo;s The Next Step</h3>So, why don&rsquo;t you try to create your hook?There are several options. You might want to experiment with your concept-hook on your prospects. That approach is probably the best way to test it. However, it takes (lots of) time &hellip;But if you don&rsquo;t want to do the hard work yourself, but instead save lots of time, you might want to use The Ultimate Worksheet To Create Your Hook (and Stand Out From the Crowd). The only thing you have to do is to answer the following question:What&rsquo;s the biggest &ldquo;mistaken belief&rdquo; your prospects have about reaching their biggest (financial) desire?Let&rsquo;s make financial planning matter.",

    "content": "<p> When you're ready to make or introduce a change in your organization, how do you tell employees about it? Or do you? <br/> <br/> Last week,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/04/successful-transformations-ugly-cx.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I wrote about  </a> </u>  some research that McKinsey did on organizational transformations. One of the findings was that  <strong>  communication </strong>  is key to a successful transformation. (This seems to be a no-brainer, but you'd be surprised.) <br/> <br/> How successful? McKinsey reports:</p><p> At companies where senior managers communicate openly and across the organization about the transformation&rsquo;s progress, respondents are 8.0 times as likely to report a successful transformation as those who say this communication doesn&rsquo;t happen. Good communication has an even greater effect at enterprise-wide transformations, where company-wide change efforts are 12.4 times more likely to be successful when senior managers communicate continually.</p><p> One of the questions that executives were asked as part of this research was whether or not they used a consistent <strong>   change story </strong>  to align the organization around the transformation's goals. The finding?</p><p> This type of communication is not common practice, though. When asked what they would do differently if the transformation happened again, nearly half of respondents (and the largest share) wish their organizations had spent more time communicating a change story.</p><p> We know that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/12/engage-your-audience-with-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stories are not only a powerful communication vehicle  </a> </u>  but also an important teaching tool.  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.intradiem.com/storytelling-customer-experience/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stories  </a> </u>  allow you to deliver a message in a way that engages people, inspires them, and helps them understand a desired or intended outcome as a result of a series of steps or actions taken. So it's not surprising that stories become an important tool in your communication toolbox. <br/> <br/> Why tell a  <strong>  change story </strong>  as opposed to some other way of communicating the changes, like dictating what's about to happen, which happens all too often? Dictating change is going to be faced with resistance, no doubt; stories, on the other hand, not only teach but also...</p><li> clarify and help employees/your audience understand</li><li> give background information</li><li> convey what the characters (employees, customers) think, do, feel</li><li> bring a concept or experience to life</li><li> engage employees</li><li> explain the ideal experience</li><li> sell (concepts and products)</li><li> support and reinforce the need for change</li><li> motivate and inspire</li><li> facilitate empathy and understanding</li><li> make people want to care</li><li> help employees connect</li><li> draw employees in, want to be a part of it</li><li> help employees relate</li><li> convey good and bad, successes and failures</li><li> are memorable <br/>  </li><p> It's not enough to just tell a story. You need to tell a specific story, and it needs to communicate:</p><li> the change, the vision</li><li> its purpose/raison d'etre</li><li> the intended outcome </li><li> employees'/participants' part in executing </li><li> impact on participants</li><li> impact on corporate culture</li><li> impact for customers and their experience</li><li> impact on the business <br/>  </li><p> Communicate early and often. Keep the story going. As changes are made, update the story. But keep telling it. <br/> <br/> Stories are the single most powerful tool in a leader&rsquo;s toolkit. -Howard Gardner</p>",

    "content": "<p> We get it. You haven&rsquo;t worked on a budget because you had to wash your hair. Feel free to insert your additional excuses here. Budgeting doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you have to spend less. It&rsquo;s about knowing where your money is going, and, knowledge is power. Once you identify your money trail, you will know if you&rsquo;re staying true to your values.  </p><p> We&rsquo;ll make it simple. A very easy way to see if your spending habits are healthy is to take stock of what you&rsquo;re saving. Include savings toward 401(k)&rsquo;s or other employer plans, IRAs, investment accounts, bank savings and/or anywhere else you may be socking money away. If you are saving at least 20% of your after-tax income, then your current spending habits are healthy.  </p><h3> Not saving 20%? </h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t panic. It&rsquo;s just time to take a closer look at how you&rsquo;re spending your money. Consider using an  <u>  expense tracker </u>  to help capture everything.  Or, look into a budgeting tool like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mint  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.quicken.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quicken  </a> </u>  to track and categorize your spending. Then, organize your expenses into two categories:  <strong>  needs </strong>  and  <strong>  wants </strong> . Consider your &ldquo;needs&rdquo; to be expenses that cannot be avoided and are essential to your basic needs.  Everything else is a &ldquo;want.&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re like most people, your allocation towards &ldquo;wants&rdquo; may surprise you and there are likely simple changes that will go a long way. If nothing else, knowing how you have been spending will make you more aware of mindless credit card swipes and your spending habits will start to change. We promise. If you are overspending on needs, it may be that your home is stretching you too thin or private school for the kids might be eating into your retirement nest egg. </p><h3> Saving 20%? </h3><p> <br/> Before enjoying that next splurge, check to see if your cumulative savings is on track. After all, your current spending will not reflect your previous habits but your nest egg will. To see if you&rsquo;re on track (to not have to work forever), refer to the minimum saving targets by age, below.  If your cumulative savings is not on track, work with your financial advisor or use an online calculator to determine how much more you will need to save to catch-up.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"231\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-05-at-9.53.56-AM.png\" width=\"355\"/></p><h3> Saving 20% and the nest egg is on track? </h3><p> <br/> Well done! Just be sure to avoid the sneaky little lifestyle creep we&rsquo;ve talked about. In other words, don&rsquo;t let your lifestyle grow in proportion to your income.

    "title": "Advisors: Stop Writing Marketing Plans",
    "link": "advisors-stop-writing-marketing-plans",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable. </strong> - Dwight D Eisenhower</p><p> Today's message is inspired by a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stage2planning.com/blog/stop-planning-your-life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog post by my friend Josh Patrick  </a> </u>  who reminds us that <strong>  financial plans are not as powerful as we might like to think and that a more productive approach is to frame it as designing a life rather than planning a life. </strong> I won't go into all of the comparisons and benefits that he lays out because what he wrote is excellent and I encourage you to go read it for yourself.</p><p> It reminded me of the revelation I had many years ago when I was doing financial planning full-time that persuaded me to stop thinking of myself so much as a planner but rather as an advisor. Early in my career I was taught that we should draft plans for people and tell them what they needed to do to reach their goals. Over time, I found that telling people what to do has some pretty serious shortcomings. I gradually converted to saying \"I'm not going to tell you what to do. You're a grown-up &ndash; you don't need me to do that. What I can do is to encourage you to think about some issues that I know are important but mostly what I can do for you is to draw on my expertise to help you understand the likely outcomes of the different decisions you could make. You tell me how much you can save, what you would be comfortable with in your portfolio, what provisions you have made for your family in the event something happens to you and other things you might do, and I can tell you how that's likely to affect where you are down the road. If you're not happy with the outcome, I can suggest different decisions you could make now that would affect where you end up. All of the decisions are yours to make.\"</p><p> It was a turning point in my career. It changed my relationship with clients. But it also made it a much better experience for them. And just as Josh discusses the benefits of thinking about it this way in regard to a financial plan, the same is true for marketing plans.</p><p> Part of the futility of drafting detailed plans in my work is that  <u>  referral marketing </u>  as a discrete discipline is such a new idea to most advisors. Many of the ideas and practices I work on with advisors is such a departure from anything they have done before that it is not valuable to plan too much. Like Josh, I make a lot of use of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theclientdrivenpractice.com/storage/Referral%20Marketing%20Strategy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mind maps  </a> </u>  to capture and organize ideas about what outcomes we want and what strategies we will employ to promote an advisor's business. We explore some concepts, try things, get feedback (learn) from the activities, and make changes. It orients us to being flexible. To taking the good ideas, discarding the bad ones, and to keep experimenting. It helps us get to a point where the advisor can stay in a marketing frame of mind &ndash; prepared for the opportunities that arise.</p><p> Consistently trying out referral marketing ideas and staying in that frame of mind gets you in the habit of involving yourself in referral generating activities on an ongoing basis. Of subconsciously asking yourself questions like:</p><li> What's my special value here?</li><li> How is what I'm doing different than other advisors?</li><li> How can I better communicate that?</li><li> What kinds of things to my clients most appreciate?</li><li> What gets people talking about me? <br/>  </li><p> As Josh points out, <strong>  it's not about the plan. </strong> It's not even really about the goals. It's about the trip. Making the most of the journey may help you discover destinations you had not considered but find more appealing. Even if not, it certainly makes getting there a lot more rewarding.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m not interested in preaching the impending advisory Apocalypse. There is and always will be a place for good advice given person-to-person.</p><p> However, when I listen to the voices claiming that online advice, fintech, robo-advice or whatever you want to call it will never catch on, I can&rsquo;t help but hear the emotion of denial, rather than the logic that leads to adaptation.</p><p> I never want to see SME advice businesses squeezed out. Quite the contrary. Our industry without them will be a lesser place. The coaching I do is part of making sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p> No, it&rsquo;s SME advice businesses I want to see building these online offerings. You have the advisory knowledge, client insight and drive to lead the next wave of innovation better than anyone else.</p><p> I would love more advisers to recognise that it&rsquo;s already happening and want to be part of it, rather than resistant to it.</p><p> So, to give you some insight into what others are already doing, I introduce you to three game changers that give you an idea of where thinking around certain transactional financial services is heading:</p><li> <strong>  Open Door </strong>  ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.opendoor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   https://www.opendoor.com/  </a> </u> ) is little more than 12 months old and already it&rsquo;s got the backing of a number of Silicon Valley heavyweights including Google. They aim to liquidify the real estate market and effectively eliminate the need for home sellers to deal with Real Estate Agents. The crux of it is; they use sales data to present a fair price for a home. If the seller accepts the price, they agree a move-out date and provide the cash. They then sell the property on at similarly fair value and take a clip. Basically, a share market for individual properties. Wow. Just wow.</li><li> <strong>  Society One  </strong> ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.societyone.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.societyone.com.au/  </a> </u> ) is not new, but Matt Symons and his team have been diligently trudging through the regulation needed to launch the idea (proof that compliance, regardless of the complexity, should never be a barrier to those with an idea that can genuinely be a game-changer). The basic idea of SocietyOne is peer to peer lending. I&rsquo;ve got $10k savings that the banks won&rsquo;t even give me 5% interest for. Another person needs to borrow $10k that the banks want to slug him or her 20% for. Why not connect the two of us together and meet in the middle at 10%? Even better, why not connect 100 of me and 100 of them together, diversify and reduce the risk massively. SocietyOne is currently only available as an investment vehicle for wholesale investors and to those who want to borrow less than $20k, but watch out banks when approval is given for the rest of us.</li><li> <strong>  Cashwerx </strong>  ( <u>  <a href=\"http://cashwerkz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://cashwerkz.com/  </a> </u> ) has been built on the belief that getting the best deal on Term Deposits and Savings Accounts should be fast and easy. Basically, it offers to scan the market for the best offerings at any time and let you know as soon as you&rsquo;ll get a better deal. In other words, it democratises the process that large financial institutions have been doing for years. Apathy is responsible for thousands of Australians accepting less than optimal returns on their hard earned savings. When the process is automated though, well suddenly we have a far more efficient market on our hands. <br/>  </li><p> There are more, but these are three that spring to mind as demonstrating how technology has the opportunity to change the way consumers engage their financial affairs for the better.</p><p> I guess it boils down to this.  <strong>  As an adviser, if you know that consumers are also embracing new ways of engaging services that have long relied on the middleman, why would you not want to add those services to your offer? Why shouldn&rsquo;t your business launch the next Open Door, SocietyOne or Cashwerx? </strong></p><p> This shouldn&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t mean the end of advisers, anymore than home workouts meant the end of gyms. If anything, it will improve advisers lot on numerous levels, including business efficiency, greater understanding of the value you can add and a host of other benefits.</p><p> Thankfully there are already plenty in our industry already well-progressed in thinking of it this way. I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about the years ahead.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve written quite a lot about my disdain for the use of the word channel, multichannel and omnichannel, and some people asked me: so what should we call it then?  I&rsquo;ve written about this too but, to be exact, we should call it  Access.  Augmented Access, Proximate Access, Intelligent Access  or whatever phrase you want, but it&rsquo;s purely about access to services, information and support in a digital form.</p><p> Access to the banks&rsquo; digital platforms via any form factor I choose &ndash; my mobile, watch, desktop, tablet, car, television or any other form factor I choose.  Access via Skype to a human, via phone to a human or via branch to a human.  Humans who are also being provided access to digital services through the banks&rsquo; platforms.</p><p> In other words, the whole bank sits upon a digital foundation, a digital core, a digital ecosystem.</p><p> In this world, no-one thinks about segregated systems, silo structures or channels.  We don&rsquo;t think:  oh today I&rsquo;m using my mobile channel but tonight I will switch to my call centre channel for service.   We just think:  I&rsquo;m using my banks&rsquo; services.</p><p> In this world, the bank does not think about deploying layers of separated systems and then try to work out how to stitch them all together.  The bank just adds new services and access for new form factors to their digital foundation.</p><p> <strong>  But access is key.  Consistent access to a reliable, resilient, real-time digital service. </strong> <br/> <br/> It is for this reason that I&rsquo;ve kept persisting with the call to replace core systems, because then you can build a reliable structure with data in the cloud and processors for provision of access to the digital core from the ground up.</p><p> What I mean by this is that today, we add channels to old infrastructure and keep therefore adding legacy to legacy.  What we should be doing is replacing the old infrastructure such that it&rsquo;s cleansed and ready for providing access to reliable, resilient, real-time digital services.  Then the future will be adding further access and leveraged service to that digital core.  Adding digital to digital rather than legacy to legacy if you prefer.</p><p> Access.</p><p> I mentioned  Augmented, Proximate and Intelligent Access  because when you have a digital core platform, the information that derives from that platform can be fed to all access points and all form factors.  The intelligent digital bank uses the information from their platforms to populate all access points and all form factors with differentiated service and support.</p><p> Many banks talk about the likes of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google as their aspirational heroes.  What is it about these big internet giants?  Do they have channels?  Do they have segregated structures?  Not at all.  They have a single digital approach to service.  They do not consider mobile, tablet, internet and telephone as separated systems and channels.  They just see access through form factors to their digital services.</p><p> That is the transition banks will go through in the next five years, if they haven&rsquo;t gone through this change process already.  Banks will move from adding legacy to legacy, cementing their back end systems further into place through front-end systems lock in; to building a clean core digital foundation for the bank that can then feed service to any digital or physical form factor where service is needed.</p><p> It will not be an easy transition, but it is a transition demanded if banks are going to be fit for purpose in the digital age. </p>",

    "link": "using-foursquare-swarm-instagram-and-wordswag-to-get-c-level-meetings-socialselling",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In my discussions with Paul  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snapdragon_paul\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @snapdragon_paul  </a> </u>  which became the post  <u>  <a href=\"http://wp.me/p3tudK-dj\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Using Twitter to get C-Level Appointments a Case Study  </a> </u>  there was more material for just one post, so created two blog posts.</p><p> This highly successful blog, has created significant discussion, debate and traffic.  It really &ldquo;blew the notion out of the water&rdquo;, that there is no ROI in Social Selling.  Well worth a read, if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p><p> In this blog I will go through some of the ways Paul is using other forms of Social Media to get C-Level meeting.  (In the previous week to this blog, he made 12 appointments!)</p><h3> Using  <u>  <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Foursquare  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.swarmapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Swarm  </a> </u>  for Prospect Engagement</h3><p> <br/> When I did some training on cold calling the advice was to move the discussion away from a decision on a meeting, yes or no, to an option.  The advice was also to pose a question such as; &ldquo;Can we get together to discuss this?  I&rsquo;m in the area next Tuesday or Thursday, which is better?&rdquo;  Thus moving the emphasis from yes or no to the meeting, making the dilemma over Tuesday or Thursday.</p><p> Foursquare and Swarm let&rsquo;s you &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; to locations, it uses the geo-location functionality of your phone to do this.  Thus you can see where you prospect currently is.  Paul has used this in a number of situations where he has been able to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the area, or just down the road&rsquo; why don&rsquo;t we have a quick 30 minute get together?.</p><p> Note: Swarm is not linked to Klout, (this blog isn&rsquo;t about the the pros and cons of Klout), he is therefore using  <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   If This then That  </u>    </a> (IFTT) to take any Swarm update and post it to  <u>  LinkedIn </u> .  While this is &ldquo;good&rdquo; for his Klout score, it also &ldquo;double dips&rdquo; the information so he is also getting traction / engagement on LinkedIn as well as Swarm.  He gave me an example, where he got a meeting with a Marketing Director where he had posted on Swarm but the post was picked up on LinkedIn..  As many Big Brands are now &ldquo;listening&rdquo; to Social Media, the fact that somebody is checking in with them means (based on your well crafted message) they may want to engage as much as you do.</p><p> Paul is also using Foursquare and Swarm to contact somebody to help him &ldquo;piggy back&rdquo; off that person to get to the true target.</p><h3> Instagram Usage by C-Level People</h3><p> <br/> He and I are not seeing  <a href=\"https://instagram.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Instagram  </u>    </a> being used by C-Level people, but if you find them on there, it is often a good way to listen to somebody or get an understanding of their wants and needs.  For example, they are posting photos of their dog, cats, coffee etc.  More on this in a bit.</p><h3> Riffle GoogleChrome Plug-In</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://crowdriff.com/riffle/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Riffle  </a> </u>  by CrowdRiff teaches you about a prospects Social community.  It&rsquo;s a good way to learn about your prospects to enable you to &ldquo;break the ice&rdquo; it also gives you the top 5 people they interact with, which enables you to build out your network.</p><h3> WordSwag</h3><p> <br/> WordSwag is an App the Paul and I use that allows your to create quotes against a pictorial background.  This type of personalised Micro content is getting Paul a 90% response rate.  An example WordSwag is to the left.  Paul has got inspiration for a WordSwag that he sent over Twitter, based on a contacts interests and posts on Instagram.  For example, Paul tells me how he researched a senior influencer, nobody had been able to track the person down on email or the phone.

    "content": "<p> The attack on advisory fees has been rampant&hellip;and it&rsquo;s escalating. Some say you charge too much. Others think advice should be free (or close to it).  And still more want you to feel guilty for making a great living.Bupkis!!!You save your clients tons of money.  You keep them out of trouble.  You give them a shoulder to lean on.  And you help them accomplish lifelong goals. Unfortunately, the crooks, criminals and rogue advisors have painted you with an unflattering shade of gray.</p><h3> And people who should know better can&rsquo;t tell the difference.</h3>There are a boatload of industry watchers who don&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t appreciate the power of professional advice. They confuse price and pricing mechanisms (fees vs. commissions) with the sanity that you bring to an insane world.<h3> Sound dramatic?  It&rsquo;s not.</h3>Financial advisors&hellip;real, true blue advisors are worth their weight in gold.

They value algorithms and killer apps more than human intelligence and interaction.  That&rsquo;s nuts!<h3> What&rsquo;s worse?  Some of you are buckling.</h3>You are discounting your fees with the &ldquo;expectation&rdquo; that clients or future clients (i.e. prospects) expect to pay less.  This is like arguing against yourself.

    "link": "how-to-thrive-against-giants",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When you know that your company will never be the low-cost producer nor will it ever have enough cash to outspend the big cat, there&rsquo;s no choice but to find other ways to skin that cat. Thousands of small to medium sized businesses are successfully doing this. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; you ask. The answer lies within those factors that do not require fat bank accounts. There are far more than you think.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll start with leadership. A good CEO costs no more than a bad one &ndash; sometimes far less when you consider costly mistakes and lucrative severance packages. The same argument can be made for strategies. The very best strategies aren&rsquo;t generated by outside strategic planning consultants who bill thousands of dollars a day. These strategies come from the inquisitive mindsets of founders, entrepreneurs, and employees who are keen to make a difference. </p><h3> Culture Separates Winners from Losers</h3><p> <br/> The path upon which I am walking is the one paved by powerful corporate cultures and shared employee  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cliffsnotes.com/sciences/sociology/culture-and-societies/cultural-values\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   values  </a> </u> . More than ever before, cultural strength is separating winners from losers. That said, a culture that works for one company might be the kiss of death in another.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mon/financials\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Monsanto  </a> </u> , for example, enjoys the competitive advantage that emanates from a culture of clout. The power they exert from impregnable patents and scale economies is providing unprecedented sales and earnings growth. Clout companies favor acquiring competitors, entering new product or service categories, and expanding into virgin geographies. Ultimately, sales per employee decline as acquisitions are digested, plants are closed, and employees are terminated. </p><p> So how does a small player compete against mega corporations? Rule number one: don&rsquo;t try to copy the giant&rsquo;s strategy or its culture. There might be elements that are worth emulating, but certainly not the ethic of dominance, because by their very nature, small and medium sized operations have no clout. That doesn&rsquo;t meant they can&rsquo;t be strategically powerful. Specialization is the key to thriving against mega corporations with broad scope &ndash; generalists the likes of Walmart, Kraft, and Google. In America, several specialist retailers who limit their product scope continue to thrive in an environment dominated by 5,000  <u>  <a href=\"http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-business/locations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wal-Mart  </a> </u>  stores.   </p><h3> Stop Trying to Do More and More; Do Less, Better</h3><p> <br/> When an organization enjoys &ldquo;big company&rdquo; power, a qualitative culture isn&rsquo;t urgent. Qualitative cultures are about the creativity, the ingenuity, and the innovation created by the human resource, not the financial resource. But to smaller companies, qualitative strategies are the catalyst to sustainable competitive advantage. This is a culture of entrepreneurial and innovative thinking. Make the right move, shatter market paradigms, and competitors will follow, no matter their size. And while they are scrambling to catch up, you can be working on the next move to alter the strategic game. This type of culture emanates from the top and permeates every nook and cranny of the operation. The leader cannot do it alone. He or she needs other leaders, and they are everywhere, waiting to be unleashed.</p><p> With the right headset, there is no reason why a smaller player cannot challenge a giant&rsquo;s wallop and become a leader within its chosen market. The trick to thriving against the Giants comes down to  <strong>  doing less, better </strong>  with an arsenal of three weapons&mdash; leadership, strategy, and culture. Here are 7 cultural traits that help smaller players thrive in a business world in which big keeps getting bigger:  </p><li> The big guys are slow.  <strong>  Hustle. </strong></li><li> They are bureaucratic.  <strong>  Be nimble. </strong></li><li> They are risk averse.  <strong>  Think and act entrepreneurially. </strong></li><li> They are generalists.  <strong>  Be a specialist or organize the company to act like one. </strong></li><li> They are obsessed with scale.  <strong>  Be obsessed with creativity and innovation. </strong></li><li> They are fact-centric; the more data at their disposal, the better.  <strong>  Be fact-selective.  </strong></li><li> They grow by doing more and more. <strong>     <strong>   Grow by doing less, better.  </strong> </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> The Law of the Vital Few</h3><p> <br/> At the core of  <strong>  doing less, better </strong>  is  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\" target=\"_blank\">   Pareto&rsquo;s Principle  </a> </u> , the 80/20 rule, known as the law of the vital few. The principle is more than a century old and is rooted in Vilfredo Pareto&rsquo;s simple observation that 20% of the pea pods in his garden contained 80% of the peas. This led to a more profound assertion by Pareto&mdash;that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.  You&rsquo;ve likely heard this expression in business as it applies to sales, profits, and customers. Generally speaking, 20% of the new initiatives deliver 80% of the rewards. Choose carefully, and you save money, reduce complexity, and ride the fastest race horses to the future.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There is a critical gap with financial advisors understanding the difference between continuity, contingency, and succession plans. Most advisors tend to fuse them together and miss the value a continuity plan provides.</p><p> In the case of a tragic event, failing to plan may be planning to fail. As a financial advisor, you need to ask yourself a series of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; and &ldquo;what will happen&rdquo; questions:</p><li> What if I can&rsquo;t return to work tomorrow &ndash; either temporarily or permanently?</li><li> What will happen to my clients?</li><li> What will happen to my team?</li><li> What if my business isn&rsquo;t marketable? <br/>  </li><p> Most advisors have these questions scattered in the back of their mind and know it is important, but often a formal plan is put on the back burner. If you don&rsquo;t answer these questions, who will be there to answer them for you? Will it be a grieving spouse or family member, team members, your clients?</p><h3> The Difference Between Continuity, Contingency, and Succession Planning</h3><p> <br/> All financial advisors should have continuity, contingency, and succession plans in place.</p><li> A  <strong>  continuity plan </strong>  is a process that can be implemented immediately due to any unexpected disruption in your ability to work &ndash; either temporarily or permanently.</li><li> A  <strong>  contingency plan </strong>  is a process that will be implemented due to a disaster; a tornado, hurricane, flood, or fire. Keep in mind, you, the advisor, are present and able to lead the team and answer client questions.</li><li> A  <strong>  succession plan </strong>  is a process that will take place over a period of time prior to a planned exit from your firm, such as your retirement. <br/>  </li><h3> How Continuity Plans Protect the Value of Your Firm</h3><p> <br/> Continuity planning plays a valuable part in protecting the value of your firm. Ask yourself these questions:</p><li> How likely is it to retain skilled team members if they are unsure what will happen to their position should something happen to you?</li><li> How likely is it to retain current assets, capture new assets, and referrals if clients are uneasy about your likely retirement? <br/>  </li><p> Studies show that clients are likely to choose a new advisor and are hesitant to provide referrals as they see their advisor nearing retirement or becoming disabled. Retain your clients and firm value by communicating your continuity plan. When clients have a clear understanding of who will manage their portfolio and answer their questions, they feel reassured that they will be cared for in the event of your unexpected absence.</p><h3> Make it Simple and Put a Plan in Place</h3><p> <br/> A continuity plan should be part of your overall business plan. A study conducted by  <u>  Pershing </u> , <u>  ReGENeration: How Gen Y Could Revitalize the Industry &ndash; and Bring New Life to Your Firm </u> , tells us that it takes an average of 11 years for your associate advisor or next person in line to be up and running as efficiently as you are. The readiness gap is too large. As an advisor, you need to ensure proper training is put in place to close the gap or position a continuity partner that has the ability to step in now.</p><p> Here are a few tips to put your plan in place:</p><li> <strong>  Name a Continuity Partner: </strong>  Choose an advisor that is compatible with your firm and has the ability to step in at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</li><li> <strong>  Include a Time Frame: </strong>  Determine the duration of your continuity plan depending on the circumstance.</li><li> <strong>  Inform Your Broker/Dealer: </strong>  Provide guidance to your broker/dealer with a copy of your continuity plan.</li><li> <strong>  Inform Family, Team Members, and Clients: </strong>  Communicate the process with your family, team members, and clients. </li><li> <strong>  Address Your Succession Plan: </strong>  Review your succession plan with your continuity partner and other key personnel. <br/>  </li><p> As a financial advisor, you have the responsibility to provide direction to your family, team, and clients. Take time to prepare yourself in order to make necessary and rational decisions.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Several new books are pertinent to topics frequently covered by this blog. Three worth noting are about low-income savers, older workers, and small employers with retirement plans that are overdue for an upgrade.</p><p> Here are brief descriptions:</p><li> &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://emergencysavings.org/book/contents/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A Fragile Balance  </a> </u> : Emergency Savings and Liquid Resources for Low-Income Consumers:&rdquo;:</li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-05-at-11.27.41-AM.png\" width=\"221\"/></p><p> <br/> For low-wage workers in fast food, retail, and similar jobs, just finding enough money for living expenses is like squeezing blood from a turnip. Research shows that many want to save, and the absence of this backstop only increases their financial fragility. The default is often to resort to high-cost debt, which further confounds their ability to pay the bills, much less weather the next emergency such as a car repair.</p><p> Finding effective savings interventions to help low-wage workers may be the toughest personal finance challenge there is. It&rsquo;s also the mission of the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and its director, J. Michael Collins. In this volume, edited by Collins, leading researchers review various interventions and policies &ndash; from mortgage reserve accounts and impulse saving to programs that encourage low-income workers to save their  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/research/extra-in-refund-checks-spurs-savings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tax refunds  </a> </u> .

He just tells good stories &ndash; about a 90-year-old parking attendant at a California hospital, a 62-year-old Ohioan working for an agency that helps other low-income seniors like herself find work, or a very relieved 57-year-old Illinois man who finally landed a sales job after three years of unemployment.</p><p> The author takes readers overseas to describe the challenges of Europe&rsquo;s graying population and to meet Japanese women in an aging town who earn income by picking flowers, herbs and garnishes for sale. The author also explores Sweden&rsquo;s employer-union-government support system for laid-off workers searching for a new job &ndash; a sharp contrast to our sink or swim prescription for older workers in this country.</p><li> &ldquo;Simple Steps to Success:&rdquo;</li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-05-at-11.26.49-AM.png\" width=\"287\"/></p><p> <br/> To help small companies improve their employees&rsquo; retirement security, financial adviser Mark Zoril has written an e-book and is making it available  <u>  here </u>  briefly for free. Unlike major corporations, he writes, firms with fewer than 500 workers often do not have an employee whose sole job is managing the retirement plan. He has seen first-hand how an understandable lack of expertise and resources can lead to excessive fees.</p><p> Although Zoril wrote the book to promote his Minneapolis company, he said most small employers need to do the same things to minimize fees, which employees typically pay out of their investment portfolios. First, put the retirement plan business out for bid so companies compete for it &ndash; small firms often fail to shop around. Second, avoid paying fees for recordkeeping and investment services that are calculated as a percentage of plan assets &ndash; the dollar fees increase as plan assets grow. Instead, hire service providers, such as recordkeepers, on a flat-fee basis for each service provided. Finally, invest in low-cost index funds or exchange traded funds. Zoril said most plans should aim for reducing their fees to one-half of 1 percentage point per participant.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Sun Tzu stated, \"Every battle is won before it is ever fought.\" <strong>  The same holds true when ordering wine. </strong> How good is the restaurant's wine program to begin with? How well is their wine stored? Is the staff properly trained? Once you stack the odds in your favor by going to the right restaurant, you can hazard yourself a glass of wine. Speaking of glasses, I always appreciate when a restaurant has good stemware, doesn't serve their by-the-glass reds too warm, and presents wines-by-the-glass as well as those by the bottle. </p><p> <strong>  The tasting ritual begins when you are presented with a wine list </strong> , which hopefully, doesn't look like the <i>  Magna Carta </i> . Unlike buying batteries from <i>  Radio Shack </i> (no, I don't want to give you my address and phone number), it should be a simple transaction. The first way a restaurant can screw this up is by telling you that they are sold out of a particular wine after you order it. A close second is when the server doesn't recognize their own wines by name (please do not oblige me to order wines by number). What amazes me is how quickly you are expected to make a selection from a potentially enormous wine book. How's that fine print in the dim light working out for you? Please do not hover, badger, or otherwise annoy me while I'm making my selection. I'm merely mustering the courage to buy a bottle at four times the retail price!</p><p> When a wine is presented to me, I like to nonchalantly touch the bottle in order to check the temperature of the wine. Is the bottle cool to the touch? If so, great! If not, it probably means that the bottle wasn't pulled from a temperature-controlled cellar. Try to identify the bottle as quickly as possible. Take enough time to identify it properly, but not long enough for Stockholm Syndrome to set in--either it is the bottle you ordered or it isn't. </p><h3> Next comes the opening.</h3><p> <br/> There are few things more uncomfortable than watching a seventeen- year-old server awkwardly open an expensive bottle of wine in the air. Seriously, I'm OK with you placing it on the table! And now for my favorite part, the ubiquitous presentation of the cork. Yes, I concur...it's a cork! I've found that the best way to handle this is by picking it up and giving it a quick squeeze. The end that was in contact with the wine should be moist and spongy. If it is rock-hard and, or cracked, a quick smell may be warranted. A quick smell...we haven't entered a cork-sniffing competition! The only thing we are looking for is an off-smell such as sulfur, etc. </p><h3> Next comes the initial pour.</h3><p> <br/> If you don't know why you are swirling the wine, please don't! If you do, please limit yourself to a couple of quick table swirls. Here's where I deviate from the average taster. I stick my nose in the glass briefly and give it a quick smell without tasting it. It's pass/fail...do you need to taste milk to know that it has gone sour? It is important to note that you are not judging the wine. You ordered it, you own it! If it isn't spoiled, the winery, distributor, and restaurant have all done their jobs. The onus for the selection is on you! Please do not hold the server hostage while you do your best Anton Ego impression. A mere, \"It's fine, thank you\" will suffice. </p><p> What if it isn't fine? If there is something wrong with the wine other than you not liking it, you could say something like, \"I'm sorry, but I think something is wrong with this. Would you please taste it?\" The most common culprit is TCA or trichloroanisole, a naturally occurring problem that takes place during bottling. It's the actual term for a wine that is \"corked.\" </p><p> If all goes well, the server will finish pouring the wine. How much they pour will depend on the establishment. For some reason, steakhouses are notorious for intemperate pours. Servers donning lab coats in steakhouses across America seem intent on emptying entire bottles of wine in three or less pours in a shameless attempt to get you to buy more wine. If your waiter is dressed like a pharmacist...run!  </p><h3> A word on decanting:</h3><p> <br/> Young, austere, or tannic wines can benefit from decanting. Older wines throwing off sediment can also benefit from decanting. Just bear in mind that wines need aeration, not oxidation. An overzealous penchant for decanting can render a delicate wine insipid. I'm assuming, of course, that we are talking about a clean container. A dirty container can taint wine irrespective of the wine's quality. Because of their narrow openings, decanters are inherently difficult to clean. Frankly, restaurant decanters scare the hell out of me. They can harbor anything from wine residue to harmful bacteria. </p><p> While it is agreed that these measures won't solve the world's problems, they will make for an improved wine experience. Wine service engenders a symbiotic relationship between the server and the customer. When everyone does their part, the potential for peevish success exists! </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Your nonverbal communication is between 60-93% of your total communication. It's essential that your nonverbal communication is spot on if you want to sell something effectively, so make sure you don&rsquo;t commit any of these 5 blunders!</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-Nonverbal-Blunders-to-Avoid.png\" width=\"930\"/> </a></p><h3> #1 Too much/too little eye contact</h3><p> <br/> People hold eye contact for 60-70% of the time in a normal conversation. By having eye contact you show that you&rsquo;re listening and that you understand the other person. When your eye contact drops below 60%, people will consider you uninterested or inattentive. This, of course, is not the message that you want to convey when you&rsquo;re trying to build rapport to sell something.</p><p> On the other hand, you shouldn&rsquo;t be making too much eye contact either. Making too much eye contact can make you seem creepy and make the other person feel uneasy. Instead, stay in the ideal range of 60-70%.</p><h3> #2 Mismatches</h3><p> <br/> A mismatch happens when you&rsquo;re saying A and nonverbally showing B. You could, for example, nod while saying no. Even if your words are extremely convincing, if you&rsquo;re fidgeting or not making enough eye contact, a prospect won&rsquo;t buy from you because your verbal and nonverbal aren&rsquo;t congruent.</p><h3> #3 Bad handshake</h3><p> <br/> A solid handshake is a very important part of a conversation. Research has shown that a handshake is worth up to 3 hours of face-to-face time! This means it&rsquo;s very important that you have the handshake nailed, so you&rsquo;re able to build connection with that individual. The right way to do it is by holding your hand in a vertical position, making eye contact and applying as much pressure as the person you&rsquo;re meeting.</p><p> Applying too much pressure in a handshake will anger other people or make them uneasy. They may consider you dominant or too aggressive by your strong grip. Similarly, a grip that&rsquo;s not strong enough should be avoided. People may think that you don&rsquo;t have any spine or character.</p><p> Unsure about your handshake? Practice with a trusted coworker or friend and give each other honest feedback.</p><h3> #4 Fidgeting</h3><p> <br/> Whether you&rsquo;re playing with a pen, adjusting your hair or shuffling your papers, fidgeting is a big no-no. By doing this, you&rsquo;re nonverbally showing that you&rsquo;re not entirely comfortable. How is a potentially already unsure prospect going to buy from you if you&rsquo;re not showing confidence? The prospect will wonder what exactly you&rsquo;re uncertain about: your sales pitch, the product, the service, or yourself?</p><h3> #5 Too much nodding</h3><p> <br/> When the client or prospect is talking, you  want to nod along every once in a while to show you&rsquo;re engaged and interested. This is something we do automatically to show we&rsquo;re listening. Some people nod too much though. They will almost start to resemble one of those dashboard dogs or bobbleheads who just keep nodding. You don&rsquo;t want to be that person who is always nodding &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. People may think you&rsquo;re making fun of them or that you&rsquo;re in a hurry. As with all things body language related, nodding falls on a spectrum; make sure you&rsquo;re not doing it too much or too little.</p><p> <strong>  Ninja tip: </strong> nod three times slowly when the other person is talking. This is the nonverbal signal for &ldquo;keep going&rdquo;. By doing this, you can get them to tell you 3-4 times more than they normally would. And by getting that extra information or those extra answers, you can serve your client or prospect better!</p>",

    "content": "<p> As we&rsquo;ve discussed, your company&rsquo;s diversity and inclusion initiatives need to be sustainable efforts in order to be successful. You might be asking &ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s in it for my company?&rdquo; The answer is simple, and it&rsquo;s become our mantra: inclusion is a business imperative.</p><p> In her article &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/28/three-questions-every-organization-should-ask-about-diversity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Three questions every organization should ask about diversity  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; Shellye Archambeau, CEO of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.metricstream.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MetricStream  </a> </u> , reveals that companies committing to increasing their diversity and inclusion efforts are &ldquo;35% more likely to gain above-average financial returns.&rdquo;</p><p> Taking this a step further, Archambeau said that in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u>  survey of 321 of the largest companies across the world, 85 percent of those responding agreed &ldquo;that diversity is crucial to fostering innovation in the workplace.&rdquo;</p><p> Although these statistics build a pretty strong case for having a sustainable diversity and inclusion program in your workplace, it can be difficult to know where to begin. Archambeau posed three questions in her article that may be helpful in evaluating your current situation; these questions can also be used to conduct check-ups on your efforts over time.</p><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Is the organization, in general and at the leadership level, diverse?&rdquo; </strong>  Take a look at who makes up your office. Do you see a variety of people, or do they look the same? We all know diversity isn&rsquo;t just limited to race and gender, so consider whether your organization is comprised of a wide range of backgrounds, diverse ideas and perspectives. It&rsquo;s also important to look at the diversity of leadership. If all leaders are white, middle class men, this might be an area to improve upon.  </li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Is a wide net being cast for talent?&rdquo; </strong>  The answer to this question depends on your answer to question one. If you look around and don&rsquo;t see a lot of diversity, chances are your talent net is not wide enough. As Archambeau says, &ldquo;Finding potential employees who differ from a gender, ethnic or nationality perspective requires looking beyond your traditional networks.&rdquo; It may take extra effort to find diverse talent, but keep in mind that inclusion impacts your bottom line. Taking extra time to find a great employee will be worth it. But remember to ensure that your employees match your market&mdash;focus on  <a href=\"http://www.inclusion-inc.com/blog/2013/07/15/98/are_you_paying_attention_to_kedrg/#.VUPg-yFViko\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   key employee demographics required for growth  </u>  . </a></li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Have you created an environment to support diversity?&rdquo; </strong>  This question comes down to the culture of your company. Have you fostered an environment that is warm toward and welcoming of differences and diversity? Do you encourage inclusion and continue the conversation of diversity through training opportunities? Though all three questions are important, this last question might be the most important in terms of sustaining diversity in your workplace. If the culture you create isn&rsquo;t welcoming and inclusive of diversity, you probably won&rsquo;t retain quality employees who are different. <br/>  </li><p> With these questions in mind, it&rsquo;s time to be proactive. Take steps to ensure you are building a sustainable environment where inclusion will thrive. Be inclusive! </p>",

    "content": "<p> Rossi Navi&rsquo;s Viarregio, Italy shipyard delivered a most distinguished design in the Ketos, or &ldquo;great fish,&rdquo; hull series, with the 39m/127.95ft Vellmari. Striking vertical windows intimate floor to ceiling gills in a dramatic sweep of style from Arrabito Naval Architects and Enrico Gobbi&rsquo;s Team 4 Design group. This chic ship embraces luxury, inviting the full comforts of 10 guests in five staterooms and five crew in three cabins.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"363\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-06-at-8.19.47-AM.png\" width=\"536\"/></p><p> Vellmari&rsquo;s exterior is handsome, aggressive, and sleek, with a graphic design style that suggests its supremely chic interior. Emphatic in her invitation to drink in the panoramic views through her vast, wrapping windows, Vellmari calls her guests to appreciate her design in tandem with nature&rsquo;s most beautiful horizons. Cherry woods, creamy leathers, and light, lush carpets find glass and chrome accents with attention to fine craftsmanship. Recessed deck heads adorned with fiber optic stars offer an evening ambiance honoring nature&rsquo;s celestial show.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"363\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-06-at-8.19.52-AM.png\" width=\"536\"/></p><p> The sumptuous sky lounge features a removable hard top along with protection from four retractable window sections to allow use in a broad variety of weather conditions. Similarly, a circular Jacuzzi encircled by moveable glass panels allows all-weather enjoyment of the spa. Electronically controlled, these panels ensure protection and views regardless of outdoor conditions. Beautifully appointed bar, dining for 12, and sun pads join the arrangement, making the deck a focal point for entertaining.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"363\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-06-at-8.19.55-AM.png\" width=\"537\"/></p><p> The exquisite full beam owner&rsquo;s suite on the main deck is naturally lit by two-meter tall windows, creating a unique perspective from both inside and out. Tasteful graphics and luscious fabrics throughout the suite are echoed in the additional full beam VIP master suite on the lower deck, as well as the additional guest suites. Crystal, precious glass, Murano style Venetian glass handcrafts, and superior textiles complete the guest quarters in perfect complement to Vellmari&rsquo;s overall design.</p><p> Vellmari&rsquo;s design team equipped her with Humphree Interceptors for improved trim at sea, powered to speed through the waters at 17.5 kts. by two 2,600 HP diesels with twin screw props. Modern, sleek, and performance-oriented, Motor Yacht Vellmari presents an experience that defines Italian chic, while nestling guests in luxurious comfort. </p>",

    "title": "7 Truths of the Encounter Economy",
    "link": "7-truths-of-the-encounter-economy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromtherooftops\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Scott Davis  </a> </u>  </p><p> As I explained in the recent post,  <u>  The Encounter Economy Has Arrived </u> , we&rsquo;ve entered an era where consistent value delivery is not enough for a business to succeed anymore. Where even the happiest customers bounce from one great experience to the next, maybe to never return. In this world, you have to make sure every touchpoint is a powerful standalone encounter &ldquo;for the ages.&rdquo; The following truths of the Encounter Economy will spell doom for some businesses, while others will thrive. Let them be a guide for your brand and seize this opportunity to capture hearts (and the wallets attached to them).</p><h3> #1: The Internet is a giant trampoline</h3><p> Bounce, bounce, bounce. Ever been to one of those warehouses that&rsquo;s wall-to-wall trampoline? Yeah, the Internet is just like that. Bouncing, flipping, pretending you can dunk a basketball. All really fun! And then you try to stand still or walk a straight line, and it&rsquo;s nearly impossible. How many times have you opened your browser with purpose, only to get distracted before even completing the task at hand? Happens to me A LOT. Sometimes I make it to the right place but then another tab calls my name and boom, I&rsquo;m gone. Your customer or prospect is doing the same thing.</p><h3> #2: It is OK to ignore your competitors so long as you know you&rsquo;re competing</h3><p> Competitive landscape research is a tried and true technique in the world of marketing strategy. It is smart, after all, to have a sense of what the companies in your industry are up to. But it can also be a recipe for boring (aka disaster). So what if you ignore them? The reality is that you are competing, but that your competitive set is far broader than just those companies who offer comparable products or services. You are competing for time and limited attention spans. You&rsquo;re competing with your closest competitor but also with  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=cute+kittens&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1278&amp;bih=592&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IiFJVcezGMv7sAWIroDACA&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ\" target=\"_blank\">   cute kitten photos  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Funny or Die  </a> </u>  clips because your target customer is just as distracted as the rest of us. And if you embrace Truth #5 below, then you&rsquo;ll likely be doing things so differently from your competitor that you can ignore them completely. Just don&rsquo;t think you have no competition.</p><br /><h3> #3: Your analytics are playing you for a fool</h3><p> As modern day marketers, we have so much data at our fingertips. And it&rsquo;s the kind of data we could only dream of having just a few short years ago. But you seriously need to look your tools in the eye with your most threatening face and tell them to STFU for a minute. You are not (necessarily) winning because you brought your bounce rate down and increased time on site. The Analytics trap is a dirty one because it takes data that might mean something and makes us think it DEFINITELY means something. But sometimes, a single 90-second experience with no obvious &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; might be the biggest win of all.</p><br /><h3> #4: Agile consumer insights are critical</h3><p> Knock your socks off encounters are made possible when a great idea builds on a deep insight. But with the pace of change and the steady flow of opportunity, you need to stay on top of your audience and their shifting perceptions and attitudes. Harness your tools, databases and chance encounters to keep refining your understanding of your consumer and evolving your experiences to align.</p><h3> #5: Consumer value creation doesn&rsquo;t have to directly relate to your actual &ldquo;business&rdquo;</h3><p> One of the easiest ways to surprise and delight your customers is to give them something of value that is unrelated to what you&rsquo;re selling. Google gives you amazing (and free) search tools and makes their money in advertising. Musicians give you recorded music for free or cheap and make their money on the road. We pour  <u>  free coffee </u>  and host events, and make our money from clients who align with our passion for creating meaningful brand encounters. The point is to delight them by any means necessary, and start a relationship that could eventually translate into sales and advocacy.</p><h3> #6: Consistency is King maybe a Jack</h3><p> For too long now, brand strategy has focused on delivering a consistent experience across all your touchpoints. But when you try to deliver the same experience every time (even if it&rsquo;s a great one) don&rsquo;t you inherently create a status quo that eliminates the opportunity for the magic moments that will put your business over the top? Consistency should be your foundation, but you have to build from there.</p><br /><h3> #7: Love is the killer app</h3><p> Admittedly, I&rsquo;ve wanted to use this line ever since I first read Tim Sanders&rsquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781400046836-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   book  </a> </u>  of the same name. But in the Encounter Economy, it&rsquo;s probably the most critical truth of all. You&rsquo;ve got to feel (and share) true love for your customers and community. When you operate from a place of love, you&rsquo;re more generous. You&rsquo;re also more attractive because you&rsquo;re happy and genuine and all, you know, googly. Amazing encounters are birthed from, and result in, deep feelings of love.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Tax time is over and you SWEAR it won&rsquo;t be like this again.</p><p> Boxes, files and receipts everywhere&mdash;it looks like a paper bomb went off. But every bit as annoying as the mess is the confusion about what to keep, what to toss and what to do with all of it.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s time to tame the beast.</h3><p> <br/> Or float him down the river on RAFT&mdash;the system I recommend to control the clutter of financial information that invades every corner of your life. RAFT&mdash;refer, act, file, toss&mdash;is a quick triage system to make sure you put your focus only on what truly matters.</p><p> <strong>  Refer: </strong>  This is the hot button&mdash;the things that need immediate tending to, usually by a specialist of some sort. If there is some sort of actual or potential legal action against you or your financial relationships, you need to contact your attorney and insurance carrier. A notice from the IRS should be dealt with by calling your CPA to make sure the notice is handled correctly and on time. Even if you are a die-hard do-it-yourselfer, there will be times when you need to cough up the dough and get help from someone who knows more than you&hellip;</p><p> Digression Alert: My father was the ultimate DIY&rsquo;er. He was meticulous in his scraping, burning, preparing and painting multiple coats on each shingle and shake, but it took him an entire year to do each side of the house. By the time the house was completed on all sides, it was time to start again. Sensible? Nah&hellip; </p><p> <strong>  Act: </strong>  These items require you to take action&mdash;filling out a form, making a phone call, reviewing information. They might include a notice from your health insurance carrier that your claim is in dispute. Or perhaps while reviewing your investment statement you see a purchase or sale or some other transaction that you don&rsquo;t remember authorizing. When you receive an Anniversary statement from a life insurance policy, you should review it immediately and match it against the expectations provided by your agent. If there are discrepancies, call your agent and find out why.</p><p> <strong>  File: </strong>  File all tax related items&mdash;your Federal and state returns, W-2 forms, 1099&rsquo;s&mdash;and supporting documentation and keep them for at least three years. Before you chuck those papers, check the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/How-long-should-I-keep-records\" target=\"_blank\">   IRS website  </a> </u>  for the circumstances when you need to keep returns longer. Set up a permanent insurance file for your Anniversary statements and renewed policies. Review and then file your year-end investment statements, bank statements etc. Download statements and policies directly where possible and scan everything else if you want to keep actual paper to a bare minimum. Just be sure to save them in a folder on your computer and keep a backup on a secure flash drive and/or your cloud.</p><p> <strong>  Toss: </strong>  Anything that smells of advertising and solicitations earns the right to enter your recycling bin.  Interim investment statements should be reviewed and then shredded. The same goes for Annual Reports, Semi-Annual Reports and prospectuses; by all means, take a gander, review it, use it to read when you&rsquo;re having trouble sleeping and then dump it. And there&rsquo;s no reason to keep paper copies of your credit card statements after you&rsquo;ve reviewed them, although you might want to keep a scanned copy of the annual summary.</p><p> The key to making RAFT work for you is&mdash;like most successful systems&mdash;to work it daily. The mail (snail and e) comes in, you sort by category and you know AND TAKE the appropriate action.</p><p> If the idea of &ldquo;tossing&rdquo; is monumentally difficult (throwing something away is so&hellip;so&hellip;.so permanent!), learn to take a deep breath, release your inner hoarder and say buh bye to stuff you don&rsquo;t need.</p><p> Getting your financial life organized is about taking control. About improving your comfort with your money. And having more time on your hands to say, paint the house&hellip;</p>",

One of two things inevitably happens; you make a decision, or you do nothing and let things fall where they may, which is ultimately a decision too. Still, along the way, it&rsquo;s a painful process filled with made up stories in lieu of the certainty.</p><p> Speaking of certainty, tell me I&rsquo;m not alone occasionally wishing I had a crystal ball to show me I&rsquo;m making the right choice. I&rsquo;m not talking about a Magic 8 Ball either, flipping it over and over until you get the answer you want. Instead, I&rsquo;d love to gaze into the crystal ball and know that  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-beyond-illusion-of-perfection/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   everything will be perfect  </a> </u> . </p><p> Would you look in the ball? Don&rsquo;t you want to know that your book will become a bestseller, you&rsquo;ll be oh-so-much happier at the new company, or your new business will be amazingly profitable within 12 months? What&rsquo;s the alternative? Leaping into the unknown? (um, yeah.) </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Part+of+the+adventure+is+not+knowing+how+the+story+ends&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/4-ways-to-overcome-indecision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Part of the adventure is not knowing how the story ends  </a> </u></p><p> I have a friend, Mike, who hates Tuesdays because that&rsquo;s the day he has to get on a plane each week and travel for work. He hugs his kids and wife goodbye and goes to places like Ohio and Upstate NY (are you jealous?). For as long as I&rsquo;ve known him, he says he wants to quit his job and go to  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/dreams-are-not-reality-until-you-make-them-come-true/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   work on a long-held dream  </a> </u> , but with every mortgage payment he lets go of his dream a little more.  </p><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; my Mike told me the last time we caught up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this field forever; I can&rsquo;t start over now.&rdquo; After that, he continued talking for at least 10 minutes, more to himself than to me, to justify his choice. I listened, nodded, and when he finally took a breath, I told him the one thing he probably didn&rsquo;t want to hear, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a load of crap.&rdquo;  </p><p> He knows the choice in front of him; it&rsquo;s crystal clear. He&rsquo;s stuck.</p><h3> 4 States of Stuck</h3><p> <br/> Take a look at the chart below. Like my friend Mike, think about that &ldquo;thing&rdquo; you want to do.

You likely feel a little sore and it tells you that you&rsquo;re pushing yourself and growing strength. The reason you feel the &ldquo;good pain&rdquo; is that you stretched yourself but didn&rsquo;t go too far in any one session. You gave yourself time to build instead of break.  </p><p> <strong>  Remember: </strong></p><li> Don&rsquo;t be afraid of discomfort &ndash; it&rsquo;s a sign of growing strength.</li><li> Push yourself past your comfort zone, but not so far you can&rsquo;t recover.</li><li> Hard work daily becomes satisfying when you start to see results. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Do This to Overcome Indecision and Find Your Next Step: </strong></p><li> Break down your big goal that feels too difficult into smaller steps.</li><li> Set interim goals to give yourself milestones to celebrate along the way.</li><li> Get started. An object in motion stays in motion and an object in rest, stays stuck. I mean, at rest&hellip; <br/>  </li><h3> I Know What to Do, but It&rsquo;s Risky</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Feeling uncomfortable is not a sign something is impossible.   </strong></p><p> Moving from Washington DC to the Australian Outback was a risk. For a while, I was caught in a mental shouting match between a passion for travel and adventure and my desire to live a future that felt more familiar. When asked what I would do if I hated living in the Outback, the answer was simple. I&rsquo;ll come home&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t plan to hate it. I embraced the change, believed it would be great, and was right.  </p><p> <strong>  Remember:   </strong></p><li> Rarely are  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/decision-time-move-forward-or-change-course/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our decisions irreversible  </a> </u>  or permanent.</li><li> Success never happens in a straight line, expect some messiness.</li><li> Control and predictability are illusions, even if you do nothing new. </li><p> <strong>  Do This to Overcome Indecision and Find Your Next Step: </strong></p><li> Admit that you&rsquo;re afraid instead of  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/30-excuses-to-kick-to-the-curb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   buying into your excuses  </a> </u> .</li><li> Step up into your vulnerability. Yes, it&rsquo;s scary, but it&rsquo;s also human.</li><li> Close your eyes and let yourself picture a time that you felt your most confident and centered. Explore the scene in your mind&rsquo;s eye and allow yourself to embody that moment and feeling as you step forward. </li><p> <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/a-new-path-e1430700383779.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Overcome Indecision and step into the mystery of following a new path\" src=\"http://breaktheframe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/a-new-path-e1430700383779.jpg\"/> </a></p><h3> I Don&rsquo;t Know What I Want to Do</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  There is nothing to discover if everything is already known. </strong>   </p><p> When I was in college, I majored in sociology, moved into business, became a change practitioner and discovered that when I think I know what&rsquo;s next, I&rsquo;m usually wrong. When my well-meaning friend, Ken, told me he thought I&rsquo;d never leave Philadelphia, I don&rsquo;t think either one of us imagined I&rsquo;d someday be living in the Australian Outback. Every new path your follow is a mystery &ndash; especially if it&rsquo;s one you&rsquo;ve never walked before. Nothing is certain. Not success, not failure, not joy not sorrow. It&rsquo;s all a grab bag. Move anyway. </p><p> <strong>  Remember:   </strong></p><li> Every road leads somewhere, and there is more than one road to success, joy, and a fulfilling life. </li><li> Consider each step forward as a landing point, not an ending point. </li><li> Stressing out about making the perfect choice is what&rsquo;s blocking you from your next step. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Do This to Overcome Indecision and Find Your Next Step: </strong></p><li> Allow yourself to enjoy the discovery without becoming obsessed. Research, talk to mentors and then take a beat to listen to your gut.</li><li> What would you do if money wasn&rsquo;t an obstacle? You won the lottery. Woo Hoo! What new options are here now? What does this tell you about what you need and want to do?</li><li> The rest of your life is a long time. Look for a stepping stone, not a new shore.   <br/>  </li><h3> I Don&rsquo;t Know How to Do What I Want to Do</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Half the battle is having a vision for where you want to go. You can figure out how to get there.   </strong></p><p> A friend of mine always has a new business idea and is a Wisher when it comes to going after her dreams.  She&rsquo;s always thinking about what she&rsquo;ll do and never doing it. She wanted to sell pickled vegetables but didn&rsquo;t know how to do it without a commercial kitchen.  She wanted to open a lunch spot in her town but didn&rsquo;t know how to find a space that would work. In both cases the how was an easy part of the equation, totally something she could figure out if she really wanted to move forward. (hint, she was actually in a different stage of stuck) Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of how, allowing it to become an  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/your-biggest-obstacle-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  obstacle to your success </a> .  </p><p> <strong>  Remember:   </strong></p><li> There are people who have lessons learned and are willing to share.</li><li> You&rsquo;ll get there, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be in a single leap.</li><li> What worked for someone else may not be the secret sauce for you.</li><p> <br/> <strong>  Do This to Overcome Indecision and Find Your Next Step: </strong></p><li> Be honest and <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-achieve-your-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   determine if you&rsquo;re a Wisher, Persister or a Succeeder  </u>    </a> when it comes to your goals </li><li> Experiment! We all wish that there was a magic formula for success, but there&rsquo;s not. Determine desired results, hypothesize, take action, reflect, and adjust. </li><li> Hire an expert who has been where you want to go. Work with an experienced coach or engage people with the expertise you need. You&rsquo;ll find people like  <u>  Ande Lyons </u>  who works with entrepreneurs,  <u>  <a href=\"http://blairglaser.com/courses/intimate-authority/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Blair Glaser  </a> </u> , who helps people step into their authority in their relationships, or  <u>  <a href=\"http://trackingwonder.com/our-story/jeffrey-davis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jeffrey Davis  </a> </u> , who accelerates the success of aspiring writers.  <br/>  </li><p> Part of being stuck is the indecision that it brings, like an unwanted bff that you just can&rsquo;t shake. Knowing where you stand can help you to determine your next step, overcome indecision and move forward creating the full life and professional success you crave.  </p><p> What stage of stuck resonates most with you? What step do you need to take to overcome indecision and move forward with your next step?</p>",

They will become the largest generation this year with 75 million strong and are expected to peak at over 81 million. </p><p> And Boomers? Well everyone knows Boomers have all the money and will experience the largest wealth transfer in history.</p><p> However, Millennials aren&rsquo;t the only buyers out there, and Boomers aren&rsquo;t the only ones with money (or the only ones stressed about retirement). </p><p> There are 65 million of us Gen Xers who are making purchase decisions every day.  And, while the smallest generation today, Gen X will outnumber Boomers in just over a decade.</p><h3> Gen X is actually the next generation.  Just ask us:</h3><li> Who is buying both their parents and their children iPads?</li><li> Who is the Millennial&rsquo;s manager at work?</li><li> Who else is so focused on their children? We are, after all, the helicopter mom generation too. <br/>  </li><h3> Like the middle child, we are just really good at staying off the radar.</h3><p> <br/> For those of us who rode our bikes around the neighborhood unwatched and untethered in the &lsquo;70s (leading me to refer to Gen X at times as the &ldquo;feral generation&rdquo;), who endured the conflicted preppy and punk &lsquo;80s, and who came of age in the grungy, yet bland &lsquo;90s, we can&rsquo;t help but wonder if anyone will ever engage with us.</p><p> <strong>  If nothing else, perhaps Gen X is the most ironic generation. </strong></p>*http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/05/generation-x-americas-neglected-middle-child/",

    "title": "Advisors: Using Visuals and Storytelling to Communicate Online",
    "link": "advisors-using-visuals-and-storytelling-to-communicate-online",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marieswift\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Marie Swift  </u> </a> for <a href=\"http://www.guidevine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Guidevine  </u> </a> Financial advisors that build successful brands online have incorporated their personalities along with their business perspectives. Increasingly though, the next level of success means going beyond text and links, to using images, infographics, multimedia and videos. People learn in various ways and giving them choices based on their mood and personal preferences creates stronger engagement.Fee-only financial planner  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.lifeplanningpartners.com/about-us/who-we-are/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Carolyn McClanahan  </a> </u>  echoed this sentiment when, during a recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://fiws.fidelity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fidelity  </a> </u>  Inside Track event, she said: &ldquo;People want to know you&rsquo;re human. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to show a bit of your personal life and what&rsquo;s important to you when sharing.&rdquo; She suggested some of the most effective ways to achieve this are focusing on are videos and visuals.Also, consider these compelling statistics from Hubspot:</p><li> Photos and images are 2 times more likely to be shared than text updates</li><li> Videos are 12 times more likely to be shared than text and links alone</li><li> 100 million users are taking a social action on YouTube each week</li><li> Over 60 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute</li>So what does this mean for financial advisors today?<h3> 1. Social media is getting more and more visual</h3>Consider the rise of Facebook and Pinterest. Both are highly visual platforms. Photos and memes (quotes and images shown as graphics) are their &ldquo;currency&rdquo;. Even Twitter, which focused on text-and-links, has built in ways to add videos, photos and graphics.This reinforces the trend that people have become lazy readers, especially online. And for businesses, no matter what social platform, dry, boring commentary and overt self-promotion is frowned on. However, visuals and videos can help create interest, engagement and a more personal connection on websites and social networks. The good news is that visuals are easier to capture and share than ever before, thanks to smart phones and digital cameras.<h3> 2. A picture is still worth a thousand words</h3>With the rising use of visuals, the ability for an image to tell an engaging story is more and more important. Perhaps you remember this advertisement in major magazines a few years ago:A handsome, man sits tall on the back of a white stallion. His long-sleeved designer shirt is wrapped around his neck, revealing strong arms and a flat torso. His white slacks are held snug with a brown belt that matches the brown designer boat shoes balanced lightly in the stirrups. The ocean waves roll up onto the white sandy beach in the background. White billowy clouds look like cotton candy in the azure sky. A look of manly pride exudes from his eyes as a drop of sweat glistens on his brow. Perhaps he&rsquo;s just rescued a damsel in distress. One hand is resting on his hip, elbow cocked, while in the other hand, raised up and toward the camera, is a bottle of Old Spice cologne. The caption of the ad reads: &ldquo;Smell like a man, man.&rdquo;This well-staged image, with very little text, stirs curiosity and sparks the imagination. It says more than words describing it can ever say &ndash; and does so in a fraction of the time it takes to read the description. Advisors who can tell stories visually, and not just verbally, draw people in.<h3> 3. Building social capital is important</h3>Social capital is accrued through positive interactions, both online and offline. Negative interactions and snarky attitudes deplete this &ldquo;goodwill bank.&rdquo; The best business leaders know that they must build goodwill before asking for anything.Online, this takes the form of people &ldquo;up-voting&rdquo; by either sharing the content they like and/or agree with, or by unfollowing companies and individuals that become pests. Financial advisors that can reliably produce &ldquo;sharable content&rdquo; will see a corresponding spike in activity on their social media sites. Being boring can mean being ignored. Being negative can have unpredictable consequences.This is yet another way that social media has changed the traditional marketing mix: now, in addition to the &ldquo;earned&rdquo; category (traditional PR and media placements), the &ldquo;owned&rdquo; category (digital assets that one builds, maintains and controls), and the &ldquo;bought&rsquo; category (anything paid for, typically ads and directory listings), we now have the &ldquo;shared&rdquo; category (the process of people in a social network helping good content and ideas ripple out to their friends and colleagues).<h3> 4. Emotions make people want to share</h3>Why do people share content online? In a nutshell, it is because they either have a relationship with the content&rsquo;s author (or want to), or they are emotionally connected with the content being shared. So it all boils down to relationship and emotion, which is same as it ever was.In addition, keep in mind that people are drawn to plain English and simple, compelling stories. More and more, people want not just information and education but to also entertainment as they become enlightened. So think of yourself as an &ldquo;edu-tainer&rdquo;.Click here for more on the psychology of sharing and lessons learned from the <u> <a href=\"http://www.guidevine.com/roundtable/key-creating-highly-sharable-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ALS Ice Bucket Challenge </a></u>.<h3> 5. Video can enrich the communication process</h3>Remember the Hubspot statistics above? Video is 12 times more likely to be shared than text and links alone. Having videos on your website also improves search engine page rankings. Similar to visuals, these days videos are easy to produce and self-publish. Here are the four basic types, though some industry observers have mentioned that the cartoon and white board animations are overdone.<li> Live Action Video:  <u>  The Power of Video </u></li><li> Cartoon Style Video:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlaCaVz0joA#t=11\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Joe Advisor has a Problem  </a> </u></li><li> Motion Graphic Video:  <u>  <a href=\"http://peakadvisoralliance.com/programs/digital-fortress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital Fortress for Time-Strapped Advisors  </a> </u></li><li> White Board Animation Video:  <u>  <a href=\"http://ramseyinvesting.com/whiteboard.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Investor Feels She Doesn&rsquo;t Matter  </a> </u></li>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregoryFCA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Greg Matusky  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.gregoryfca.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u></p><p> Most people fail as speakers simply because they don&rsquo;t know the tips and tricks of great speech-giving. They don&rsquo;t understand how to grab attention, connect thoughts, establish credibility, and deliver the goods in powerful, unforgettable ways. So never fear, anyone can give a masterful speech by simply following some basic tenets: <br/> <br/> <strong>  Know your audience. </strong>  How many times have you sat through a talk and asked like Jim Carrey in \"The Truman Show\" as his fake wife promoted products to an unseen audience, &ldquo;Who are you talking to?&rdquo; Great speeches abide by the same first rule of great communications. First and foremost, know your audience and speak to it.    <br/> <br/> <strong>  Open with a story. </strong>  Confident speech-givers are great storytellers. They draw from their life experiences to connect with audiences. And, they often open with a story before even introducing themselves or thanking the host or audience. They use stories as tools to set entire talks. My greatest opening line ever: &ldquo;Everything I know about public relations I learned from two twin brothers. One a pony-tailed extrovert and the other a barefoot introvert. Together, they taught me how effective storytelling can create a $185 million empire.&rdquo; Got your attention yet? <br/> <br/> <strong>  Vector in on your audience from unexpected angles. </strong>  What does \"Seinfeld\" have to do with Moore&rsquo;s Law? A great deal when you are making the case for how quickly technology evolves. Jerry and the gang&rsquo;s constant confusion would have been easily overcome in today&rsquo;s always connected, Internet-enabled world. GPS would have delivered them to the bubble boy without getting lost. Cell phones would have stopped them from missing each other at the diner. A wireless home alarm system would have kept Kramer from burning down George&rsquo;s girlfriend&rsquo;s family cabin. Nothing seems more random and nothing is more illustrative than vectoring in on Moore&rsquo;s Law for how fast technology evolves by applying it to a sitcom. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Pure energy. </strong>  Leave the white knuckles at the podium and take the fight to the audience. Use movement to draw the eyes of the audience. Then punctuate your talks with powerful body language that draws in attention. Oscillate your voice and show passion and conviction. Energy is the currency of a great talk! Once during a talk, I set a line of six chairs down the center aisle of a venue. Throughout, I asked the audience to write out the six greatest challenges the company faced on cards that we placed on the six chairs. At the end of the talk, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, I had a collegiate hurdler, planted in the audience, rise up and successfully hurdle each chair. Campy? Perhaps. But one year later, everyone in the room remembered the six challenges and had spent the past year working to overcome them.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  The sandwich works. </strong>  After an anecdotal opening, tell them what you are going to tell them. Then return frequently to what you promised to tell them. And at the end, remind them of what you told them. The classic sandwich structure never fails. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Scrap the bulleted PowerPoints. </strong>  Just once, try to replace each of your slides with a single, high-impact image. For laughs and giggles, I once replaced a client&rsquo;s bullet that read, \"the 800-lb gorilla,\" with a full-screen image of an 800-lb gorilla. Searingly memorable.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Practice, we&rsquo;re talking about practice. </strong>  The best presenters I know practice, and practice again. And once they are comfortable, they practice one last time. It takes a lot of work to appear casual and impromptu. After all, it&rsquo;s all about sincerity, and once you can fake that due to practice, you&rsquo;re on your way to becoming a remarkable public speaker. <br/> <br/> So you got it? Anyone can give a memorable talk. You just have to know some of the tips and tricks we train our clients to live by while in front of an audience.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Do you like pushy salespeople in stores or on the car lot?</p><p> Do you enjoy people who only leave you feeling foolish and used?</p><p> Do you like brands who take over your inbox and inundate you with promotional material?</p><p> <strong>  Yea, most people don&rsquo;t. </strong></p><p> In the world of communication, everyone can agree that communicating via text can be tricky. We can easily be misunderstood, confuse the message receiver or upset someone without ever trying to.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s SO important that we are purposeful in everything we do with social media. We can either be negligent and alienate our audience or we can endear them to us.</p><p> Obviously, this article is focusing on the former with the 5 ways we tick people off on social media.</p><p> But let me start with  &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t meant to be judgmental or condemning. My focus is to educate you and make you aware of what you may be doing to push your audience away. And just to smooth things over, I offer ways to do them correctly, IF you want to incorporate these practices into your social strategy.</p><h3> 1. Auto DM&rsquo;s</h3><p> <br/> Automatic Direct Messages on Twitter are my social pet peeve, and have been since the beginning of my personal Twitter history. They&rsquo;re the bane of Twitter and irritate me almost on a daily basis.</p><p> I remember back in 2009, following someone and receiving an auto DM, getting all excited they had spoken to me only to realize it was automated. Talk about a bummer! I felt like an idiot.</p><p> Auto DM&rsquo;s represent everything that social media isn&rsquo;t about &ndash; they&rsquo;re impersonal, rude (especially when pitching something), and assuming. You would never appreciate someone who just walks up to you and pitches their product without knowing who you are or if it would even benefit you.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s exactly what auto DM&rsquo;s do.</p><p> While it has been debated that one can receive a small percentage of outcome (usually about 2%) of response or action from auto DM&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s from the folks who are auto DM&rsquo;ing themselves.</p><p> People do not follow you to receive the latest part of your book, to have you ask them to tweet something or to be used for whatever reason that benefits you most, WITHOUT building a relationship. It&rsquo;s rude, plain and simple.</p><p> <strong>  Do It Right: </strong></p><p> IF you want to participate in the auto DM game, simply say hi, introduce yourself and explain what the follower can look forward to (i.e. VALUE, not sales), or ask a question. BUT if you go the question route, be prepared to be on hand to answer all those questions in real time. Replying to an answer a day later shows you are NOT present and will leave a bad taste.</p><h3> 2. Pushy promotions</h3><p> <br/> Pushy promotions &ndash; oh hey, LinkedIn, here&rsquo;s looking at you!</p><p> What really drives me crazy are the social marketers who spam me about products or services that my agency offers. Why would I need them? And why would my agency hire a social agency?</p><p> Did they even LOOK at my website? Heck no.</p><p> My favorite story of recent spam. A company contacted me on LinkedIn multiple times making their pitch seem somewhat personal by requesting an appointment with me. By the third message, I replied and let the CEO know that I own a social agency and am not interested in their product. In addition, I advised him to use a different avenue besides spam to get business. He arrogantly informed me that it worked for him, that I needed to mind my own business (he contacted ME!), and that a certain percentage of people set up calls with his company everyday.</p><p> Let me know just say this once &ndash; if you have to stoop to spamming people to get business, you may want to rethink what you&rsquo;re selling.</p><p> Nobody appreciates feeling manipulated and bull-dozed about ANY product. I LOVE Express, but I opted out of their email newsletter within two weeks because it was taking over my inbox.</p><p> <strong>  Do It Right: </strong></p><p> Build a relationship &ndash; say hi, comment on their shares, start a conversation. Take the time to do your homework and find out who can actually benefit from your product/service before reaching out to them. Get to know their business online &ndash; check out their website, look at their social channels, and then construct a personal message that points out how you can make a difference.</p><h3> 3. Explosive Updates</h3><p> <br/> Oh man.. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with explosive updates then I&rsquo;ll explain it for you &ndash; this is MULTIPLE updates all within a minute or two (IF you are lucky).</p><p> It can happen on any social network, and will drive you crazy within minutes.</p><p> My current example is of a photographer I recently followed on Instagram. He&rsquo;s incredible, takes beautiful pictures and adds interesting captions. BUT he posts 5-10 pictures at once. It took over my IG stream and I found myself just scrolling through his pictures and being annoyed.</p><p> The upchuck of content isn&rsquo;t making anyone happy &ndash; it&rsquo;s why automation became a thing because people couldn&rsquo;t be around all the time to spread out their status updates.</p><p> And no brand is cool enough to take over someone&rsquo;s stream!</p><p> <strong>  Do It Right: </strong></p><p> Use a scheduling tool to share your content and make sure it&rsquo;s spaced apart adequately. Research the social channel you plan on using and find out how many updates are acceptable and what is considered normal. For instance, posting on IG 3-5x/day is typical for brands with a lot to say. Personally, I think 5-7x/week is sufficient. But experimenting and finding out what works best for YOU is key. Just space it out, folks.</p><h3> 4. Spam</h3><p> <br/> We ALL know what spam is, and unfortunately, we are becoming more and more accustomed to this nasty little word thanks to marketers who have ZERO ethic dilemmas about pushing their messages in your face.</p><p> But what is spam &ndash; it&rsquo;s content or promotion that have absolutely nothing to do with you or isn&rsquo;t something you asked for.</p><p> And let&rsquo;s be honest, WHO likes receiving spam? No one.  <strong>  So why spam others? </strong></p><p> Spam can be those pointless pitches on LinkedIn, the crappy content on Facebook, the annoying pictures on Instagram, or dumb tweets on Twitter.</p><p> <strong>  Do It Right: </strong></p><p> Do NOT spam!! End of story. My philosophy is to &ldquo;post with purpose.&rdquo; Make sure EVERY single post has a purpose or is relevant to the audience you are seeking to build. Add value to their lives, make them laugh or educate them on the industry. Spam is for lazy people or those without direction &ndash; you&rsquo;re WAY better than that.</p><h3> 5. Constant self-promotion</h3><p> <br/> Now I don&rsquo;t know about you, but anyone who&rsquo;s constantly marketing to me is uh, turned OFF. I don&rsquo;t care how much I adore your brand, how cool your product/service is, or how fantastic your customer service is.</p><p> If you are constantly pushing your message in the faces of your online audience, you will tick them off SO fast they&rsquo;ll be running in the other direction.</p><p> It&rsquo;s fascinating to me that businesses wonder why my agency focuses on sharing valuable content with online audiences instead of just promoting. But hey, that&rsquo;s what OLD marketing was, right? We made one commercial or did magazine spreads or newspaper ads, and they were all about promotion!</p><p> But that&rsquo;s old school &ndash; this is social media, and if you aren&rsquo;t building a relationship and sharing a wide range of content with your audience that isn&rsquo;t directly promoting your brand, then you&rsquo;ll find social media to be a lonely place.</p><p> <strong>  Do It Right: </strong></p><p> I like to stick to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/8020-the-perfect-social-content-equation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   80/20 Rule  </a> </u>  with content sharing. It&rsquo;s sharing 80 percent content that isn&rsquo;t directly related to your brand, and 20 percent that is. The unrelated content should be informative, funny, or educational &ndash; value, not spam. And the 20 percent of direct promotions or can be pictures than humanize your brand, a video tutorial or a free download. The bottom line, current social etiquette dictates that we serve and add value instead of being pushy car salesmen. Promise!</p><p> What is YOUR social media pet peeve?</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  With around 350 million global users </strong> - most of whom use the platform for business - it was only a matter of time before LinkedIn wanted in on the action of social media management. Hence the creation of its new app, Elevate, which Tech Crunch recently reported on.</p><p> The paid mobile and desktop app was unveiled just a couple of weeks ago, and aims to help users find content that's relevant to their industry using a combination of Pulse and Newsle algorithms, as well as content actually curated by humans (how novel!).</p><p> The purpose is so that <strong>  users can then share these articles on their own LinkedIn pages, as well as on Twitter and, in time, Facebook - without having to search for the content themselves. </strong></p><p> Essentially, the concept can be viewed as an amalgamation of Hootsuite, which allows users to share pre-scheduled content on their social media page; and Buffer, which suggests content to users before allowing them to schedule what time they wish to share it. And just like these two applications, Elevate is aimed at social media marketing professionals.</p><p> In theory, with Elevate you can stay active on LinkedIn and Twitter even when you don't have anything particularly interesting to say yourself. It can supposedly even help all employees to become more social-media-savvy, as it its helps with tracking the impact of content on profile views and follower numbers - something that, as product manager Will Sun claims, can enable general \"employees to be social professionals.\"</p><p> This could actually be one of the main benefits of the app - <strong>  encouraging more employees to get involved in the conversation and become brand advocates on social media. </strong> Figures show that currently, just <strong>  2% of an organisation's employees share company news on LinkedIn </strong> , meaning there is a huge untapped audience out there. I firmly believe that companies that are able to galvanise their staff into effective content amplification have a huge advantage over their competitors and that clearly the role that Elevate is looking to fulfil.</p><p> LinkedIn has just piloted a paid version of Elevate, which will be available to download via iOS or Android for those who are willing to pay for the service. The aim then is to make it generally available later in the year, when more details about pricing will be unveiled.</p><p> While the app seems sure to help businesses generate more activity on LinkedIn, it's important to remember that the most sophisticated curation tool in the world is no substitute for creating great content yourself and taking the time to engage in conversations with others in your industry.</p><p> This said, with a clear gap in the market and the weight of LinkedIn behind it, I'm betting on Elevate being a big success. And, needless to say, if any of the Elevate team happen to be reading this, yes I'd love to get involved in the pilot!</p>",

The trust is structured to release funds to Bobbi Kristina as follows:</p><li> 10% of Whitney&rsquo;s estate was transferred to Bobbi Kristina on her 21st birthday</li><li> Another 1/6th on her 25th birthday</li><li> At 30, Bobbi Kristina gets the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remainder\" target=\"_blank\">   remainder  </a> </u> <br/>  </li><p> While the testamentary trust created by Whitney shows some foresight in holding back assets until her daughter is slightly older, it sidesteps the questions faced by parents interested in passing wealth to their children, including:</p><li> Is my child mature enough to receive significant wealth with no outside guidance?

Whitney never updated her Will when she divorced Mr. Brown. In Whitney&rsquo;s Will she named Mr. Brown as  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian\" target=\"_blank\">   guardian  </a> </u>  of Bobbi Kristina at that time.

It&rsquo;s extremely unfortunate that Bobbi Kristina&rsquo;s plight is common knowledge, and we hope for a full recovery, but we must learn from her situation to ensure we protect our families to the best of our abilities.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What is depression?</h3><p> <br/> Depression is a sickness that we can trace right back to biblical times when we read about Job, who lost fortune and family and was afflicted with boils covering his body. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be depressed in those circumstances? Today over 75,000 people per year, commit suicide in North America. Investigations reveal that over half of these victims were suffering from depression. Add to that the fact that only a small percentage who attempt suicide actually succeed. Depression can be indeed a terminal illness. It can also be beat and prevented by acquiring a few simple habits.</p><h3> Who is affected? <br/>  </h3><p> Depression seems to be a universal illness that most of us have experienced to some degree in life. We all seem to be susceptible, regardless of position, possessions or popularity. I have met depressed accountants, housewives, pastors, construction workers and businessmen. Even Sir Winston Churchill was given to severe bouts of depression and yet was a great leader at a time of national crisis. Some of the world&rsquo;s greatest men were plagued with this problem and would fall into a period of depression after some outstanding accomplishment. It seems they had just run out of goals, just as I had when I hit burnout at the age of 27. <br/>  </p><h3> What is the cause of depression? <br/>  </h3><li> ​The number-one cause of depression is the lack of clearly defined long-term goals. It is also important to note that it is quite normal to experience depression soon after you have achieved a worthy goal, but before you&rsquo;ve taken time to set another goal.</li><li> Depression is also caused by looking inward instead of being focused on helping others. Helping others in need, makes us forget we need help ourselves.</li><li> Another cause of depression is a chemical imbalance in our bodies. Sometimes this is caused by a lack of physical exercise, and at other times, it is a hereditary thing, and still other times it can be some traumatic experience from our past.</li><li> Reading and watching negative news can cause depression. The media pumps negativity into our minds because that&rsquo;s what sells their newspapers and gets their TV ratings up. We become what we think about the most.</li><li> Being around negative people is a depressing experience in itself. Negative people can get positive people down a lot easier than the other way around.</li><li> Negative self-talk will cause depression. Our sub-conscious mind receives self-talk messages at the rate of 1200 words per minute. That&rsquo;s twenty words every second. It&rsquo;s easy to see how we can talk ourselves up or down very quickly at that rate. <br/>  </li><h3> Six Habits that will help you beat depression and live again <br/>  </h3><li> Set clearly defined long-term goals in every area of your life.</li><li> Get involved in something bigger than yourself. There is nothing as uplifting as helping another human being.</li><li> Have a regular checkup. Where your body goes, your mind follows.</li><li> Limit your TV time. The top CEO&rsquo;s only watch an average of five hours of TV per week when the average North American watches five times as much.</li><li> To be happy and positive, it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary to surround ourselves with happy and positive people.</li><li> Talk to yourself in positive manner. It&rsquo;s amazing how happy some people can be amidst some of life&rsquo;s saddest experiences. Their joy just continues to radiate, while others seem to find a reason to be depressed over joyful circumstances. Recovery from depression is only possible when we realize that it is our attitude toward circumstances, not the circumstances themselves that cause us to be depressed.</li>",

    "link": "advisors-five-things-to-avoid-when-creating-graphs-and-charts",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Using a chart or graph can be a simple and eye-catching way to display information that might otherwise need paragraphs (or pages!) of text to explain.</p><p> When done well, your audience should be able to scan and interpret your graphics quickly and easily. When done not-so-well, simple graphics can confuse a reader. Here are some things to avoid doing when visually displaying information.</p><h3> 3D and other special effects</h3><p> <br/> Using 3D and blow-apart effects can make your data hard to interpret. Think about a 3D bar chart for a minute. The 3D effect is created by angling the bar upward. What part of the bar is your reader supposed to be looking at? The front (the lowest part) or the back (the highest)?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re not there to explain the data, don&rsquo;t be surprised if your readers can&rsquo;t figure it out on their own.</p><p> Blow-apart effects, which we often see with pie charts, create similar issues. The parts of the pie are harder to compare when they&rsquo;re blown apart, which can lead to misinterpretation of your data ( <u>  <a href=\"http://guides.library.duke.edu/topten\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   source  </a> </u> ). Remember, <strong>  your readers should be able to interpret a well-designed graphic at a glance. Don&rsquo;t make them work for it. </strong></p><h3> Odd scales</h3><p> <br/> Another way to make your readers work is to challenge their assumptions. And most readers assume that most charts start at zero. Starting a scale with a number other than zero can distort your information, leaving the impression that your data has been skewed.</p><h3> Information overload</h3><p> <br/> Trying to present too much information on a line graph reduces your readers&rsquo; understanding of what you&rsquo;re trying to say, because it makes it difficult to find the data points on your graph. Similarly, too many bars in a bar chart can make it hard to distinguish between groups of data. You&rsquo;ve seen these charts, where all the information just blends together.</p><p> If you have too much information to present, consider creating a series of charts by grouping different sets of data in a logical way. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, it might be best to skip the chart in this case and tell your story with text.</p><h3> Too many/non-contrasting colours</h3><p> <br/> Eye-catching graphics use colour, but using too many colours can leave your chart looking messy. It can also confuse readers as they start to lose track of which colour was supposed to represent which piece of information.</p><p> Six is the maximum number of colours you should use, but most sources will tell you a three-colour palette is ideal. And if there&rsquo;s any chance your chart will be printed out or viewed in black and white, choose a palette with plenty of contrast.</p><h3> Skipping the text</h3><p> <br/> A well-designed graphic is a great way to present information for visual learners. You know, those people whose eyes glaze over when they see paragraphs of text followed by more paragraphs of text. But don&rsquo;t underestimate how important it is to reach all types of learners. There are plenty of people who will struggle to interpret a line chart no matter how simple it seems or how well it&rsquo;s designed.</p><p> To make the biggest impact and reach the widest audience, use a mix of graphics and well written text. Your readers will thank you.</p>",

    "title": "3 Reasons To Use Social Media For Customer Service",
    "link": "3-reasons-to-use-social-media-for-customer-service",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyZayas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tony Zayas  </u> </a></p><p> One of the very reasons that many businesses shy away from social media, or don&rsquo;t go all in on social media, is exactly the reason why they should be. What I&rsquo;m referring to here is that unsocial businesses do not have full control of the messages conveyed about the business. While this may seem scary to those living in the old world, this is understandable yet the truth is that in today&rsquo;s world, everyone is part of social. And if you don&rsquo;t think so, you just aren&rsquo;t aware of it.</p><p> Conversation on social media will happen, why not be part and stand up for your brand? Here are three reasons to do just that.</p><h3> Reason #1: Problems Become Opportunities</h3><p> The very things that businesses don&rsquo;t want to be said about them in open forums, like social media, actually often presents greater opportunity than any possible damage. Before I go any deeper in explaining, the only way to take advantage of this opportunity is if the brand is in the game &mdash; meaning the business is active on social media to interact with the parties expressing something less than positive about their brand.</p><p> Now, talk about not having control of your brand message, since that is exactly what&rsquo;s happening when businesses are not showing up on social. They are defined by what others say about them, and have no opportunity to set the record straight or define the brand themselves. Whereas when you show up, you have the opportunity to put your best foot forward and correct unfortunate situations.</p><h3> Reason #2: People are Forgiving if a Wrong is Made Right</h3><p> The great news about criticism and complaints that pop up on social is that when your business has a presence, you can respond. Another great thing is that for the most part human beings are pretty happy to give businesses a second chance, if they feel it&rsquo;s warranted. Of course, part of this is that your business must be willing to right some or many of the wrongs that have happened, but when that does happen both customers and observers tend to leave with a smile.</p><h3> Reason #3: Allows Your Followers to See You Do the Right Thing</h3><p> Should the situation arise, the one that you&rsquo;ve had nightmares about where customers are saying damaging things about your brand, get involved and take action. Remember, everyone&rsquo;s watching, so do the right thing. If you do the right thing and take care of the customer you&rsquo;re developing an opportunity for your audience to see you in an even better light than they had prior. This goes even if the complaint criticism was warranted in the first.</p><p> People understand that businesses will make mistakes and not always deliver 100% satisfaction. What they cannot live with is poor customer service. By publicly demonstrating excellent customer service, you are creating a situation where you can win over lifelong brand ambassadors.</p>",

One went so far as to compare a Corporate Vision Statement to a &ldquo;cute slogan&mdash;like a bumper sticker.&rdquo; </p><h3> Well, here&rsquo;s my take on that.</h3><p> <br/> In my work as a consultant for dozens of successful organizations over the past 30 years, I&rsquo;ve concluded that a compelling Vision of the future&mdash;a Vision of greatness, of what &ldquo;could be&rdquo;&mdash;is the prime mover in virtually all the best companies.</p><h3> At its simplest, a Vision describes a preferred reality.</h3><p> <br/> It reminds us that we are not stuck with the present, and that we can join forces with our employees and colleagues to &ldquo;invent&rdquo; a better future for ourselves, our company and our community. &ldquo;A vision foretells what may be ours,&rdquo; wrote Katherine Logan. &ldquo;It is an invitation to do something better, higher and more satisfying.&rdquo;</p><p> Grappling with what is &ldquo;better, higher and more satisfying&rdquo; for your own department or company can be hard work. And yet the final Vision statement itself can usually be expressed in the simplest terms.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;All men are created equal,&rdquo; </strong> is a five-word Vision statement articulated by our founding fathers, but those five little words rocked the world.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Put a man on the moon in this decade,&rdquo; </strong> is a nine-word Vision statement articulated by John F. Kennedy. But those nine little words inspired the worldwide scientific community to achieve what was previously deemed impossible.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;A computer on every desk,&rdquo; </strong> was the basic Vision pursued by both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in the Sixties and Seventies. But that simple little vision statement proved to be a lot more powerful than just a &ldquo;cute little slogan or bumper sticker.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Vision grabs,&rdquo; wrote Warren Bennis in his iconic book, Leaders. &ldquo;First it grabs the leader. Then it becomes the leader&rsquo;s job to translate the Vision into a practical plan of action and get everyone in the organization onboard.&rdquo; So the next time you hear someone disparaging the value of the Visioning process, ask yourself this question: &ldquo;What exactly is the role of today&rsquo;s leader?&rdquo;</p><h3> Your role is not to know everything.</h3><p> <br/> Your role is not to do everything. Your role is not to run around motivating or threatening everyone. From where I sit, the role of today&rsquo;s leader is to mobilize everyone on your team or in your organization around a compelling Vision of the future. And you can&rsquo;t possibly do that unless you first take the time to articulate that Vision, and make it public. Start with the Vision, and then succeed with the plan.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Boyer__Boyer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brianne Kaufman  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://boyerboyer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Boyer and Boyer  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;m single and I don&rsquo;t need an estate plan, right? </strong> It&rsquo;s not like I have children or grandchildren to give my money to, so why bother? Unfortunately, it may not be as simple as that..</p><p> Keep this rule in mind before you decide if you should consult an attorney about estate planning: if you don&rsquo;t make a will, the state will decide on the division of your property according to statutes. The state&rsquo;s division may not be what you wanted, especially when it comes to single people.</p><p> Generally, if you are single, the state will pass your estate to your children or other living relatives. This is fine, most of the time. However, there are cases where a parent may want something else.</p><h3> Here is where the truly depressing, singular scenario comes to fruition:</h3><p> <br/> You are not married and have no children. You have no relatives, you lived a long and splendid life and outlived all your kin. You did not make a will or trust to devise your property to a friend or organization. Guess where your estate is going?</p><p> Your estate is going to the state. This may not please you. Any close friends you had that you assumed could be entitled to your estate, or any organizations that you ardently supported when you were living will receive no part of your estate. You may inadvertently be funding highway maintenance instead of continuing your life&rsquo;s mission of helping shelter animals.</p><p> Think of it this way: Without a will, you have no compass and no direction. <strong>  Without a will, you've lost your way. </strong></p><p> Beyond creating a will to devise who should get your property after death, a single person could also benefit from creating a durable power of attorney. You would use this document to appoint an agent, called an &ldquo;attorney in fact&rdquo; who would make financial decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated.</p><p> A close friend or trusted relative should serve as the &ldquo;attorney in fact&rdquo; for a single person. Having the power of attorney card in your deck can prevent a guardian from having to be appointed to act on your behalf in the event of your incapacitation. The process of drafting a durable power of attorney is less costly and time-consuming than a guardianship and will ultimately save your friends and family the trouble of going to court to be appointed as guardian and submitting annual reports on your welfare.</p><p> Another important document for a single person to have in place is a living will. The living will stipulates what will happen to you if you enter in to an end-stage condition such as a coma. Doctors must abide by this document and through it you can express your wishes and save family members the stress of making the decision for you.</p><p> Also, consider making a trust if you plan to give large sums of money to a niece or nephew you think may not have mastered the powers of restraint -- if you don&rsquo;t want them to spend it all in one place. A charitable trust can also be set up to give monthly or yearly gifts to your favorite charitable organization.</p><h3> In conclusion, I&rsquo;m single and I don&rsquo;t need an estate plan, right?</h3><p> <br/> Well, not always. Unless you really want to help build that new expressway&hellip;</p>",

    "content": "<p> In early March, I made the case that there&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11074\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  no greater vote of confidence </a>  in a company&rsquo;s growth prospects than when its top officers put some skin in the game and buy their own company stock. Among the examples I used were Warren Buffett, who owns millions of shares in Berkshire Hathaway; Elon Musk, who purchased over $100 million worth of Tesla stock in 2013; and myself, the largest shareholder of U.S. Global Investors.</p><p> Another example of how bullish an executive is on his own company is when he chooses to forego a base salary entirely and instead be compensated in company stock.</p><p> The most recent chief executive officer to receive such compensation is American Airline&rsquo;s Doug Parker.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-07-at-8.19.22-AM.png\" width=\"914\"/></p><h3> In a letter to employees, Parker wrote:</h3><p> <br/> Going forward, I have asked our Board to restructure my compensation such that I will no longer receive a base salary or an annual bonus. Instead, all of my primary compensation will be paid in AAL stock. This stock will have to be earned over time, and will also have to be earned by performance. I believe this is the right way for my compensation to be set&mdash;at risk, based entirely on the results achieved, and in the same currency that our shareholders receive.</p><p> Parker has such confidence in his own company and the industry in general that he&rsquo;s willing to place a huge portion of his financial security in its hands. This, along with American&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11075\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent addition to the S&amp;P 500 Index, </a>  should make investors&rsquo; ears perk up.</p><p> He&rsquo;s not the only CEO who&rsquo;s switched to stock.</p><p> Fellow airline executive Maurice J. Gallagher Jr. of Allegiant Air has also passed on cash, receiving a little over half a million dollars in stock and options in 2013 alone.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-07-at-8.16.40-AM.png\" width=\"650\"/></p><p> The late, great Steve Jobs was famously paid $1 a year to serve as CEO of Apple&mdash;which we own in our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11069\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  All American Equity Fund (GTBFX) </a>  and  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11070\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Holmes Macro Trends Fund (MEGAX) </a> &mdash;taking his real payment in company shares. In February 2011, a few months before his death, it was reported that Jobs owned about 5.5 million shares in Apple stock, which at the time was worth a little over $2 billion.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-07-at-8.26.01-AM.png\" width=\"582\"/></p><p> Another notable example is Larry Ellison, co-founder and former CEO of computer technology company Oracle, also held in GBTFX. In 2013, Ellison was the most highly compensated CEO out of the 300 who were featured in the Wall Street Journal/Hay group CEO Compensation Study. During his final full year of work at Oracle, he received $67.3 million&mdash;nearly all of it in stock options.</p><p> Stock has been steadily growing in importance as a form of compensation for the most successful CEOs. Between 2009 and 2013, performance stock for those leading S&amp;P 1500 Index companies rose 52 percent, the largest increase of any other type of payment. Compared to all other methods, in fact, performance stock is now the most-preferred, according to executive compensation consultancy firm Equilar.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-07-at-8.17.26-AM.png\" width=\"641\"/></p><h3> Stock isn&rsquo;t just good for executives; it&rsquo;s also good for shareholders.</h3><p> <br/> In a 2010 study piece that appeared in the NYU Journal of Law &amp; Business, Villanova University Business Law Professor Richard A. Booth writes that &ldquo;stock options are indeed the best form of incentive compensation yet devised&rdquo; for CEOs. His reasoning: &ldquo;[I]t is the supposed duty of the directors and officers to maximize stockholder value. In practice, there are few situations in which that duty is enforced as a matter of law. Options fill the gap.&rdquo;</p><p> Although options are a specific type of security, giving the holder the right to buy or sell shares at a later date, they&rsquo;re used here as a proxy for the broader argument that stock helps executives better align their interests with shareholders&rsquo;.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Male and Female Advisors each bring a unique set of skills to the business, and when the chemistry between partners is a good fit their ability to capture more business can become unstoppable&hellip; leading to more referrals, assets and production well beyond the next decade.</p><p> The key to a highly productive gender balanced team is understanding your partner&rsquo;s natural strengths, trusting their judgment, and respecting their perception and point of view. While there are many male advisors who work exceptionally well with women the biological make up of a female advisor can add tremendous value when serving the financial needs of women and future generations.</p><p> We know men tend to be more linear with strong warrior (closing) skills, but understanding the natural strengths a woman brings to the table will only enhance your business success.</p><h3> So what do women have that men don&rsquo;t?</h3><p> <br/> From an early age female babies become more receptive to feelings, responding more to the facial expressions of others developing that sixth sense or otherwise called &ldquo;women&rsquo;s intuition&rdquo;. While women&rsquo;s intuition was never considered a viable skill in the traditional business world, in fact it was often considered a weakness, today financial firms are recognizing this intuitive sense in women can be a valuable asset as a financial advisor.</p><p> In a business mired in numbers, ratios and tangible results the value women add is often more subtle yet highly effective in retaining more clients, capturing more assets and inspiring referrals. The following key points highlight what I feel are three of the most powerful natural assets that a female advisor can add to enhance relationships, receptivity and business growth.</p><h3> 3 Powerful Women Assets</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Noticing Unspoken Indicators:  </strong> &ldquo;Men pick up the subtle signs of sadness or distress in a female face only 40 percent of the time, whereas women can pick up these signs 90% of the time.&rdquo;</p><p> Using their well-honed sensory system a female advisor may be better equipped to pick up on signs as to how the client or prospect is receiving the information. A female advisor may notice unspoken indicators that the woman may be withdrawing, distancing herself or becoming even angry as the presentation proceeds. Trusting her instincts, a female advisor can intercede and possibly re-engage the woman by asking additional questions that bring her back to the table feeling more comfortable and receptive to the desired outcome.</p><p> <strong>  2. Ability To Read Between The Lines:  </strong> &ldquo;Overall, the female brain is gifted at quickly assessing the thoughts, beliefs and intentions of others based on the smallest of hints. Hints that the male advisor may miss altogether. &ldquo;</p><p> The more traditional linear approach to gathering data can often overshadow the underlying issues important to the woman as a client or prospect. A female advisor can often read between the lines, receptive to nuances in behavior, tone of voice even body language especially with women who are unaccustomed to verbalizing their needs and desires. These that may indicate a bigger priority or underlying concern.</p><p> By acting on these conflicted feelings a female advisors natural tendency is to probe further asking deeper more thought provoking questions. This process can often uncover and dislodge valuable information that even the female client or prospect was unable to clarify much less articulate. As a result the woman feels appreciated, respected and valued as her opinions and desires are eloquently brought to the surface and placed on the table for further discussion.</p><p> <strong>  3. Desire To Communicate: </strong>  &ldquo;Connecting through talking activates the pleasure centers in a woman&rsquo;s brain creating a surge of Dopamine which stimulate the motivation and pleasure circuits in the brain&rdquo;</p><p> A female advisor naturally understands the importance of communication and making strong connections with a woman or perhaps it&rsquo;s simply because they have had more practice. Women tend to speak 3 times more than a man or 75,000 words a day vs men who tend to only speak 25,000 words a day. The need and desire to engage in discussions are natural tendencies for both the female advisor and female prospect. Allowing this interaction to take place prior to running through a structured agenda or presentation can create a more positive environment, enhance the relationship building process and setting the stage for a more productive and successful meeting.</p><h3> The Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> A gender-blended partnership can have a monumental impact on the future growth of any financial practice but finding the right partner is critical to success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  This morning I hit the snooze button. </strong></p><h3> And it was glorious.</h3><p> <br/> Those 7 minutes felt like the most indulgent and decadent thing I could possibly give myself (of the things I typically engage in at 7 am)</p><p> And while that time may not have made up for that extra episode of &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.fox.com/new-girl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   New Girl  </u> </a> &rdquo; the night before, I used the snooze the way I typically do: semi-consciously envisioning my day and rationalizing the snooze itself. And that&rsquo;s precisely what inspired this post.</p><p> See, we all make small decisions that we rationalize. Whether it&rsquo;s snoozing, quitting a job, or ending a relationship, we all have motivators that cause us to make a decision and justifications that convince us that we made  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/how-to-stop-spiraling-and-start-solving-your-problems\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   the right one  </u>  . </a></p><p> Take my snooze for example. I was motivated by my laziness, warm bed, and cute dog. In the past, I might have hit the snooze button until I was dangerously close to being late for work. This time, I did a sleepy cost-benefit analysis and decided that there were no short-term consequences since my first client wasn&rsquo;t until 10. As for long-term consequences, I highly doubted that the 7 minute shift would throw my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/self-care-worksheets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   circadian rhythm  </a> </u>  to shit. And so I enjoyed my snooze, knowing that I had made an informed and conscious decision.</p><p> Of course, there have been plenty of times when my decisions followed a very different pattern:</p><li> <strong>  I&rsquo;d feel discomfort </strong> (I&rsquo;m lonely.)</li><li> <strong>  I&rsquo;d take an action to alleviate the discomfort </strong> (I&rsquo;ll call ____ to have some company even though I know she usually pisses me off.)</li><li> <strong>  I&rsquo;d rationalize the action </strong> (I feel worse, but I couldn't think of a better option.) <br/>  </li><p> That pattern is usually what resulted in my staying in bad relationships, having an extra drink, or calling out sick. Thankfully, I&rsquo;ve learned:</p><h3> The Formula for Conscious Decision Making</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Observe my rational &amp; emotional motivators: </strong></p><p> How much of this is based on my feelings and how much is based on facts?</p><p> <strong>  2. Analyze short &amp; long term benefits: </strong></p><li> How will this impact me in the short term AND the long term?</li><li> Will this get me closer to or further from my goals?</li><li> Is this in line with my values? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3. Evaluate the results: </strong></p><li> How do I feel?</li><li> Did I get the results I want?</li><li> What might I do differently next time? <br/>  </li><p> This formula, though simple, isn&rsquo;t one that most people consciously engage in. Left to our own devices, we are conditioned to take the action that favors alleviating short-term discomfort despite the long-term consequences. </p><h3> My Challenge To You:</h3><p> <br/> For 24 hours, consciously choose actions that align with your long term goals, your values, and your best self instead of what feels good in the moment. After all, awareness creates choice. And choice creates freedom.</p><p> As for me, I will always be grateful that being a &ldquo;morning person&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t one of my aspirations. So please excuse me, I require a mid-morning nap.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I was sitting down to write today, and the story that came over the news was the headline that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/05/dave-goldberg-death-the-result-of-head-trauma-while-exercising/26875183/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dave Goldberg  </a> </u> , the husband of Facebook&rsquo;s COO  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg\" target=\"_blank\">   Sheryl Sandberg  </a> </u> , just died from a senseless treadmill accident while on vacation in Puerto Vallarta. At age 47. Suddenly this husband and father of two young children is gone, and nothing will ever be the same for them.</p><p> Of course, Ms. Sandberg is financially secure. Her career is the one that has made headlines, and her husband was probably well insured. But as a widow, her life has changed in an instant. Coping with such a loss can be devastating&mdash;and even more so if plans aren&rsquo;t in place to help manage the unexpected.</p><h3> If you know me at all, you know that I speak from experience.</h3><p> <br/> When I was in my late 40s, my husband, Ed, suffered a debilitating stroke and became permanently disabled. Our children were almost adults at the time, so I had no children to support on my own, but Ed and I had not planned for disability. Why would we? He was a healthy, young guy. But what a difference it would have made if we had. Without the insurance we needed, we instantly went from a comfortable income to relying solely on my earnings, and our cost of living increased considerably to cover Ed&rsquo;s new care needs. If we&rsquo;d planned properly, I could have focused more on the emotional healing for all of us&mdash;Ed, myself, and our children Jamie and Adam.</p><p> Luckily for us, it wasn&rsquo;t all bleak; although Ed had no disability income insurance at the time, as an Air Force retiree he did have a lifetime pension, and after 18 months he became eligible for additional disability income from Social Security. Still, times were tough for us for the next decade, and when he did pass away 11 years later, he had no life insurance. In an instant&mdash;&ldquo;an ordinary instant&rdquo;&mdash;my life changed completely.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Didion\" target=\"_blank\">   Joan Didion  </a> </u> , one of my favorite authors, wrote a beautiful book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Year-Magical-Thinking-Joan-Didion/dp/1400078431\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Year of Magical Thinking  </a> </u> , in the year following the death of her own husband of 40 years, writer  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gregory_Dunne\" target=\"_blank\">   John Gregory Dunne  </a> </u> . In a similar life-changing instant, Dunne suffered a massive heart attack and died immediately. His death propelled Didion into a year of, as she calls it, \"magical thinking.\"</p><p> &ldquo;Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. We anticipate (we know) that someone close to us could die, but we do not look beyond the few days or weeks that immediately follow such an imagined death. We misconstrue the nature of even those few days or weeks. We might expect if the death is sudden to feel shock. We do not expect this shock to be obliterative, dislocating to both body and mind. We might expect that we will be prostrate, inconsolable, crazy with loss. We do not expect to be literally crazy, cool customers who believe their husband is about to return and need his shoes.&rdquo;</p><h3> I love Didion's re-labeling of this time of mourning as &ldquo;magical thinking.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve experienced it yourself, as I have, you already know precisely what she means. Your perspectives change radically, and you speak words and take actions that, before now, would have been unthinkable. Interestingly, I read The Year of Magical Thinking before and after losing Ed. Experiencing that loss changed my thinking entirely, and words I thought I&rsquo;d understood initially took on a whole new meaning as I was living it myself. I realized then that you can never really understand such a loss until you&rsquo;ve been there yourself.</p><p> Sheryl Sandberg will find her own way to cope with the unexpected loss of her husband. I hope she has the support she needs in all areas of her life. I hope her own &ldquo;year of magical thinking&rdquo; can help her make sense of her loss. For me, my husband&rsquo;s disability and death taught me valuable life lessons. The experience taught me how strong I could be (stronger than I may have ever thought possible), the power of what Didion describes as &ldquo;magical thinking,&rdquo; and the importance of planning for a loss that, for most, is fully unimaginable until it happens.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The open-door policy is a beautiful idea &mdash; in theory. The communication policy encourages employees to speak their minds on issues within the company and offer suggestions for improvement. &ldquo;Open-door,&rdquo; in essence, means that managers are always welcoming feedback by metaphorically or physically leaving their office doors open.</p><p> However, the open-door policy doesn&rsquo;t always work the way you&rsquo;ve imagined. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/frankly-speaking/article4352444/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Globe and Mail  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/06/debunking-four-myths-about-employee-silence/ar/1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> :</p><li> 44% of employees reported they do not feel free to speak their minds to their bosses</li><li> 42% of employees admitted to speaking up but withholding information if they believe they have nothing to gain or something to lose by sharing</li><li> 20% of employees say a fear of consequences has kept them from addressing ordinary company problems <br/>  </li><p> When nearly half of employees in a survey report that they do not feel free to address issues with their bosses, we have a major problem in company communication &mdash; even among those that claim to have an open-door policy. This policy has three major flaws related to the above statistics, but luckily, they can all be addressed in an updated feedback policy.</p><h3> Problem No. 1: The Fear of Repercussions</h3><p> <br/> Everyone has been in a position to have to comment on something they see as negative. It&rsquo;s not an easy position to be in &mdash; especially for people sensitive toward others. Add on top of that, the person you are giving direct feedback to is the one holding your paycheck, and this concern can easily escalate into fear.</p><p> Harvard Business Review found that this fear of consequences &mdash; whether out of malice or more commonly, because of a miscommunication &mdash; is largely imagined, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not holding people back from taking part in feedback.</p><p> Instead, employees can be relieved from this burden by using any number of anonymous feedback systems. And because so many employees report withholding the full story out of this fear, you&rsquo;re more likely to get honest, more helpful feedback.</p><h3> Problem No. 2: No Incentive for Feedback</h3><p> <br/> Encouraging feedback should be embedded into your culture. Unfortunately, even in organizations claiming to have an open-door policy, it isn&rsquo;t reinforced. Push for feedback on a regular basis, showing just how much you encourage accepting critique and suggestions.</p><p> Companies can even offer incentives for participating in feedback initiatives. For example, anyone who fills out a satisfaction survey can be entered into a raffle to win an iPad or even a day off work. Some companies have found success by promoting a charitable donation if a survey receives a certain amount of responses.</p><h3> Problem No. 3: The Broken Feedback Loop</h3><p> <br/> An open-door policy essentially allows employees to report problems. There&rsquo;s nothing built into the system to see any movement on the solution to that problem. Transparency, or the lack thereof, is a huge issue. Why would anyone report an issue if they don&rsquo;t ever see things being done about it?</p><p> Instead, an effective feedback policy should be a two-way street, building in management communication of the reported issues and exactly how they are working toward solutions. There should be benchmarks in working toward these goals that everyone in the company can follow along with, clearly and openly.</p><p> <strong>  While a great idea in theory, the open-door policy is flawed. </strong> There are, however, ways for companies to take the basic idea of a employee feedback encouragement policy and embed it into their company culture in a far more effective way.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> As a kid, my summer job was to pull fifty-pound bales of hay into piles so Dad could scoop them up easier with his loader tractor. Mom and my brother were on the haystack arranging the bales as dad dumped them. When I looked around, there was nothing but miles of bales all lined up for as far as I could see, waiting for me to move every single one of them.</p><p> At that time,  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bewitched\" target=\"_blank\">   Bewitched  </a> </u>  was my favorite TV show and I daydreamed about having magical powers to make all the bales of hay go away. I moved in a daze of wishful thinking, wanting enough magical power to zap myself to a place that was cool, clean, and fun . . .</p><p> My Grandmother spent the day in the hayfield as well. Her job was to set the irrigation after the hay bales had been picked up. Suddenly, I was buried in a cloud of thick dust when she abruptly put on the pickup brakes and stopped beside me. She had noticed that my mind was elsewhere and I wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention to my job.</p><p> Grandmother was a realist and knew wishful thinking was a waste of time. She was a very practical person; she knew how to rebuild engines and her salad bowls all said Cool Whip on the side.</p><p> &ldquo;Just remember,&rdquo; she shouted out from the pickup. &ldquo;Wishful thinking is for wimps. Now get those bales in piles like you&rsquo;ve been told to do.&rdquo;</p><p> She left me choking in the dust she stirred up when she spun the back tires getting back onto the road. I never argued with my Grandmother. Her favorite back scratcher was a toilet brush and she never hesitated using it to spank me, either.</p><p> I grew up believing that wishful thinking and positive thinking were much the same thing. Neither had much heft to them. I preferred to think of myself as a realist. But when I entered the FBI Academy and found myself surrounded by people who had survived shootouts and active combat, I learned that mental power is just as important as physical power.</p><h3> Wishful thinking is watered down positive thinking.</h3><p> <br/> When we focus on the <u>  f  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/1768515/how-positive-thinking-sets-you-fail\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   uture of our dreams  </a> </u> , our minds enjoy and indulge in those images as if they were real. We don&rsquo;t stop to think about the chances of them becoming real or the hurdles that will need to be overcome. Instead, we enjoy the fantasy.</p><p> Wishful thinking is believing the world is shaped by our wants and desires and that by focusing on the good, the bad ceases to exist.</p><p> This type of thinking is not only for wimps, it&rsquo;s downright harmful. Unfortunately, much of what we think and understand about positive thinking is tainted by the triteness of wishful thinking. Instead of wimps, we need leaders with  <u>  mental toughness </u>  who are strong thinkers.

    "content": "<h3> It&rsquo;s a tricky thing being your own evangelist.</h3><p> <br/> Crowing to the rooftops is not such a stretch when you&rsquo;re selling your snazzy new product or the team of awesome people behind you.</p><p> Bragging on someone&mdash;or something&mdash;you&rsquo;re excited about comes effortlessly.</p><p> Where it gets sticky is when you need to sell YOU.</p><p> When you are the pivot point.</p><p> When you want to be chosen. As the keynote speaker. As the first choice for a bet-the-business challenge. As the soloist competing against the name brands.</p><p> Selling yourself&mdash;your talents, passion, experience and commitment to getting the job done&mdash;is the difference between winning big and going home with your tail between your legs.</p><p> Because if you don&rsquo;t believe what you&rsquo;re preaching who will?</p><p> That&rsquo;s why you need to become your own evangelist, without crossing over into carney barker territory (or becoming an insufferable narcissist shouting&mdash;&ldquo;Look at me, look at me!&rdquo;).</p><h3> The key?</h3><p> <br/> Focus on your outcomes: the visceral, emotional transformations you make happen.</p><p> Approach each one as a story. Who was your client? What was his backstory before he met you? How did she know it was time for change? What did you do together that made all the difference? And how is he better off now for that experience?</p><p> Because when you tell these experiences as stories, you&rsquo;ve made the journey human&mdash;relatable.</p><h3> Suddenly, you&rsquo;re not bragging, you&rsquo;re helping.</h3><p> <br/> And the right people will be drawn to you like bees to honey.</p><p> So start working on those stories. Tell them to yourself. Carry them around with you so sharing them at the right times becomes like breathing. Put them on your website and weave them into your content. Share them with your circle and they may just share them with theirs.</p><h3> Being your own evangelist isn&rsquo;t about twisting arms to buy your stuff.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s about changing the world in ways only you can. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Michael Johnston </u>  | ETF Reference</p><p> The ETF field is crowded with analysts and reporters, but a few stand out as particularly worthwhile follows.</p><p> As ETF assets have grown in recent years, so too has the number of reporters and bloggers writing about them. Much of what&rsquo;s purported to cover ETFs is actually general market commentary in disguise, and in most cases any ETF-specific news is a rehashing. Among all the noise, however, there are a number of reporters and analysts who do an excellent job covering the ETF industry and offering up their own research and opinions.</p><p> The 12 experts highlighted here are top-notch resources for news about the industry and in-depth research into the mechanics of exchange-traded products. The list below is presented in alphabetical order by last name.</p><h3> Expert #1: Eric Balchunas</h3><br /><p> Eric is senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg. Armed with all the data resources of Bloomberg &mdash; he&rsquo;s also been responsible for many of the ETF-related features available there &mdash; Eric is in a unique position to analyze the universe of ETFs. His  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/@EricBalchunas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter account  </a> </u>  is also a great resource for ETF data nuggets throughout the day.</p><p> Eric is one of the sharpest minds covering the fund industry. He&rsquo;s also an occasional guest on Bloomberg&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/etf-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETF Report Podcast  </a> </u>  and contributes regularly to Bloomberg&rsquo;s personal finance blog  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/blogs/personal_finance/ventured-gained/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ventured&amp;Gained  </a> </u> .</p><p> You can follow Eric on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/@EricBalchunas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u>  and read him on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ADUgYkp2OlE/eric-balchunas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bloomberg  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Expert #2: Stoyan Bojinov</h3><br /><p> Stoyan is an ETF analyst at  <u>  <a href=\"http://etfdb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETF Database  </a> </u> , one of the largest and most popular ETF sites on the Web.

(the publisher of  <a href=\"http://etfdb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ETFdb.com </a> ).</p><h3> Expert #3: Chris Dieterich</h3><br /><p> Chris had some big shoes to fill when he took over Brendan Conway&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Focus on Funds  </a> </u>  in Barron&rsquo;s in late 2014, but he&rsquo;s upheld this column as an excellent source for ETF information and analysis. Chris includes a little bit of everything in his column, from a morning linkfest, to interesting fund-relating reads, to news about new ETFs and fund changes, to daily roundups of the session&rsquo;s big movers.</p><p> Chris also covers the world of mutual funds in this column, including manager moves and big fund inflows.</p><p> You can follow Chris on  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisdieterich\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u>  and read his column at  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Barron&rsquo;s  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Expert #4: Eric Dutram</h3><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://article.wn.com/view/2014/12/31/Zacks_Investment_Ideas_feature_highlights_Vanguard_Technolog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   WN.com  </a> </u></p><p> Eric is an ETF strategist at Zacks, where he publishes new articles almost daily. Eric&rsquo;s columns are a great source for updates on which ETF strategies are hot, as well as more nuanced analysis of some of the structural features of ETFs. He&rsquo;s also responsible for developing the analytical tools that have become popular among ETF investors.</p><p> Eric also publishes actionable ETF ideas in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zacks.com/etftrader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zacks ETF Trader  </a> </u>  newsletter.</p><p> You can follow Eric on  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericdutram\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u>  and read his articles at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zacks.com/bio/eric-dutram\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zacks  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Expert #5: Deborah Fuhr</h3><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.globaletfawards.com/imagecontentA.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Global ETF Awards  </a> </u></p><p> Formerly the global head of ETF research at BlackRock, Deborah founded consultancy firm  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etfgi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETFGI  </a> </u>  in 2012. Based in London, Deborah and her team are the foremost authority for statistics on the global ETF industry. ETFGI&rsquo;s monthly statistical snapshots highlight noteworthy trends in the ETF space both in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p> Having spent several years with the largest issuer of U.S. ETFs, Deborah has a unique perspective on the industry.

He has a knack for picking up on the storylines that aren&rsquo;t covered elsewhere but that are of interest within the ETF community.</p><p> In addition to reporting (and often breaking) news on fund launches and changes, Trevor frequently identifies potential areas of concern for advisors using ETFs and seeks out opinions from around the industry.</p><p> You can follow Trevor on  <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/trhunnicutt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u>  and read his columns at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/staff/thunnicutt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Investment News  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Expert #7: Dave Nadig</h3><br /><p> Dave Nadig was formerly chief investment officer at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETF.com  </a> </u> , and is now the Director of ETFs at FactSet. (The two companies announced a partnership earlier this year.) He might also be the smartest guy covering the ETF industry. Dave has a long background in the finance industry, so he&rsquo;s well equipped to understand many of the complex and confusing aspects of the exchange-traded structure in general and individual products in particular. He&rsquo;s also eloquent enough to break down these weighty topics into language that even financial advisors can understand.</p><p> Though Dave is a huge fan of ETFs, he doesn&rsquo;t pull any punches when it comes to criticizing what he sees as shortcomings of the industry or flaws with specific products.</p><p> You can follow Dave on  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davenadig\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u>  and continue to read him on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/sections/blog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETF.com  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Expert #8: Michael Rawson</h3><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/AAII-Atlanta/messages/20559011/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meetup  </a> </u></p><p> Michael is one of several contributors to Morningstar&rsquo;s superb  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.morningstar.com/articles/collection/520-etf-specialist.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETF Specialist  </a> </u>  center, a source of continuing education for advisors and individuals using ETFs in their portfolios.</p><p> Michael writes on a wide range of topics, but is particularly insightful in offering advice for achieving the most efficient exposure possible to &ldquo;plain vanilla&rdquo; asset classes such as U.S. equities. The headlines might not be as catchy as those that cover the bizarre and hyper-targeted ETFs out there, but these pieces provide common sense actionable advice that every indexer can actually use.</p><p> You can read Michael at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.morningstar.com/articles/author/1528-michael-rawson-cfa.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Morningstar  </a> </u> , and also catch him in videos from time to time.</p><h3> Expert #9: Ron Rowland</h3><br /><p> In addition to running the popular  <u>  <a href=\"http://investwithanedge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Invest With An Edge  </a> </u>  site, Ron is chief investment officer of Capital Cities Asset Management. Not afraid to dive into the fine print, Ron has repeatedly used his financial expertise to highlight potentially dangerous aspects of ETFs that individual investors may overlook. He&rsquo;s written about the  <u>  real risks of ETNs </u> ,  <u>  actual expense ratios </u>  of MLP products, and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://investwithanedge.com/category/volatility-products\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   extreme risk  </a> </u>  of volatility ETPs.</p><p> Ron also maintains the popular  <u>  <a href=\"http://investwithanedge.com/etf-deathwatch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETF Deathwatch  </a> </u> , a database and newsletter highlighting exchange-traded products deemed to be in danger of closing.

They talk more, opportunity and winners. They even talk low volatility these days.  <br/> <br/> But when they think they are talking to women, they talk about aiming higher, taking more risk, outliving the money, having saved less, working fewer years and being too risk averse. <br/> <br/> Maybe it&rsquo;s coincidence or just plain dumb luck that women are seen as needing help from the mistakes they&rsquo;ve made and men are seen as looking for the next big thing. Maybe it&rsquo;s because for all of its history, the financial services industry has been talking to men &ndash; men advisors anyway. <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s time for the industry to understand the importance of women to its future and learn to reach out to them in positive and confidence-boosting ways.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s time to say to women things like:</h3><li> You know far more about investing than most of us</li><li> You can spot value a mile off and we could all learn more from you</li><li> You are the best partner an advisor can have</li><li> You make your advisor better for everyone else</li><li> You ask questions that need to be answered</li><li> You are the kind of client that we want</li><li> You are important for this generation and the next generation of investors</li><li> You are the role model for your children&rsquo;s future financial success</li><li> You are a better investor because you are an inquisitive client</li><p> <br/> Your important role is to tell your advisor what&rsquo;s important to you &ndash; People invest to achieve a goal not to amass a pile of money</p><p> There are a lot of smart people in the industry and if this becomes a priority for any one of the leaders, this more positive approach in meeting the needs of their female clients will get done.

    "content": "<strong> So long April, hellooooo May.</strong>Saying goodbye to another month can only mean one thing: it&rsquo;s Street $ense time! We stayed local this week and turned to an insider for help with understanding an industry term that has become admittedly vague: financial advisor. Starting her career as an estate attorney turned director of financial planning, we thought Commie Stevens would be perfect to demystify what a financial advisor is and how to choose one. In true Commie fashion, she did not disappoint.<h3> <b>  Q: What is a financial advisor? </b></h3><b> A</b>: &ldquo;Financial advisor&rdquo; has become a catch-all term to describe someone that provides advice related to money. Stock brokers, insurance agents, financial planners, accountants and investment managers all get lumped into this category. The term can be used to describe employees that work for large brokerage firms like Fidelity or Schwab or smaller Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firms. So, the services provided can vary widely in scope.  When choosing an advisor, this &ndash; or any other description &ndash; isn&rsquo;t as important as the services offered and if they&rsquo;re in-line with what you need.<h3> <b>  Q: How do I choose a financial advisor? </b></h3><b> A:</b>Start by asking friends and family for recommendations. Peruse the advisor&rsquo;s website to scope out the services they offer and to get a feel for their approach. Then, call to schedule a meeting to see if they will be a good fit (it should be complimentary).<h3> <b>  Q: What questions should I ask a potential advisor? </b></h3><b> A:</b>Just like any new relationship, before asking questions, you should think about what you&rsquo;re looking for and your deal breakers. Consider making a wish list of items for which you need guidance and a list of things that are important to you. For example, you might want an advisor who is willing to travel to you for meetings or that considers the impact of taxes when making investment decisions.Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s not enough to just ask the questions; you have to also evaluate the responses. My advice is to ask the following questions, keeping a few things in mind:<li> <b>  What services do you provide? </b>   If the response is &ldquo;investment management&rdquo; and you are trying to plan for college and retirement, then it&rsquo;s probably not the right fit. Refer back to your wish list and see how many items the advisor can check off.</li><li> <b>  Are you a Broker-Dealer or a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)? </b>   This question will help determine the advisor&rsquo;s standard of care when making recommendations as they are regulated differently. Read <a href=\"https://beaconpointe.com/ria-or-broker-dealer-whats-the-fiduciary-difference/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RIA or Broker-Dealer: What&rsquo;s the Fiduciary Difference? </a> before your meeting to help determine which structure is more appealing to you. The term &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; may ring a bell because the Department of Labor is working toward extending this standard of care across the broker-dealer space. So, in the future, this distinction may not need to be made but, for now, it&rsquo;s important.</li><li> <b>  What can I expect to pay in fees and/or commissions?  </b> What you want to know here is how much you can expect to pay all-in, including fees for financial planning services (i.e., retirement), investment management, underlying investment expenses, transaction costs and commissions that may apply on certain products. Total costs will vary based on a number of factors, some of which are specific to your situation and possibly out of your advisor&rsquo;s full control. So, be careful when comparing your costs to those paid by others.  Ask yourself if the services being offered are worth the cost. This one is a personal decision.</li>Also, remember that relationships are personal on some level, even in business.<strong> So, while playing the role of interrogator, be aware of the connection you feel (or don&rsquo;t feel) toward the advisor and listen to your gut.</strong>",

In my many days of reading each year, I try very hard to keep up with great business books and I&rsquo;m behind on this one, but want to give a shout-out nonetheless.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Go-Giver-Little-Story-Powerful-Business/dp/159184200X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430946343&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+go+giver+book\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   If you&rsquo;ve not read The Go-Giver  </a> </u>  &ndash; I highly recommend it.  Bob Burg and John David Mann hit a  home run with this message! [And yes, that&rsquo;s a library book! I still check out books at the library and so should you!]</p><h3> For me, the entire book validated why I&rsquo;m in social media.  </h3><p> <br/> The entire premise of social media is to give boldly and then receive.  The amount of clout and leverage that comes from devoting most of my time to teaching and mentoring others has been profound.  Would I consider myself lucky? Absolutely not &ndash; I&rsquo;m leveraged.</p><p> Through my energetic delivery, enthusiastic personality, unbridled curiosity and genuine interest in others, I have been blessed to work with the financial services community in delivering social media in a way that is not intimidating, overwhelming or somehow seems impossible.  Think about your own practice as you read the</p><p> I decided about three years ago that I wanted to have a purpose in life.  I didn&rsquo;t really know what that meant at the time.  I knew I had a very big heart.  I enjoy helping people.  I love financial services and I was pretty darn good at social media. My problem was that I was not combining these things in the right way to uncover my purpose.  Once I did, my whole life changed.  I want you to think about your own practice as you read the5 Laws of Stratospheric Success from this book, which include:</p><li> <strong>  The Law of Value:  </strong>  Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.</li><li> <strong>  The Law of Compensation:  </strong>  Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.</li><li> <strong>  The Law of Influence:   </strong> Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people&rsquo;s interests first.</li><li> <strong>  The Law of Authenticity:  </strong>  The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.</li><li> <strong>  The Law of Receptivity:  </strong>  The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving. <br/>  </li><h3> This is the day we all must STOP KEEPING SCORE.  </h3><p> <br/> I remember in the 80&rsquo;s when everyone was about scratching each other&rsquo;s backs.  So many movies back then were about I did this for you and you&rsquo;re going to do that for me.  That is not the way you look out for others&hellip;and it&rsquo;s definitely not the way to becoming successful or developing your purpose.  You watch out for the other person; you HAVE their back.  Period.  Forget the 50/50 mentality and you make your life about other people.  That&rsquo;s how you find your purpose in life and ultimately your true success.</p><h3> The book also discusses the 3 Universal Reasons for Working which include:</h3><li> <strong>  ​Survive:  </strong>  To meet your basic living needs</li><li> <strong>  Save:   </strong> To go beyond your basic needs and expand your life.</li><li> <strong>  Serve:  </strong>  To make a contribution to the world around you. <br/>  </li><p> Be honest with yourself and ask, &ldquo;Where am I today with this?&rdquo;  If you are stuck in Survival and Save mode, try going right to Serving others and see how that works out long term for you.  For example, if you want to be heard &ndash; how much listening are you doing?  You have to listen to others a lot before they are willing to hear you out.  The book makes this statement, &ldquo;...the cleansing pain of honest self-reflection.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the whole thing right there, folks.</p><p> Get real with yourself. Read this book.  I was absolutely blown away how such a little book had an enormous impact on me.  It validated all my crazy reasons on why I help so many people.</p><h3> Speaking of which, &ldquo;How may I serve you?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>",

    "link": "what-would-yale-do-if-it-was-taxable",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Yale is among the finest learning institutions in the world.  It is known for many great things, but in the investment world it is probably best known for its top performing endowment, which many try to replicate with what is called an endowment model.  What can individuals investors learn from the Yale endowment? Maybe how to not invest if, like most individuals I know, you have to pay taxes.</p><p> Over the past 5-10 years, I have seen a large increase in firms selling ultra-high-net-worth investors (individuals and families who have liquid investible assets excluding real estate of $50 million or more), endowment style investment portfolios and limited partnership fund of funds.</p><p> Why might this initially appear to make sense?  Many ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) investors have no debt, consume a small portion of their assets for annual expenses, and are really investing for future beneficiaires or to be able to give more in the future to charity.  Some have even set up trusts in jurisdictions like Delaware that allow family trusts to run for more than 100 years (so called dynasty trusts).  Because of this, UHNW investors commonly view their time horizon for family trusts in generations, not years or decades.</p><p> What does a trust that is investing over a very long-term timeframe for the benefit of generations to come sound like?  </p><h3> Maybe an endowment?</h3><p> <br/> If some UHNW trusts have characteristics that resemble endowments, and Yale is arguably the best endowment, shouldn&rsquo;t more UHNW portfolios look like Yale?</p><p> Many investment managers and advisors certainly suggest this.  Over the years, I have seen firms craft pitches for UHNW wealth families that sound something like the following:</p><p> &ldquo;You have more money than you can possibly spend in a lifetime and are now really investing for the benefit of generations to come. Because you have such a long-term timeframe and have the access that your success brings, shouldn&rsquo;t you be investing the same way some of the most successful investors in the world invest?  Shouldn&rsquo;t you be investing like Yale in an endowment like model?  The risk-adjusted returns and strategies that we can implement on your behalf using an endowment style limited partnership or approach are compelling.&rdquo;</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the problem with this?</h3><p> <br/> Beyond, in some cases, presentations that are driven by incentives to drive sales of complex strategies with high fees, high margins and high commission charges, at least three problems: fees, performance and taxes</p><p> Every endowment approach I have ever seen has one thing in common with its peers: a sizable allocation to hedge funds.  </p><p> A great deal has been written in academic studies and the media about the high fees associated with hedge funds. More is also starting to surface about hedge fund performance as compared to low cost, simple, diversified portfolios of index funds that have the same historical risk adjusted returns and volatility (feel free to reach out to us for our analysis of this &ndash; my hedge fund friends might de-friend me if I post it publicly).</p><p> Not as much has made the press, however, about what really makes UHNW investing different than endowments, namely, taxes.</p><h3> Yes, taxes.  </h3><p> <br/> Regardless of your political leanings, no one likes writing a big check to the IRS, but the IRS is a fact we cannot avoid.</p><p> Recent tax law changes have made the subject of taxes even more important as it relates to investments. Tax law changes that became effective January 1, 2013 include a top short-term gain rate of 39.6%, a long-term gain rate of 20.0%, an additional 3.8% tax on net investment income (the Medicare tax) and an effective additional 1.2% rate increase due to the phase-out of deductions for top-bracket taxpayers (the Pease phase-out).  All of this combines to create a 44.6% tax on short-term gains and ordinary income, and a 25.0% tax on long-term gains and dividend income.  And this is only taking into account federal taxes.  Many states such as California, which has one of the largest collections of UHNW individuals in the United States, impose a substantial additional tax burden.</p><p> When I am helping UHNW investors free up funds around tax time to pay bills due for large realized gains on hedge funds, I often raise words of caution about these investments.</p><p> Endowment model investment presentations, which normally include sizable allocations to hedge funds, are complex, well done, and often presented by well educated and well heeled professionals.  The pitches can be impressive and hard to resist.  What they often do not point out, however, is that allocations to hedge funds often generate large short-term gains, which now carry with them a 44.6% federal tax or reduction of return for taxable investors.</p><h3> So, what has made me write of this subject now?  </h3><p> <br/> Well, the dreaded April 15th tax date has recently passed, so conversations about this subject with our UHNW investors are top of mind.</p><p> In addition, credit must be given to a tax aware investment firm in California,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aperiogroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Aperio Group  </a> </u> .  I shamelessly took the title of this post from one of their recent papers.  The full research report can be found at the link below.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/What-Would-Yale-Do1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What Would Yale Do If It Was Taxable?  </a> </u></p><p> Inspiration also comes from the long-time Chief Investment Officer of the Yale endowment, David Swensen. Swensen is considered one of the most successful investors in the world and, based on his use of non-traditional investments such as hedge funds, a major contributor to the endowment investment model. Following thoughts from Swensen&rsquo;s first book in 2000, Pioneering Portfolio Management, many UHNW advisors started promoting the endowment model.  The UHNW investment world eagerly embraced this new &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; approach and yet, going on 15 years later, still seems to be forgetting the fact that Swensen&rsquo;s book was designed for tax-exempt investors.</p><p> Even though Yale has generated top returns for its beneficiaries through the use of hedge funds, what does Swensen, like many other successful investors such as Warren Buffett, suggest for taxable investors?</p><h3> Index funds.</h3><p> <br/> Why?  Well, maybe the following quote from his second book (this one for taxable investors), Unconventional Success says it best:</p><p> &ldquo;The management of taxable&hellip;assets without considering the consequences of trading activity represents a&hellip;little considered scandal.  A serious fiduciary with responsibility for taxable assets recognizes that only extraordinary circumstances justify deviation from a simple strategy&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Swensen&rsquo;s quote is powerful and is book is very well done.  When you have time, I encourage a read (see the link below).</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=WRLNZwZRRLsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">   Unconventional Success  </a> </u></p><p> What Aperio has done better than almost anyone else I have seen is provide sophisticated evidence to counter some of the sophisticated endowment style presentations.  Their research suggests that when you properly account for the tax drag, hedge funds should have little, if any, place inside taxable portfolios.</p><p> The Aperio study is lengthy, but I would encourage you to click on the link above or at the bottom of this post to at least take a scan.  They used well-accepted analytical processes and collected data from multiple third party sources, including an independent study the Commonfund and the National Association of College and University Business Offices (NACUBO).  Every year NACUBO releases detailed information on the asset allocations, performance and rankings of U.S. endowments.  If you want to know more about how your own alma mater is invested, you can view a summary of the report at the following:</p><p> <u>  NACUBO: 2014 Commonfund Study of Endowments </u></p><p> As we try consistently to do, versus going on our about own views, below are quotes and charts to consider from the Aperio research.  Aperio uses the term Absolute Return as a proxy for hedge funds.  Notice the allocations to Absolute Return and even to more traditional active equity managers in the &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; and &ldquo;blue&rdquo; shaded columns.</p><p> <strong>  Aperio Table 3:  After-Tax Returns and Weights for Yale (low correlation HF index) </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-09-at-8.13.53-AM.png\" width=\"613\"/></p><p> &ldquo;The Yale P/T (pre-tax) column presupposes an investor who uses active management for public equities.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The Yale A/T (after-tax) with Active Equity (see yellow column) shows the weights of the Yale portfolio with the equity allocation available only through active strategies&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The Yale A/T (after-tax) with Indexed Equity (see blue column) shows the portfolio under the same assumptions used in the yellow column, but with indexed equities now available.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Given that an investor now has to pay taxes on what had been a tax-exempt portfolio, suddenly active equity and absolute return (hedge fund) allocations become far less attractive.&rdquo;</p><p> Yes, if you look carefully at the chart, the Aperio research suggests that you should have zero allocation to active managers and hedge funds, and this assumes that you only have hedge funds with low correlation to equities, which provide diversification benefits.  </p><p> Many hedge funds have relatively high correlation to equities (a well respected hedge fund index, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite has a 0.88 correlation to equities), which makes the case against using them for diversification even less attractive.  Below is a quote from Aperio on the results of their analysis when using hedge funds with high correlation to equities.</p><p> &ldquo;If a hedge fund strategy reflects the risk patterns of the HFRI index, with its higher correlation to equities, then the model never allocates anything to hedge funds&rdquo;</p><p> Versus just modeling Yale&rsquo;s portfolio, Aperio also used data from the previously mentioned Commonfund and NACUBO study of all U.S. endowments.  Below is a chart and quotes from what they found using this approach.</p><p> <strong>  <img alt=\"\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-09-at-8.14.24-AM.png\" width=\"627\"/> </strong></p><p> &ldquo;The outcome for average endowments from NACUBO (National Association of College and University Business Offices) ends up with after-tax weights fairly similar to those for the Yale endowment (see yellow column).  The high tax penalty for active management prevents the NACUBO model from holding any equity at all when only active equity is available.  The blue column shows how with equity provided through traditional indexing, the outcome looks very similar to the old pension standby of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, with a light sprinkling of alternatives.&rdquo;</p><h3> Where does this all leave us as it relates to the title of this blog?</h3><p> <br/> First, as is always the case, the assumptions that Aperio or any other researcher uses are key.  I have looked at the research in depth and believe the underlying assumptions are reasonable, but as with anything, results will vary based on the actual investments that anyone might make.</p><p> Second, the Aperio research does suggest that if you use tax-effecient index strategies, such as the ones that they provide, you can allocate more to certain types of hedge funds that have low correlation to equities.  I am a little suspect, however, about how much value can be added in terms of tax efficiency over and above the extreme tax efficiency of index funds, but I welcome feedback on this, and encourage you to read the full Aperio report yourself.</p><h3> Finally, if you are a taxable investor, don&rsquo;t be sold complex strategies that don&rsquo;t factor in taxes.</h3><p> <br/> All of this continues to lead us to recommend that all investors, small and large, maintain a high percentage of keep-it-simple, low fee, fully transparent, tax efficient investments.</p><p> What types of investments should more UHNW investors use to try to achieve solid returns like Yale?</p><p> The evidence continues to point to index funds.</p><p> * In the Aperio research, bonds are assumed to be taxable for the pre-tax allocation and tax-exempt municipals for the after-tax portfolios.  All distributions from tax-exempt bonds are assumed to be tax-exempt, i.e. possible capital gains are ignored.  </p><p> Note: P/T = Pre-Tax, A/T = After-Tax.  The above weights and returns are hypothetical and are not based on actual investments.  Cash has been constrained in optimization to show a weight of zero.

    "content": "<p> In my last post, I talked about the seven things not to do with your marketing budget. ( <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/business-sense/7-things-not-to-do-with-your-marketing-budget/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  If you missed it, you can read it here. </a> ) So this week I thought it would be a good idea to offer some recommendations for the ways small businesses SHOULD be spending marketing budgets to get the most bang for your buck. There are so many effective ways to allocate your marketing dollars and whether you select just one of these or combine several of them for a well-assembled marketing strategy, I think you&rsquo;ll find these to be well worth your consideration to reach your goals and see real results.</p><h3> 1. Social Media</h3><p> Cost = $0.00</p><p> Woo hoo! First thing on the list doesn&rsquo;t even cost you a dime! Well, not exactly. Social media will cost you in soft dollars at a minimum and well worth the human capital it requires to execute. Brands that show up on social channels and make social media part of their marketing strategy see an increase in brand exposure, lead generation, and new customers. Go here to read  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-roi-stats?__hstc=231228160.ea9d5389ff079f05df99fe57aedb0b26.1430665062675.1430768250743.1431185257192.5&amp;__hssc=231228160.3.1431185257192&amp;__hsfp=1108624085\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   16 Stats that Prove Social Media Isn&rsquo;t a Passing Fad  </a> </u>  by Hubspot. If you think it costs too much to hire a full-time dedicated employee to leverage social media or an agency that can manage this piece for you, I&rsquo;d argue that it might just cost you too much not to.</p><h3> 2. Website</h3><p> Cost = varies</p><p> I know this may seem crazy, but I still know of small businesses that don&rsquo;t have a website, so therefore it must make my list. Websites are not optional. If people can&rsquo;t find you online, you are intentionally sabotaging your ability to grow your business. If people can&rsquo;t find you, they can&rsquo;t become your customer. Having a digital footprint and a way for people to learn about you and your business is very definitely worth the dollars you will spend on it. And don&rsquo;t forget to make sure you have a mobile site, as Google is going to favor and promote mobile friendly sites over non. Read the news here:  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32380223\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Google Search Changes Will Promote Mobile-Friendly Sites  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 3. Visual Content</h3><p> Cost = $0.00 to $20,000</p><p> Videos, photographs and graphics are a very necessary part of your marketing mix and valuable content. They help you show your brand&rsquo;s story and they offer a very engaging way for you to add value to your audience and increase engagement rates. Don&rsquo;t neglect the opportunity to invite your audience into an inside reel of your brand. And don&rsquo;t miss the chance to do more for your audience than talk at them. Showing is more powerful than telling. Therefore, visual content is an investment you want to make and it has a very long shelf-life. People just love videos. Hubspot shares in a recent post that last year, the amount of video from people and brands in Facebook&rsquo;s News feed increased 3.6X year-over-year (source). They also highlight that tweets with images receive 18% more clicks, 89% more favorites and 150% more retweets ( <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-power-of-twitters-new-expanded-images-and-how-to-make-the-most-of-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   source  </a> </u> ). Holy cow! That&rsquo;s a lot of upside visual content brings.  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy?__hstc=231228160.ea9d5389ff079f05df99fe57aedb0b26.1430665062675.1430768250743.1431185257192.5&amp;__hssc=231228160.3.1431185257192&amp;__hsfp=1108624085\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Get all 17 stats about visual content here  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 4. Written Content</h3><p> Cost = $0.00+</p><p> Blogging is a great way for small businesses to get on the map and start adding value right away. And if you are willing to write, it doesn&rsquo;t have to cost you anything except your time. What a great line item on your budget! Companies that blog receive 97% more links to their website and B2B marketers report that blogging has resulted in 67% more leads than those who do not ( <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blogging-in-2015?__hstc=231228160.ea9d5389ff079f05df99fe57aedb0b26.1430665062675.1430768250743.1431185257192.5&amp;__hssc=231228160.3.1431185257192&amp;__hsfp=1108624085\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   source  </a> </u> ). Blogging is improves your website performance, increases your ranking for certain keywords and starts to establish trust between you and your reader. If you decide to hire freelancers or a content agency to help you write content, that is where costs can enter into the picture. Always ask for samples of a writer&rsquo;s work before hiring someone. Choosing the right writer has a lot to do with style and their ability to internalize your brand and voice. Pick carefully if you go that route.</p><h3> 5. Marketing Automation</h3><p> Cost = $250/month+</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you are always looking for ways to streamline your processes and be more efficient. You can&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t) automate personalization, you can automate a host of other marketing activities that make you more responsive and better at adding value to your ideal customer. Look into solutions that allow you to set up automatic follow-ups so that you can not only provide a consistent brand experience, but ensure that your ideal customers have the best service even before they become a client. Automation software usually also includes CRM (client relationship management) capabilities to help you manage new and existing contacts. I personally use  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/?__hstc=231228160.ea9d5389ff079f05df99fe57aedb0b26.1430665062675.1430768250743.1431185257192.5&amp;__hssc=231228160.3.1431185257192&amp;__hsfp=1108624085\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hubspot  </a> </u>  as my marketing automation solution. Other great options I recommend for small business owners include  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.infusionsoft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Infusionsoft  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.act-on.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Act-On  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 6. Social Publishing Platforms</h3><p> Cost = $0.00 to $830.00</p><p> Small businesses should be using a social publishing platform like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buffer  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite  </a> </u>  to streamline and organize your social sharing. These are powerful scheduling tools that allow you to set-up your online content ahead of time and send at a predetermined time. What&rsquo;s most important is that these platforms also track the analytics of the posts you publish so you know what posts performed best. These services have free versions, but if you upgrade your subscription to a paid account, you get a whole lot of valuable insights into the performance of your posts and aggregate results. Small businesses should use the free version at a minimum so that you can easily schedule your posts and make life easier.</p><h3> 7.  Social Listening</h3><p> Cost =$0.00</p><p> You need to have your ear to the ground and keep a pulse on your market. People are talking all day, every day online and they may be saying something about your industry or brand. Put your business in a position of awareness so that you can monitor perceptions and respond to opportunities to engage. Social listening tools like Google filters and  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.mention.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mention.net  </a> </u>  are very helpful.  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-listening-dashboard/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Go here for a comprehensive article on social listening  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 8. Market Research</h3><p> Cost = $0.00+</p><p> Market research is always looked at as this overly expensive thing. Yet, it is exactly what helps you to better understand your market, customer and future customers. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have a $10,000 budget for research, but what&rsquo;s preventing you from sitting down with your customers and asking them for some feedback about customer experience or new ideas? I think it is incredibly valuable to have objective customer data to not only help drive marketing messages, but future product or service development if your business is considering on expanding any of its offerings. Data is wonderful to have to make informed decisions about your business and can really aid in executing smart marketing strategies. Better to know too much, than not enough.  <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/content/do-your-market-research\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SBA also offers resources to small businesses on market research  </u>  . </a>  These resources help with external factors.</p><h3> 9. Digital Advertising</h3><p> Cost = Varies</p><p> Digital advertising is a special opportunity, because it allows you to strategically place your brand in front of your ideal customer. You can then track its effectiveness in delivering quality leads to your business with real results. There is nothing unknowing about digital advertising and it follows the consumer&rsquo;s preferences. It can honestly seem kind of creepy and even seem a little stalkerish, but at least digital ads offer a customized and more personalized experience for the audience.  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242393\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Here is a great article in Entrepreneur about the latest trends in digital advertising  </u>  . </a>  This may very well be the line item you want to splurge on as a small business. It is more costly than some of the other items on this list, but if done correctly, can have compelling results on your bottom line, especially if combined with other strategies like blogging as an example.</p><h3> 10. Facebook</h3><p> Cost = $5.00+</p><p> For as little as $5.00, you can boost a Facebook post that helps target your post in front of your ideal customers. It is a low-cost, high-return investment that I encourage every small business to take advantage of (if your audience is using Facebook). Facebook advertising is another way to promote your business page and drive more quality leads to your business. Whether we like it or not, Facebook is a great way to reach your customers and they continue to make it very affordable to do so.  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/facebook-advertising\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Here&rsquo;s an arsenal of Facebook advertising blog posts you can mine through for more information  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 11. Gratitude Giveaways</h3><p> Cost = Varies</p><p> I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what else to call this line item. I think it is worth having a portion of your budget allocated for the individualized expenses you may want to make. These could be anything from branded stickers to gift cards to another awesome item. Saying &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; is one thing, but showing thank you with a gesture is way more memorable. Who doesn&rsquo;t like receiving &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in the mail? Buffer does a great job at this as a regular practice. At random it seems, they will send a nice hand-written thank you note with something branded with Buffer on it for being part of their community. That is freaking awesome. People then post pictures of themselves with Buffer stickers, hats, t-shirts and mugs. Again, it&rsquo;s a really low cost relative the high value of building customer advocacy that amplifies their brand beyond their one happy customer. It&rsquo;s a nice thing to do and the marketing benefits are huge.</p><p> I think the trick here is to know what your business and marketing goals are. Write them down. Next, make sure you are clear on your brand story, who you are and the value you bring to your customers. Finally, remember your audience. Think very specifically about who you are trying to attract to your business and then throw your budget behind the tactics that will best help you reach your goals and your ideal customer&rsquo;s needs. I realize that is a very CliffNotes version (remember those!? I&rsquo;m totally dating myself) of how you can begin your marketing strategy, but it is the starting place that will help you make smart investments with your marketing budget.</p><p> <strong>  Cheers to you and your growing business! </strong></p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> Technology has the power to awe, captivate and inspire.  </h3><p> <br/> It also has the capacity to make us more efficient and free up what is our most precious resource - time. So, while eMoney and the other providers at eMoney's inaugural summit showed off some slick technology and delivered the wow factor, the real message attending advisers are taking home is that eMoney and its partners are looking to do more than provide practice management and financial planning tools.  They want to use big data, seamlessly integrated technology and better training to help advisers deliver better service in less time.</p><p> During the conference, it was repeated that technology was not there to dis-intermediate the adviser, but to make their job easier and save time. Technology to help make better decisions, technology to help facilitate client discussions, technology to better understand a client's risk capacity versus risk tolerance, etc., etc.  Again, all of the above promises to save time.</p><p> And what should adviser's do with all that spare time? Edmond Walters, CEO of eMoney, suggested that his platform could earn back a month of time each year for advisers, perhaps to spend with family or to spend on growing their business. It wasn't the last time business development made its way into the conversation. In more than one breakout presentation, the speakers addressed the idea of lead generation for advisers. Many vendors, like BizEquity and MoneyGuidePro, touted tools and ideas to support lead generation in the exhibit hall. </p><p> Most interesting to me was that many conversations with advisers attending talked about the lead generation and savvy selling they hoped the most recent advances could help them with - even though the utility of the represented tools and products goes far beyond that. The tech providers I heard didn't shy away from the connection the advisers were making and often took the opportunity to demonstrate how their offering saved time.</p><p> As tech providers rush to claim a role within the lead generation and business development piece of an adviser's practice, a few things need to be brought front and center:</p><h3> 1) Financial advice is still a referral business. </h3><p> <br/> If an existing customer of a financial advisory firm or a robo-advisory reports to his or her friend a positive experience, that can make all the difference.  Advisers have to think about how they can change their client experience and client communications to excite clients to talk about their own experience.</p><h3> 2) Fitbit didn't kill the personal trainer and robo-advisers won't kill (the good) financial advisers.  </h3><p> <br/> Health and wellness apps and tools have taken off in popularity, giving individuals the capacity to monitor their own fitness goals and measure their diets and physical output. At the same time, the business of personal training and fitness classes has never been more robust. Financial advisers have to realize that the arrival of new tech tools will bring in a new batch of customers previously unengaged by the industry.</p><h3> 3) Are you using the data at your fingertips to its fullest potential?  </h3><p> <br/> No doubt that the latest integrations of software can help you make better financial planning decisions and support portfolio management, but that same data could help you identify new business opportunities. Do your referral spikes coincide with your periodic client review meetings?  Do you have clients from a common employer that are running into similar financial issues? There are so many things to look for and still more that the latest technology promises to push to you.</p><h3> 4) The added time will open up doors for more business development time,</h3><p> <br/> but what will you do to make those new connections?  Congratulations, you've successfully integrated all the technology into your practice and you've picked up a free day each week for marketing and business development. So, what now?  How are you communicating with your target audiences? What are you doing to make sure your firm is more well-known in your community, within the offices of major employers in your area and among current and prospective referral sources? You could package up some \"off the shelf\" content and filter it through your CRM in hopes that your clients share it with friends.  Or, you could go on a limb and marry up a contemporary communications program with your whizbang technology to turn prospects' heads and engage them uniquely in who you are and what your specific expertise might be.  </p><p> The presenters at the eMoney Summit were on to something in relating to the lead generation and business development need advisory firms have, but the tools only give advisers time to face that business development challenge.  It's what they do with the time that will determine which firms will sink or swim in the tech-enabled financial advice world.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Whenever there&rsquo;s a crisis, it&rsquo;s good to have an emergency plan, and when there&rsquo;s a financial crisis, it&rsquo;s good to have a financial emergency plan. When you&rsquo;ve thought through a plan, it&rsquo;s less likely that panic &ndash; or other &ldquo;behavioral mistakes&rdquo; &ndash; will lead you to react in ways you may be regretting for a long time.</p><p> While most investors say they&rsquo;ll continue to hold on to their investments when there&rsquo;s a sharp downturn (and many even say that they&rsquo;ll add money when their investments go down), data tells a far different story. In December 2008, right as the market was near its lowest point, investors pulled out a whopping $10.6 billion from equity mutual funds alone.</p><p> Panicking during market bottoms is a form of &ldquo;behavioral bias&rdquo; that can have a devastating effect on financial health. While the S&amp;P 500 has averaged around 10% a year, costly behavioral mistakes cause many individual investors to significantly  <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/11621555/1/average-investor-20-year-return-astoundingly-awful.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  miss those gains. </a>  That&rsquo;s because, despite good advice, people still tend to put money in the stock market as it rises and pull money out as the market falls. The result: many investors buy  <a href=\"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/are-we-buying-high-all-over-again/?scp=1&amp;sq=buy%20low%20stocks&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=1#sthash.kSv3JRiw.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\">  at market tops </a>  and sell at market bottoms.</p><p> While none of us are immune to behavioral biases, there are several things we can do to help avoid costly mistakes.</p><h3> 1.  Learn From the Past</h3><p> <br/> The first step is to understand that market declines are a normal part of investing and resist the urge to panic!</p><p> While the S&amp;P has historically returned almost 10% annually since the 1960s, those returns are not consistent. One year the market could be up 20% and the next it could decline 12%! To make the ride even bumpier: the market also has streaks where returns decline for several consecutive years. That&rsquo;s when investors often begin to panic and pull their money out. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s usually the worst time to do so, and when investors often should be increasing their investments instead.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-09-at-9.25.17-AM.png\" width=\"541\"/></p><p> Although the market can move up and down in the course of a year, or several years, it has historically trended upwards over longer periods of time (10 or 20 years.) So if your investment horizon is longer than just a few years, remember that it&rsquo;s likely the market will  <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recover its losses </a>  &ndash; and then some &ndash; over time.</p><p> Understanding that the U.S. stock market bounces back after its declines is a helpful first step in creating &ldquo;un-biased&rdquo; financial habits!</p><h3> 2.  Understand that Accepting Lower Returns May be Okay</h3><p> <br/> Generally speaking, younger investors have more years ahead of them to invest. That means they are often able to put a higher percentage of their money in stocks and a very low, or even zero, percentage in bonds. How much you allocate to stocks will depend on factors such as your own investment objectives and your ability to tolerate risk.</p><p> If you know that you&rsquo;re prone to panicking during market declines, however, you may want to keep your portfolio in more conservative investments than your age and investment horizon would normally indicate.</p><p> It&rsquo;s much better to be a bit more conservative and hold on to your investments during market downturns, than to buy riskier assets and sell during market crashes!</p><h3> 3.  Speak with a Professional</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re like most Americans, chances are you spend more time researching your next car than researching your investments!</p><p> Investing can be a difficult &ndash; and sometimes dry &ndash; subject. Learning about the history of the stock market, your own risk tolerance, and behavioral biases that can trip you up is challenging for most people and probably something you don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on.</p><p> That&rsquo;s where a trusted financial planner can help.</p><p> A good financial planner can help guide you along the path in planning for your own financial goals; explain difficult concepts; help you discover your own risk tolerance; recommend appropriate investments based on those risk tolerances; and help you avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><p> A good financial planner also understands the history of the market and knows that, while bull markets don&rsquo;t last forever, declines are generally temporary as well. Knowing that, and having a plan tailored to your specific financial goals will help you to avoid panicking when markets go south, and avoid making the behavioral mistakes that ruin so many people&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Once upon a time customer service meant more than pressing 2 to wait (and wait and wait) for &ldquo;the next available representative.&rdquo; Companies valued those who bought their goods and services and went the proverbial extra mile to make them happy. Today we&rsquo;re more likely to hear about a company that&rsquo;s ripped off its customers. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Failing to make your clients happy is more than a shame. </strong> It&rsquo;s slow-motion corporate suicide. If you want to make it in today&rsquo;s crowded, recession-wracked market, you absolutely must create clients and customers who rave about your company the way they would their favorite sports team.  <br/>      <br/> Obviously, making raving fans out of your clients is easier said than done. If it were easy, then corporate giants that have plenty of money to throw at such a concept would be overrun with happy clients. <br/>      <br/> Following are two key marketing principles for getting clients to go wild about you!</p><h3> 1st Principle: What Are YOU Doing That No One Else Is Doing? </h3><p> <br/> In order to gain exposure, it helps to be or to offer something unique&mdash;or do something that no one else dares. It&rsquo;s true that standing out from the crowd is probably the riskiest of the five principles. However, it may be equally risky to run a conservative, &ldquo;under‐the‐radar&rdquo; firm these days&mdash;you risk becoming an anachronism. While successful firms stick to their values, they also find ways to be so exciting that people don&rsquo;t have a choice but to pay attention&hellip;and buy. </p><h3> 2nd Principle: Focus Your Marketing on Benefits, Results, and a Call to Action. </h3><p> <br/> Another way to gain success is to ensure you are answering the question, What&rsquo;s really in it for me? for your clients. Too many businesses accentuate the features of their products or services rather than the benefits&mdash;what your clients really care about. &ldquo;Open 24 Hours&rdquo; is a feature. Benefits are value statements about the features of a product or service, with an emphasis on what the customer gets. For example, a benefit might be that a product makes you look slimmer or saves lots of money on gas. Too many companies leave it up to their prospects to figure out the benefits of their products or services.  <br/>      <br/> Perhaps more than ever before people want to do business with those they feel they can trust. They are attracted to businesses they feel will go out of their way to provide them the absolute best products or services available. And the absolute best way to elicit that trust in prospects is by having clients who cheer you on at every turn. <strong>  So, don&rsquo;t waste another second waiting to develop a marketing plan that will influence your clients to go wild for you. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Kindergarten teachers know it, so why don&rsquo;t the leaders of professional services firms know it and use it?</p><h3> We tend to get the behaviour we reward repeatedly.</h3><p> <br/> I have been reminded of this simple concept several times in recent weeks.  In one instance it was watching a previously excellent professional run amok and engage in an increasingly erratic fashion, eventually inflicting permanent damage on his firm. In another, I watched a firm struggling to get a grip on precisely how they should reward a fairly large crew of pretty good performers. Both firms had forgotten the basic concept that Kindergarten teachers know and use all too well.</p><p> In the first shambolic example, the firm had created a system whereby a hard-charging and enthusiastic professional was being entirely remunerated for the time spent inside the business &ldquo;fixing it&rdquo;.  Guess what?  More and more things needed time spent on them, and more and more things suddenly needed fixing&hellip;and the hours mounted.  So more money was paid over&hellip;.and the cycle repeated itself ad nauseum.  In just a few short months the professional believed that the more time spent worrying over everybody else&rsquo;s jobs, the better the business would become.</p><p> What actually happened was disenfranchised staff and colleagues throughout the rest of the business, less focus on the individual&rsquo;s real skill set and abilities which could enhance the firms prospects, and a much much higher demand for money from &ldquo;the Rock Star&rdquo; who &ldquo;was fixing everything&rdquo;.  People began disengaging, or leaving, placing further financial pressure on the firm which in turn required more time at a now higher price to fix everything&hellip;.and you can guess how that one played out.  A shambles.  The Rock Star is becoming Last Man Standing.</p><p> Lack of appropriate control mechanisms for sure, but fundamentally the wrong behaviour and focus was being rewarded.  The business is now officially dying.</p><h3> The second example is far more uplifting, and is very much a &ldquo;story in progress&rdquo;.</h3><p> <br/> It is a well established professional services business with superb internal controls and management, with clear understanding on what every person&rsquo;s primary role and value to the organisation is.  It has a genuine &ldquo;team&rdquo; approach, where the attitude is the &ldquo;sum of the whole is greater than the individual parts&rdquo;.</p><p> While the team is (generally) performing very capably, and at higher level than most competitors, there is an inherent dissatisfaction &ndash; they believe they can, and should, do better.  However there is a need to tread carefully, as the existing culture is an excellent one and the people are performing well already.  Management have thought very carefully about what behaviours they value, and which behaviours support their culture and values prior to putting together additional rewards and recognition.  Most importantly perhaps, management understand that recognition IS a form of reward.</p><p> The end result is a reasonably simple system that focusses on 3-5 key activities that drive results for each position.  A little like the old &ldquo;20 points per day&rdquo; process &ndash; though with a touch more sophistication to it.  Complete the particular activities for your role on a daily basis and accumulate points&hellip;and everyone who hits their own benchmark number gets rewarded the same as everyone else in the organisation (no matter their job) who has hit their benchmark number too.  Those who are consistently performing are recognised as leaders and role models, and given extra kudo&rsquo;s as such.</p><p> There are multiple people in the organisation with similar jobs, but then there are others with very different jobs too.  An excellent rewards system focuses on the actual job that each individual was brought on to do&hellip;there is no separation of those who are revenue generators, or those who are service or admin oriented.  Each is part of the team for a reason and has a role to play.  Each team member plays their part and is recognised and rewarded for doing so very well.</p><h3> The result?</h3><p> <br/> A co-operative and positive culture chasing success and higher performance.</p><h3> The lesson?  </h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t underestimate the importance of which behaviours you give recognition to, and reward.  Some will kill your business&hellip;.some will make your business.  Reward the right behaviours well.</p>",

    "content": "<p> You've seen a \"one-size-fits-all\" garment before, haven't you? A T-shirt perhaps, or even worse, a pair of underwear?</p><p> We all know it's a lie when we see it. There's not a chance that piece of clothing will fit all.</p><p> I suppose they can get away with that marketing phrase because common sense tells us it isn't true. We don't sue them for false advertising. We simply think \"Ha. I won't fit in that,\" and we walk away.</p><p> If only such common sense prevailed when it came to investing. Alas, it doesn't.</p><h3> Every day we are bombarded with one-size-fits-all investing advice.</h3><li> Buy gold, short oil, sell bonds, buy stocks.</li><li> Next day; sell gold, buy oil, buy bonds, sell stocks.</li><li> Next day; buy this stock now.</li><li> Next day; buy this fund now.</li><li> Next day; forget all the prior days' advice. Buy this super uber-managed fund and they'll do all the trading for you. <br/>  </li><p> Why is it people read this stuff and believe that the advice applies to them? Do you think the person who wrote it knows anything about your financial goals and the time frame over which you need to accomplish them?</p><p> Here's the problem: some investment recommendations have a shelf life of a few seconds; others a day, a week, a month, a year, or a decade.</p><p> Some traders have a very specific job to do such as hedge the price of oil, because perhaps they work for an oil company, or hedge interest rates because perhaps they work for a mortgage lender or bank. They may write about their work and offer specific commentary about the part of the market they follow.</p><p> Some investment managers build portfolios around risk/return metrics of one month; for example they might have the goal of achieving the return of the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SPX, +1.35% </a>   with less volatility and they measure that on a month-to-month basis. They may be excellent at achieving this goal, but outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a month-to-month risk-adjusted basis is completely irrelevant to the personal financial goals of most investors that I know.</p><p> Some portfolios are built around one-year risk/return metrics, others around a five-year outcome, or a 10-year outcome.</p><p> Pension funds have to take an even longer term view: they must deliver income to thousands for their lifetimes. They have a time frame and investment objective that extends far beyond the average lifespan of one human.</p><p> So, do you suppose an article written by a day trader might have a completely different point of view than one written by a pension fund manager?</p><p> Just the other day someone brought me a proposal put together by an investment firm who was comparing their proposed allocation model and use of alternative investments to the way a major Ivy League endowment fund invests. What was implied was \"Look, we invest the way endowment funds invest. So it must be great.\" The person who brought me the proposal wanted my thoughts.</p><h3> My thoughts were as follows:</h3><li> An endowment fund has an infinite lifetime. You don't. </li><li> Alternative investments are highly illiquid. An endowment fund has numerous other assets to use when they need liquidity. You don't. </li><li> Alternative investments and the entire proposed strategy are completely tax inefficient. An endowment funds doesn't have to worry about this. You do. <br/>  </li><p> When you read market commentary, a proposal, or online advice you have to take a step back and ask, \"Does this have anything to with my personal financial goals?\"</p><p> Think about your goals. If you're 40, the money in your 401(k) or IRA has a 20-year time horizon. Your primary investment goal is maximizing the value of that account by the time you reach 60 or 65.</p><p> If you're 60 and about to retire you have an entirely different objective. Your primary investment goal is achieving a consistent income for the rest of your life.</p><p> Do you suppose the portfolio designed to achieve the 40 year old's goals might look quite different than the one designed to achieve the 60 year old's goals? Yet both seem to be reading the same online investment advice and think it applies to them.</p><p> And what on earth does the price of oil tomorrow, or the price of gold in a week have to do with achieving those goals? Absolutely nothing.</p><h3> One size certainly doesn't fit all. Remember that.</h3>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> How often do you see TGIF pictures or updates posted on your social media accounts by friends and colleagues? Before a new week can get off to a great start, people are already wishing away the remaining four days of the work week in anticipation of the weekend. I know because I used to be one of those people. Between doing the job of two people or more during the day, running my business after-hours, being mommy, wife etc., I often wished for a professional break where I could spend time with my family, travel and pursue other interests.</p><h3> Why Are So Many People Lusting For The Weekend?</h3><p> <br/> In one word, people are exhausted. According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/\" target=\"_blank\">   CDC  </a> </u> , 50-70 million US adults have some sort of sleep or wakefulness disorder. Many people are handling more than their share both personally and professionally. With technology keeping us connected around-the-clock, the divide between our professional and personal lives continue to be blurred.</p><p> When all of these factors begin to affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity, and engagement we may need to look to the unconventional- a workplace sabbatical. Sabbaticals are quite common in the academic arena. They often use them to allow staff to reinvigorate their research interests by taking time away from their current duties. We have all reached our tipping point at one time or another- where everything in life seemed to be converging. Plainly, you wished you could take a break.</p><h3> What is a Workplace Sabbatical?</h3><p> <br/> A workplace sabbatical would provide eligible full-time employees with a pre-determined schedule for taking extended time off to pursue personal interests or to be with family. It can be paid or unpaid depending on how you decide to implement it. Obviously, paid leave is far more enticing than no pay at all. In return, you come back to your job and responsibilities with a fresh perspective and renewed purpose.</p><p> The shining example for workplace sabbaticals of the moment is the IT software company called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Autodesk  </a> </u> .  Autodesk offers their employees six weeks of paid time off in addition to already accrued vacation and holidays every four years. This is extremely generous. It&rsquo;s no wonder they made it to #10 on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.greatplacetowork.net/best-companies/worlds-best-multinationals/profiles-of-the-winners/1531-10-autodesk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Great Place to Work Institute&rsquo;s list  </a> </u>  for the&rdquo;World&rsquo;s Best Multinationals Employers&rdquo;.</p><p> Not only would your employees be recharged by virtue of a sabbatical, but they would be very clear that their company cares about their well-being and not just the bottom-line. In the interim, your employees find untapped talents, new inspiration for work projects, and some much needed rest and relaxation. You both benefit, because they bring all of their pearls of wisdom back to the organization.</p><p> This is not about giving extra time off just to give it out. It is about employers investing in their employee&rsquo;s well-being which is probably more important than the actual work. If your employees are not in the right frame of mind and spirit to produce, the business suffers. It is not only a retention tool, but it also allows our employees to unplug and switch gears.  As professionals, we often misjudge the importance of downtime in the face of doing what we need to do. We are not robots. Worker Burnout is real and at an all-time high.</p><h3> Did You Know? </h3><p> <br/> According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/employees/the-hidden-costs-of-workplace-stress/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2013 Intuit article  </a> </u> , Stress is costing US employers 300 billion per year. Additionally as a country, we get a 69 for health and wellness and a 75 for foundations of well-being according to the  <u>  Social Progress Index </u> . Sweden, Norway, and Finland are just a few countries that are ahead of us where it regards overall societal well-being.</p><p> Clearly, we will have to do more than offer a few days PTO; if we are going to push our workers to the max. Ensuring a sustainable and productive workforce in the present and future will require new ways of inspiring our employees.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/course/gaining-commitments\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gaining commitments  </a> </u> : it can be a natural part of consultative sales when you apply the principles correctly. But sometimes there are challenges. As a sales professional, you may feel as if you're using your sales skills effectively, and that your calls are going really well. But somehow getting to that commitment isn't happening as consistently as you would like. You don't want to be pushy (which isn't effective), but you do want to gain commitments from customers.</p><p> Developing the sales skills that gain commitments involves learning to recognize buying signs and use certain &ldquo;convincer strategies&rdquo; to confirm the sale. Start with the mindset that \"closing\" isn't a singular event. In fact, with insightful sales solutions, closing takes place at every step of the sales process, whenever you take the opportunity to reinforce decisions and gain commitments. The final close is important, but it's not everything.</p><p> Here are some things to keep in mind when you face challenges in gaining customer commitments.</p><h3> Reassess: Have You Covered All the Bases?</h3><p> <br/> First, reassess whether you have covered all the processes that go into successful consultative selling:</p><li> <strong>  Pre-Call Planning </strong> - Before contacting a customer, consider expected outcomes and set your contact objectives. Prepare questions that guide the sale, and have a strategy for influencing customer questions. Be sure to research changes that are happening in your customer&rsquo;s business so you can position potential solutions that are relevant. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Call Openings </strong> - Are you building rapport, striving to understand the customer's communication style? Are you clear about why you're contacting them and the potential value that you bring? <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Discovering Needs </strong> - Do you have a sound understanding of the customer's business, their needs, and the value you can offer? They may not tell you their needs, and in fact may not entirely know what they are.  <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Positioning Solutions </strong> - Are you discussing solutions that add value for that particular customer? This is an ongoing process and involves doing some upfront research, spending time with them and asking smart questions. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Handling Stalls and Closing on Actions </strong> - When you make recommendations, you may encounter objections. The first step is to avoid defensiveness. So for instance, if someone were to object to your price, you could say something like, &ldquo;Price is important, Let&rsquo;s take a look at it.&rdquo; That will help get the customer moving with you rather than against. Then you can clarify to get to the heart of the issue by asking open-ended questions like, &ldquo;What are you comparing it to? Or How much too much is it?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Following Up </strong> - You may have to initiate actions that were promised during the sales process. Here you work to solidify action from the customer, and following through on what you said you would do can set you apart from the competition. Make sure you have a good internal communication system for keeping your pulse on implementation. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Fine-Tuning Strategy </strong> - Each customer contact is a chance to uncover information that can advance the sales strategy. Every new commitment is an opportunity to ask yourself what the next sales objective is for the account. <br/>  </li><h3> How Coaching Can Help</h3><p> Training expands your knowledge base, while coaching is more personal and deals with specific behaviors. Coaching is a matter of putting what you've learned into practice and receiving feedback and insights for moving forward. Since salespeople often operate independently, it is important for sales people to coach themselves after each call. Start with reinforcing what went well and then evaluate what you will change. If you get into this habit, it will become a natural part of your sales process. There is also benefit to receiving sales coaching from peers, sales managers and other experts. In Consultative Sales Certification, we hold online meetings where participants share successes and give each other feedback under the direction of an expert coach. Collectively, the group has all the answers to any sales situation you might face. If you are having difficulty moving a sale forward, pose the situation to your peers and managers. Most likely someone in the group will have faced the same issue at one point and may be able to help you walk through solutions. <br/>  </p><h3> Know that Closing Doesn't Just Happen</h3><p> Sometimes, the only thing that gets in the way of commitments is lack of taking action. &ldquo;This (participating in CSC) has helped me realize why we aren&rsquo;t closing. Before, we would go into a sale and feel like it felt good and then nothing would happen. So now we plan sales so we are able to plan for commitments and know when to ask for them,&rdquo; said Tari Warwick, Sales Operations Manager-Sashco and recent Consultative Sales Certification (CSC) graduate. If you are closing sales without taking action, then you should feel very blessed. Some of the most effective actions to take are simply getting small commitments throughout the entire process and interactions with your customers. Getting little yes&rsquo;s along the way makes the big yes easier. Recognizing and acting on simple buying signs is also very important to your ability to gain commitments. For instance, if a customer asks you to review details of your solution, that is a positive buying sign. They wouldn't bother if they weren't interested. Another positive buying sign is when customers lean forward. This is a sign of confidence and may be an opportunity to affirm decisions. <br/>  </p><h3> Reestablish and Demonstrate Value</h3><p> When you're working toward gaining a customer commitment, you may have to reestablish value. Remind the customer that they currently do not have the benefit your solution offers. If you've established rapport, your solution will be accepted more easily. Go back to your initial needs assessment. What potential solution do you offer to the customer to either alleviate a problem or to help them gain more. You may need to calculate out the exact gains. For instance, I just received a new insurance quote. While everything looked good, I did not have urgency to take action until the agent showed me exactly what I was going to be saving in a year. Then, be ready to follow with a simple closing question like, &ldquo;What is preventing you from moving forward right now?&rdquo; <br/>  </p><h3> Break It Down</h3><p> Sometimes when commitment to a sale appears far off, you have to wonder: is this account worth hanging in there for? If you conclude that it is, then you may consider breaking your value-oriented selling down into smaller, simpler steps. What small commitment could you expect from this potential customer, and how can you pursue that? From there you can add another small goal, working steadily toward the commitment for purchase. By accepting smaller wins, it also enables you to demonstrate how good you are. <br/>  </p><h3> Convincer Strategies</h3><p> The icing on the cake is really knowing how each and every person is influenced. Some people are influenced by testimonials from others, some from proof, some from the need for change and a myriad of other &ldquo;convincer strategies&rdquo;. While you can, and should, learn the formal convincer strategies aligned to consultative selling, it really is as simple as paying attention to the behavior of your customers. If they have asked you for a demonstration or proof in the past, chances are they will be influenced by the same for future considerations. Don&rsquo;t wait for them to ask you &ndash; armed with this information, take action and watch your closing rates increase! <br/>  </p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> Gaining commitment is at the heart of value-added selling, and sometimes gaining commitments can be challenging. But when your sales skills include reassessing and ensuring you've covered the bases, working with a coach on specific sales skills, establishing and demonstrating value for customers, and occasionally breaking the \"sale\" commitment down into smaller commitments, you can meet these challenges effectively.</p>",

    "content": "<p> With major regulatory changes, increasing demands from clients and changing communication with them, clients are looking for measurable value for the advice they receive. How do advisor's complete it in other parts of the world? The 5 most highly regulated countries from a financial advisor's perspective are Australia, United Kingdom, South Africa, United States and Canada. Let&rsquo;s look at seven key strategies based on research on what successful advisor's implement in providing value to their clients</p><li> <p>  <strong>   Time  </strong>   - Hours planned in working on their business. In a one year time frame &ndash; Project 100 - (you need 100 hours to implement change into your business such as updating your value proposition, going fee based or implementing new technologies. It is called project 100 because you will need to spend 2-3 hours per week for one year or 100 hours on building key practice management processes. The first step is to plan them in your calendar each week 2 hours working on your business. Plan the time first. For example every Wednesday from 8-10 or 11am working on the business implementing processes. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Business models  </strong>   -your goals , your clients and your business model . Does your business goals align with your clients? Managing a large financial advisory business is great if it matches your ideal client profile and creates a win-win relationship. When consulting with advisor's, they have stated they want to build their practice and manage 100-200 million of assets or more. Then they want to slow down and work less. A business model does not work that way. Find a person (coach, consultant, mentor) who can help you build the business model and ideal clientele you want to create. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Client feedback  </strong>   - what clients value , without this all else will be average. According to Business Health Pty Ltd. www.businesshealth.com.au , ( Business Health, Key Value Drivers US 2013) only 15% of advisors in the United States have a formal feedback processes for their clients.Those advisors that have a formal feedback system earn up to 52% more than advisor's who do not have a feedback system. A similar study had similar results by the USA FPA Research and Practice Institute study - Future of Practice Management -December 2013. If you want to become a &ldquo;ideal client focused advisor&rdquo; then build a formal feedback process into your client reviews. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Ideal client profile  </strong>   - creating a win-win on communication, compensation and expectations. What is your ideal future client profile. Have it detailed and do a case study and put it on your website for the world to see. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Ideal client service capacity  </strong>   &ndash;The 60 / 40 principle. More than 60% of your time should be spent seeing ideal clients- very few advisor's do that because they use the excuse of too much administration and lack of processes. A quick way to find your capacity for your clients is to add up the number of hours you work each year, say 1800 hours. Then find out what percent of time you service clients. Segment the clients into your main groups or segments. Then find out how much time you spend servicing each segment and add it up. The math may reveal some interesting capacity issues. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Document  </strong>  - Put your value proposition in writing and make it a process. Make a list of ALL your services and how you deliver value through those services. The critical part is the documented process that you use with clients to help them solve their problems. The document is not to showcase you, but the clearly outline how you uncover clients problems and how you solve them. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Ongoing services document   </strong>  - Build your client experience document . As a client what do I get for the fee I pay each year? Consider re-engage existing clients with an innovative and detailed review process and adding more value and services. Then build a document to show clients your detailed process for delivering your &ldquo;value added review service&rdquo;. </p></li><p> After all, it's all about your ideal clients. Don't waste any time. Put this on your to do list this week!</p><p> Copyright 2003-2015 By: Jay Conrad Levinson and Grant W.

    "title": "10 Ways To Stay Positive Despite Bad News",
    "link": "10-ways-to-stay-positive-despite-bad-news",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Many of you who are reading this article try to live a positive life and surround yourself with positive people and think positive thoughts. But what happens when something apparently bad hits you&mdash;whether in your finances, your health, or your relationships? All that positivity can slip through your fingers very quickly.</p><p> Abandoning a positive attitude can be exactly what will lock in the hardship. So how can one stay positive through tough times?</p><h3> 1. Live in the Moment</h3><p> <br/> Oh, how clich&eacute;. That&rsquo;s what everyone says. But guess what? When you eliminate obsessing over the past and feeling regret, it takes a big burden from your shoulders. And when you resist trying to predict the future, the anxiety of the unknown fades away. In this moment you are fully alive. It is important to march moment by moment, taking slow deliberate steps and not think too much where they are leading. For if those steps are deliberate, confident, and bold chances are your current challenges will be only memories when the moments add up to the future.</p><h3> 2. Daily Magic</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s very natural to lose faith when things aren&rsquo;t going your way. &ldquo;Dr. Charles, I used to believe in God, but now I don&rsquo;t know about that. My life is not as blessed as others. If there was a God, he wouldn&rsquo;t let me be in the mess I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo; Whether your faith was in a supernatural power, a source energy, God, or your inner strength, when something goes wrong in your life it is the default reaction of our brain to doubt any previous beliefs. That is precisely when noticing the little coincidences that occur in your daily life&mdash;what I call Daily Magic, become so important to recognize. Look for them every day and write them down in a journal. You may be someone else&rsquo;s Daily Magic, so write that down also. Look for these and ask others to share theirs with you. This can help reaffirm something larger going on beyond our physical senses.</p><h3> 3. Keep the Small Window Open</h3><p> <br/> When we awaken each morning, there is a small window of time in which we forget that something is wrong. When that window closes, our brain quickly reminds us of the danger we are in. While that window is open, ask yourself, &ldquo;What am I going to do today, to celebrate life?&rdquo; With your eyes closed, visualize yourself smiling and happy. Keep the window open as long as you can. You can do this by completing the sentences of fearful thoughts. For example, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to lose your house,&rdquo; you may think. Keeping the window open will help calm you. And finishing the sentence like this can help do so, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to lose your house&hellip;yes I will lose my house, if I believe that there is nothing I can do. But since I am resourceful and strong, I will always find a way and a way will always find me.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Avoid Defining Yourself By Your Challenges</h3><p> <br/> Thinking of yourself as the jilted lover or divorcee, or the cancer patient, or a fool with his money will lock in a self-opinion that will have your brain pushing you in the direction to prove yourself right. These self-definitions can become concrete realities instead of temporary challenges from which you might even learn and come out better. However, when you dig your heals into a financial challenge, or diagnosis, or breakup, you cut off any chance at moving on and creating a better future.</p><h3> 5. Be Choosy With Whom You Share</h3><p> <br/> A cynical friend once said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t complain to anyone. They either couldn&rsquo;t care less or they&rsquo;re glad it&rsquo;s not them. Although a cynical outlook, if you understand the dynamic of our primitive nature controlled by our automatic brain ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Drain-Breakthrough-Change-ebook/dp/B003I851QO/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   see Brain Drain  </a> </u> ), you will understand that your vulnerability can sometimes be the best thing to happen (unconsciously) to someone else. As  the saying goes, 'Misery loves company'. Not that they will act on it or do something to harm you, but many people will end up making comments or giving advice that is more about their insecurity than yours. There will be some who will genuinely care and even be able to help, but you must be choosy to know who they are.</p><h3> 6. Live Healthy</h3><p> <br/> When faced with a challenge, the stress can cause you to say, &ldquo;Screw it!&rdquo; And this often leads to unhealthy and sometimes self-destructive behaviors. Despite the challenge, it&rsquo;s crucial to eat well, continue exercising, and avoiding potentially harmful substances. Focusing on staying strong can foster confidence and open your mind up to potential solutions.</p><h3> 7. Daily Affirmations</h3><p> <br/> Declare each day that, &ldquo;While I am still alive, I plan to live the best life I can.&rdquo; Or, as I wrote above, &ldquo;I will always find a way and a way will always find me.&rdquo; Make up your own affirmations or look to social media for them. &ldquo;Like&rdquo; only positive pages on Facebook or other social media outlets.</p><h3> 8. Meditate or Pray Every Day</h3><p> <br/> Connect with your inner guidance. It is my belief that our mind is the gateway to our pure potential, our personal power, our divine nature, what I believe to be God. You may or may not believe in God, or you may have a very strict definition of who or what your God is. It matters not. An acceptance that there are realities and truths outside what our brains can comprehend and what our five senses can appreciate is enough to open the possibility of the inexplicable. With this possibility comes eternal hope.  As my favorite quote goes, &ldquo;When we pray we speak to God. When we meditate, God speaks to us.&rdquo; Start speaking to and listening to that inner guidance. You will begin to find a way out.</p><h3> 9. Smile, Laugh, &amp; Breathe</h3><p> <br/> No matter how down in the dumps you are, hold yourself high and make yourself smile and laugh as much as possible. When we are stressed our automatic brain causes us to fight or flee, which causes our breathing to become shallower. Making sure you control your breathing&mdash;slow breaths in for a count of four to six, hold for a count of two, and let out for a count of four to six&mdash;will trigger a relaxation response and cool the stress reaction. Make sure to check your face, often. When you are driving in the care, look at your face in the rearview mirror and if your mouth is down, smile it up!</p><h3> 10. Avoid the News and Talk Radio</h3><p> <br/> People are attracted to drama and that is exactly what the News and Talk Radio aims to deliver. But such drama can help you dig into your hopelessness.</p>",

    "title": "Dealing with Client Unresponsiveness",
    "link": "dealing-with-client-unresponsiveness",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Do these laments sound familiar?</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I had three or four good discussions with a prospective client about doing some work with his company, and now he doesn&rsquo;t return my phone calls or emails.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;They have our proposal but I haven&rsquo;t heard a thing back from them. I&rsquo;ve called and left several messages but gotten no response.&rdquo;</p><p> Advisors and other service providers are rarely satisfied with the level of responsiveness from the executives they are trying to sell to. But in the last few years the unresponsiveness seems to have grown into an epidemic. I&rsquo;ve been a consultant for 32 years, and it&rsquo;s the worst I&rsquo;ve seen.</p><p> Why is this happening? And how should you react?</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s why clients will always be less responsive than you would like, and why it&rsquo;s worse now:</h3><p> <br/> 1.  <strong>  There is relational asymmetry. </strong>  There is invariably an asymmetry between the importance of your engagement to you and its importance to your client. The sale or project in question may represent 20, 30, or even 50 percent of your time and attention. But for your client it might only account for five percent their daily life. It&rsquo;s like when you haven&rsquo;t eaten all day and are starving, and you&rsquo;re waiting in a restaurant to be served. You can&rsquo;t think about anything but that cheeseburger that you ordered, but for the restaurant it&rsquo;s just one meal out of hundreds.  What is urgent and important to you is probably important but not urgent for your client!</p><p> 2.  <strong>  Clients are preoccupied with urgent, short-term issues. </strong>  Your client probably works in a large organization, and they are subject to all the short-term craziness that big corporations can impose on individual executives. I once had a prospective client who didn&rsquo;t get back to me on a major proposal for weeks because she had to attend seven holiday parties in ten days at different locations all over the country!</p><p> 3.  <strong>  There is more uncertainty. </strong>  The economic turmoil of the last five years has changed many of the dynamics of the corporate buying process. A variety of things are slowing down client&rsquo;s ability to respond: Approvals must be made at a higher level; corporate budgets are more changeable and may get cut or augmented on short notice; procurement is now involved more frequently; and executives are feeling less secure about their ability to make decisions and stick to them, concerned that they will be second guessed.  </p><h3> How should you respond and react?</h3><p> <br/> 1.  <strong>  Do a better job of walking in your client&rsquo;s shoes. </strong>  Talk to them about the pressures and constraints they are under. Spend time at their office or in their operations. You&rsquo;ll be more empathetic, you&rsquo;ll have a better understanding of why they are perhaps not being as responsive as you&rsquo;d like, and you may just learn some things that will help you add more value in the relationship.</p><p> 2.  <strong>  Be proactive but don&rsquo;t stalk them. </strong>  Always try to get a commitment to a next step&mdash;for example, if you submit a proposal, make an appointment to discuss it when you give it to your client. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to say to a client, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve addressed this problem successfully for a number of other clients. Would it be helpful if I put together an outline of an approach that I think would work for you?&rdquo; After two or three attempts to connect with your client, consider a time out. Don&rsquo;t email them six times in a row if they aren&rsquo;t responding. Instead, send a short, handwritten note saying you&rsquo;d be delighted to pick up the issue with them if and when if it becomes a priority again in the future.</p><p> 3.  <strong>  Be helpful.  </strong> Don&rsquo;t make the sole focus of your interactions a series of attempts to get them take the next step to conclude a sale with you! Be helpful and add value. Send them an article or book that might help them better understand their issue. Suggest an introduction to a past client who has confronted the same challenge. Send them a note saying, &ldquo;I've been thinking about your situation, and here are the three key questions I would be asking myself if I were in your shoes,&rdquo; and so on.</p><p> 4.  <strong>  Remember that it&rsquo;s all about them not you.  </strong> Most of the reasons behind your client&rsquo;s unresponsiveness have to do with issues they are grappling with, not with you. Just because they are not calling you back doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t like you and don&rsquo;t respect your work. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t interested in collaborating with you. It usually just means some other priority has reared its head and they are not focused on you and your proposal right now.</p><h3> Do everything you can to add value and be responsive on your end.</h3><p> <br/> Then, sit tight&mdash;the issue may become important again to your client and suddenly they will be more responsive. Or, it may not. And we all know the best antidote to that scenario is to have a variety of leads that you&rsquo;re working on. When all your eggs are in one basket, and that basket gets put in cold storage, it&rsquo;s not a good feeling. So, convert that angst and worry into redoubling your outreach efforts to current clients, past clients, and other executives in your network.</p><p> What has your own experience been? What have you done to manage client unresponsiveness and indecisiveness?</p><p>  </p>",

His wife is also suing for the loss of intimacy with her husband.</p><p> My comments are not about the merits of the case but address why businesses do anything nice for customers when those actions can result in cases like the Starbucks spill. <br/>  </p><h3> For me the reason is simple!  </h3><p> <br/> Most customers appreciate kindnesses.  Yes, a customer could sue a hotel because the customer choked on the chocolate placed on their pillow but I say,  &ldquo;give them the chocolate.&rdquo;</p><p> If we treat every customer like they are out to cheat or harm us, we reduce our capacity to have maximum positive impact on the throngs of customers who would welcome the respect and kindness we extend.</p><p> Whether you are a business owner who treats employees like incipient thieves or a leader who encourages your people to assume the worst in customers,  I suspect you will attract the outcomes you predict.</p><p> I have found it both more gratifying and more productive to assume the best in people and manage those rare exceptions where people let me down than to assume the worst.</p><p> For now, I am headed to Starbucks to buy a cup of coffee in support of the way the company has delighted me through the years&hellip;</p>",

    "title": "Planning to Overcome the Risks to Women's Retirement",
    "link": "planning-to-overcome-the-risks-to-womens-retirement",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a financial adviser with an 80 year old mother who I helped deal with her 90 year old sister&rsquo;s affairs, I&rsquo;m acutely aware of the women&rsquo;s retirement crisis. I was listening to Sallie Krawcheck on Morning Joe, April 27 who highlighted that the face of nursing homes was decidedly female. I saw this first hand when my aunt moved from her home to a nursing home when the care from my cousin was no longer good enough. My aunt and my mother were from the generation that benefited from Social Security and pensions. As you know, things have changed. Let&rsquo;s look at the issues that many women face today.</p><h3> Women&rsquo;s retirement and the downside of living a long healthy life</h3><p> <br/> For quite some time women have lived longer than men of the same age. Social security offers a benefit that assumed a heterosexual marriage. Many women such as my mother married men were older than themselves. My mom was 7 years younger than my dad. My mother has already lived 10 years past when my dad died. If the projections hold, she will live 17 years without the additional financial resources that my dad brought to her house from pension and Social Security. My aunt lived 29 years after her husband died! She had no children to help care for her.</p><p> Few people I know actually work with someone who is calculating what their potential healthcare and long term care expenses will be in the future. My mom was blessed to have great healthcare. I know that is not the case with many seniors that balance paying for medications against living expenses. Regarding long term care, I know from my aunt and mother they would much rather live at home than be in either assisted-living or in a nursing home. As an only child with grade school age children, I am not an option for providing in-home care for my mom.</p><h3> Single women&rsquo;s retirement and the downside of living a long healthy life</h3><p> <br/> There are many women who remain single their entire lives. My wife&rsquo;s aunt is one example. She does not have the additional income that would come from having a husband that worked outside the home. This further multiplies the economic impact of the 78% of what a man earns wage gap that many women face. Single women do not receive any survivor benefits from pensions, etc. They&rsquo;re all on their own. Terry Savage, speaking at Money Smart week in Chicago highlighted that potentially the most challenged women in retirement are those who are 60+ without a spouse, life partner or children. Who will care for them when their time comes? There is a huge need for during your life estate planning, healthcare powers of attorney for healthcare and property, as well as directives and letters of instruction, etc.</p><h3> When taking care of others impact women&rsquo;s retirement</h3><p> <br/> Often women find themselves in and out of the workforce to either have children take care of aging parents. This easily affects the calculation of their individual Social Security benefit. Many women get divorced. If you are married for less than 10 years you won&rsquo;t get your husbands Social Security. If you do remarry, you will forfeit the Social Security benefits from your first husband and potentially not get any of your next husband. These factors make planning for a woman&rsquo;s retirement that much more challenging. Popular calculators don&rsquo;t effectively address women&rsquo;s retirement issues. These tools use straight-line calculations such as income and rate of inflation.</p><h3> Women&rsquo;s retirement planning is different</h3><p> <br/> I believe that many of these issues can be addressed. The first starts with assessing what you want based on your resources. I agree that women and men should make the same amount of money for the same job. However, men aren&rsquo;t necessarily saving enough to maintain their lifestyle in retirement. It&rsquo;s popular for planning specialists such as CFPs to target an 80% replacement rate of your last year&rsquo;s salary. Let&rsquo;s say you make $100,000, would you feel comfortable living on $80,000? This assumes that certain expenses you currently have you won&rsquo;t have in retirement, like a mortgage or reduced ones like dry cleaning. You may be like some clients that I have that replaced some of those expenses with new expenses, like travel and actually needed more than 80%.</p><p> I find that most people benefit from some level of custom planning. Many peoples biggest challenge is sticking to their plan. While many people hold their investment advisor accountable for achieving investment return targets, they don&rsquo;t hold themselves accountable for hitting their savings goals. You may find it beneficial to get several of your friends with similar situations to work with a common adviser where you can benefit from the behavioral support of one another. The road may be rocky at some point so it&rsquo;s great when others can have some shared level of experience.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve seen how some friends have become strained because one friend ended up being in a better position for one reason or another. I believe you should find a financial adviser that is sensitive to women&rsquo;s retirement issues.</p><p> I am biased towards the planning of a CHARTERED RETIREMENT PLANNING COUNSELOR or a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER, considered by some to be the elite financial planning credential. Anyone can call themselves a financial planner. Everyone has not endured the coursework and continuing education standards of these credentials. You can verify a CFP credentials or search for one in your area at letsmakeaplan.org.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t delay planning. The cost of waiting includes higher rates of savings, needing to take on more market risk, retiring later or worse, compromising your retirement lifestyle.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crcavnet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mitch Avnet  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/C_R_Concepts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Compliance Risk Concepts  </u> </a></p><p> The world has changed in cyber space. It used to be a company could create a strong exterior wall with firewalls, intrusion detection, virtual private networks and a robust set of virus response tools to keep the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; out of the critical data you use to perform your business dealings.   That was Then and but this is Now.   </p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Now&rdquo; </strong>  is defined by a much more complex world in which the statistics point to the majority businesses having already been hacked in some way. And in the B2B environment we live in, up and down stream partners are also a part of a company&rsquo;s over all risk. And a risk to one may very well be a risk inherited by all within a supply chain or electronic interface community. Whether you have already felt the pain and loss of a hacking incident or fear you are still waiting for the proverbial &ldquo;shoe to drop&rdquo;, how you respond to and recover from a cyber incident will dictate how much you lose both in direct impacts and public confidence.   </p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Now&rdquo; </strong>  means shifting our mindset from just building and defending the IT infrastructure and applications to also preparing for how to respond to when a cyber incident occurs.</p><p> The most important factor to consider in preparing to respond to a cyber incident is time. The speed which makes world-wide B2B electronic transactions so much of a business advantage also creates an enormous amount of risk for the company. During a cyber incident a company needs to not have to think, they just need to do and do quickly. The second factor to consider is that in the 21st Century every business is an information technology business. Responding to a cyber incident is a team sport which requires involvement from information technology, operations, strategic communications, human resources, security, risk, vendor management, general counsel, finance, sales and leadership.</p><p> So you have a lot of people, with their own important missions, needing to be aligned together to move out quickly and seamlessly, many times across countries and continents, without having to think during a cyber incident.  <strong>  What could go wrong you ask? </strong>  Basically everything, if you are not prepared to respond.</p><p> We believe there is much for commercial industry to learn from the US military model for handling incidents and crises. Our Service members use mission minded military concepts everyday to respond to natural disasters and keep our enemies at bay. They do it better than anyone else.   We are so impressed with this military model we have created a consulting product to help companies like yours develop and implement a high speed cyber response capability.   We will come along side your staff with prior military and Department of Defense employees to build military discipline and rigor into a response capability which will posture your organization with plans and associated products like exercises and assessments to be ready to respond quickly and effectively.</p>",

    "link": "making-the-most-of-client-feedback",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;We have some preliminary designs for our updated website&rdquo; a client said to me recently. &ldquo;Would you take a look?&rdquo; </strong> The services and attributes they featured most prominently on the homepage sounded good (they also sounded like most other advisors). They felt strongly about what their company stood for and what they did for clients and worked with marketing experts from the company designing their website to make sure they were presented well. However, several things clients had indicated were most valuable to them in a client advisory board meeting the prior year were missing. And several attributes they featured prominently had not been mentioned by clients when we asked what was important to them. &ldquo;It looks nice&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Last year, your clients had mentioned these other three things as being important. <strong>  Would it be worth working them in someplace?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. We didn&rsquo;t look at that list before we talked with the web company.&rdquo;</p><h3> This kind of thing happens more frequently than I would like to admit.</h3><p> <br/> A trap that advisors can fall into is asking for and receiving feedback, addressing the issue at hand, then setting aside and maybe forgetting the feedback when they move on to future projects.</p><p> Asking your clients what they value most about what you do and finding out from them what they believe makes you different from other advisors can be the key to differentiating your firm from other advisory firms. Customizing your service mix and your marketing in response to that feedback is what makes you client driven and can be a powerful tool in helping you attractreferrals and new clients. And more important than soliciting that feedback is what you do with it. If you respond to it and make a few changes but don&rsquo;t look for opportunities to apply it other ways in your practice you are missing a big opportunity. Worse, if you ask for the feedback and then fail to act on it, it is worse than never having asked at all.</p><p> Whether it be through surveys, personal interviews, or your client advisory board, clients are taking some level of risk in providing you honest, candid feedback. Any time they offer a suggestion for change, they are vulnerable. They are willing to share with you something that potentially may not be what you want to hear because they care about you and want you to succeed. Honoring the feedback drives loyalty. Failure to acknowledge it or act on it diminishes the relationship and will help guarantee you get less of it in the future. That&rsquo;s one reason why I insist that whenever one of my clients convenes their client advisory board they report back to the board on each of the issues that were covered in the prior meeting. Even if there is no progress yet, I feel it important to let people know it is still on the radar. A board member and one meeting I facilitated made the comment &ldquo;we talk about a lot of things in these meetings, but I&rsquo;m not sure what you ever did with a lot of those suggestions.&rdquo; It was the kind of comment you never want to hear from one of your best clients.</p><h3> Here are a few things you can do to help keep your clients advice handy and on top of your mind.</h3><p> <br/> 1. <strong>  Announce the feedback to your clients. </strong>  When you get feedback, whether it be through surveys, interviews, or your board, write about what you heard in your client newsletter or posted on your website. Acknowledge that the feedback was received. Confirm to clients who provided you feedback that some of their peers had similar opinions. And let any clients who were not involved in providing it hear about it. Let everyone know you are receptive to the guidance.</p><p> <strong>  2. Make specific plans to change or improve something based on the feedback.  </strong> Go beyond the thought &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s interesting&rdquo; and figure out how you will make some of those ideas operational. How can you incorporate the guidance into your messaging or client experience? How can you take the feedback and make something real out of it?</p><p> <strong>  3. Connect the feedback to the change </strong> when you implement an improvement. Instead of announcing how excited you are about putting up the fancy new website or an improved layout to your investment reports, communicate &ldquo;you spoke and we listened.&rdquo; Reiterate that clients let you know that something was important to them and that in response you moved a message to your new homepage or made that graph of cumulative deposits and balance bigger and more prominent.</p><p> <strong>  4. Keep a central file of the feedback you receive.  </strong> Review it whenever you make changes to your marketing or your service mix. Consulted for inspiration when you are drafting client communications.</p><p> <strong>  5. Consult a record of your client feedback when redrafting or updating your strategic plan. </strong> Bring the voice of the client into your business planning process. That&rsquo;s the basis of being client driven. Incorporate your clients opinions about where they would like the business to go. It is a great way to make sure that your services are consistently more valuable and more relevant to your clients. And it will help drive client loyalty and referrals.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MWMcLaughlin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael McLaughlin  </a> </u> | MindShare Consulting </p><h3> Think Again.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re like a lot of consultants, your plate is full. Very full.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve got projects to run, a business to manage, and a personal life. Sometimes, there&rsquo;s just not enough time in the day.</p><p> The natural reaction to the stress of being overloaded is to put off something on your to-do list. When you get too busy, you sort through your priorities and often it&rsquo;s your marketing activities that you put on the back burner.</p><p> Why? Because it&rsquo;s an easy thing to put on hold. You can convince yourself that publishing that article later than planned won&rsquo;t hurt anything. Or you promise yourself that you will rework your web presence next month.</p><p> You can convince yourself that publishing that article later than planned won&rsquo;t hurt anything.</p><p> If the reason you feel forced to pull back on marketing is because you have too much client work to do, that&rsquo;s not a bad problem to have.</p><p> But the short-term gain from your client work, no matter how good it is, can put your business in a deep hole once that work slows up.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s a problem you  don&rsquo;t  want to have.</p><p> No doubt, you know it&rsquo;s a mistake to let your marketing activities slip.</p><p> But to underscore the point, I&rsquo;m going to use the business writer&rsquo;s rule of social proof. When in doubt, roll out Peter Drucker.</p><p> Drucker summed up his take on marketing this way:</p><p> &ldquo;Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two&mdash;and only two&mdash;basic functions: marketing and innovation.&rdquo;</p><p> Even though you understand the long-term implications of setting aside your marketing program, you may feel that&rsquo;s your only option. So you resolve to put your head down, get the client work done, and ramp up your marketing as soon as things settle down.</p><p> Even though you understand the long-term implications of setting aside your marketing program, you may feel that&rsquo;s your only option.</p><p> Fortunately, you do have another choice.</p><p> Think about the options you have for marketing your business. You have the big, long-term, strategic marketing initiatives&mdash;adding a new service line, overhauling your web site, or launching a new blog, for example.</p><p> Then you have the less complex, less time-consuming marketing tactics, like asking clients for testimonials, planning a referral strategy, or making contact with your existing and former clients to see how they&rsquo;re doing.</p><p> If something has to give in your marketing plan because of your other commitments, it&rsquo;s best to postpone (but not abandon) the huge projects, that is, those that take the most of your time, energy, and attention.</p><p> But you shouldn&rsquo;t give up on marketing entirely. Instead, you want to shift your focus from the long-term initiatives to the short-term ones.</p><p> So, what should you do?</p><h3> The One-Hour Marketing Plan</h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;re swamped with other priorities, think small.</p><p> You can find lots of marketing tactics that will make an impact, don&rsquo;t take much time, and don&rsquo;t cost much.</p><p> Even the busiest person can find an hour a week to keep the marketing flame alive.</p><p> Think about tackling one small marketing activity every week. Commit to one hour of marketing, no matter how busy you are. Even the busiest person can find an hour a week to keep the marketing flame alive.</p><p> If you can do one thing every week, the results will add up quickly. Plus, you&rsquo;ll get rid of that uneasy feeling that you&rsquo;re not doing what you really should be.</p><p> To get rolling with your one-hour marketing plan, begin with a question: What short-term marketing activities could you do right away that would only take an hour or so a week?</p><p> You don&rsquo;t want to do just anything. It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense, for instance, to start writing a book and plan to get it done in an hour a week.</p><p> The idea is to take actions that keep you (and your ideas) in front of existing or former clients. Why? Because the marketing effort for these activities is low but the benefit can be high.</p><p> The idea is to take actions that keep you (and your ideas) in front of existing or former clients.</p><p> For example, you could commit to making one call a week to a previous client to ask for a testimonial. If you did that for four weeks, you&rsquo;d have four new testimonials, you&rsquo;d have caught up with four former clients, and you&rsquo;d be maintaining your marketing momentum.</p><p> If asking for testimonials isn&rsquo;t your thing, you could check in with one former client per week to rekindle the relationship. Naturally, you&rsquo;ve got to have something interesting to say before you make contact. But you shouldn&rsquo;t need more than an hour to find something of value to serve as a conversation starter.</p><p> You have many low-cost, simple marketing options. You can take a former or existing client to lunch,  do some limited industry research and share it with your network, or prepare a plan for asking past clients for referrals.</p><p> Everyone can come up with a few small marketing ideas. In fact, your first one could be to make an eight-week plan for the one-hour things you&rsquo;ll do over the next two months.</p><p> Remember, I&rsquo;m talking about what to do when you feel that you have no choice but to temporarily put the brakes on marketing. This is a suboptimal, interim solution, not a long-term approach to marketing.</p><p> This is a suboptimal, interim solution, not a long-term approach to marketing.</p><p> If you ignore the long-term, your growth prospects dim. So focus on these short-term activities for a couple of months at the most. Then, you have to restart your main marketing initiatives.</p><p> Though it seems less than ideal, taking small steps will maintain your marketing momentum, make it easier to get your marketing program back on track once you have more time, and you won&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re ignoring what Peter Drucker said is the most important part of any business.</p><p> What&rsquo;s on your one-hour marketing list?</p>",

Their team approach was somewhat overwhelming, adding too many personalities to the mix and parading their token female Advisor (even though she was about to go out on maternity leave) as if that was the only way to make a connection.</p><p> <strong>  The second was a smaller team who tried to connect with her, but spoke way over her head. </strong>  She came away from the meeting more confused and anxious about her ability to grasp the financial world.</p><p> While both Advisors seemed capable and had the tools and qualifications that seemed important, something just wasn't right.</p><p> <strong>  Then she walked into the third office, the receptionist was lovely, so warm and friendly; the lobby was beautifully decorated with fresh flowers and reading material geared for women. </strong>   She was quickly greeted by members of the team and escorted into a smaller conference room. There was food and coffee, making her feel warm comfortable, wanted and important. <strong>   The connection was immediate, and by the end of the meeting, together, they had called her current firm and unraveled the investments causing her concern. </strong></p><h3> So what was it that made the difference?</h3><p> <br/> Was the third party more qualified? Did they have more licenses? Since none of the Advisors had the opportunity to provide a financial plan, their tools and recommendations were not in question. Perhaps it all started with those first impressions, a warm greeting, a cozy environment, feeling special and appreciated from the moment she walked in the door.  <strong>  They made her feel that she was important and it wasn't just about her money. </strong></p><p> It's the little things that count especially for women. They need to feel comfortable, respected and appreciated. Your tools, experience, and credentials are a commodity that can often be found elsewhere; <strong>   it&rsquo;s the environment, connection, and relationship you create with women that can have the greatest impact on your ability to gain her commitment to do business with you. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Could it be that Greece's Great Unraveling is finally at hand? I know, I know. We've heard so many \"sky is falling\" stories about Greece in the past several years, one is justifiably tempted to pay the matter no heed. If Greece were going to default, wouldn't they have done it by now? <br/> <br/> But it would be a mistake to think there will never come a day of reckoning. And that day does seem to be approaching fast. Could it happen this week? <br/> <br/> Might  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/bond-market-sell-off-signals-mounting-financial-crisis/5448179\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the European bond rout  </a> </u>  be a key \"tell\" for what's about to happen in Greece? </p><p> You might recall, it wasn't that far back (not even two weeks ago) that Bill Gross (Janus Capital) raised eyebrows with his now-famous/then-cocky-sounding declaration that German bonds represented  <u>  <a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/articles/german-bunds-the-short-of-the-century-1430539083\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   \"the short of the century.\"  </a> </u> <br/> <br/> I expect Mr. Gross is doing quite well these days.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/european-bonds-back-to-pre-qe-levels-after-weeklong-selloff-1431010733\" target=\"_blank\">   German bonds have fallen dramatically  </a> </u>  (yields have skyrocketed) since he made that cocky-sounding pronouncement. As one person (Franck Dixmier, chief investment officer for European fixed income at Allianz Global Investors) put it, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as though QE disappeared&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; (QE being Quantitative Easing, the massive bond buyback project of the European Central Bank, designed to boost inflation and spending by flooding the market with cheap Euros.) <br/> <br/> Gold has also been trending higher over the past week. In fact, gold rose nearly half a percent on Friday, at the same time that the U.S. stock market rallied sharply. Usually, gold and the Dow Jones Industrial Average travel in opposite directions. <br/> <br/> In a recent Forbes.com article, Raoul Ruparel asks  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/05/07/what-has-caused-europes-bond-rout/\" target=\"_blank\">   What Has Caused Europe's Bond Rout?  </a> </u>  He lists several possible answers but doesn't even mention the most obvious one: Greece will soon default. Among European countries, the two largest holders of Greek debt are France and Germany. The German 10-yr Bund has been among the hardest-hit bonds. <br/> <br/> The German Bund falling; gold rising. Could it be someone knows something? <br/> <br/> For a variety of technical reasons, IMF loans are arguably the most \"forgiving\" to default on, so some would say if and when Greece defaults, it will begin with an IMF obligation. There will be attempts to stem contagion, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that when Greece unwinds, you don't want to be holding anything but gold. (Much of the impact of a Greek default will be absorbed by Germany and France. It will send bond yields even higher, as those countries have to pay investors more to accept the risk of holding French or German debt.) U.S. stocks are safe over the long term but would certainly get whacked in the initial panic phase of the Great Unwind, since markets hate uncertainty. Gold (alone) represents certainty. <br/> <br/> It's getting late. Do you know where your money is parked?</p>",

These amazing panelists shared their wisdom and great personal stories on how to mentor sucessfully:</p><li> <u>  Shaya Fathali </u> , Sr. Manager, Technical Communications, Altera,</li><li> <u>  Tonie Hansen </u> , Senior Director, Corporate Responsibility, NVIDIA</li><li> <u>  Yasmeen Jafari </u> , HR Business Partner, Intuitive Surgical</li><li> <u>  Leila Pourhashemi </u> , Head of Product Operations, eBay Marketplaces</li><li> <u>  Ching Valdezco </u> , Director, Strategy and Planning, HP Enterprise Services</li><li> <u>  Shobhana Viswanathan </u> , Director of Product Marketing, Neustar, Inc. <br/>  </li><p> Leveraging your mentorship to build your career, and your life is essential to success.</p><h3> Knowing how to do it effectively is the key.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Know what you want and why you want it and then decide with whom you should connect. </strong> Being specific about what you need to optimize work, behavior and communication etc., while keeping an eye on your overarching goal might help you with both your short-term and your long-term goals. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Know your blind-spots and areas of weakness/less preference </strong> and complement yourself with people who can help you fill the gaps. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Be authentic and genuine in your communications. </strong> Focus on building relationships based on trust to a wide variety of people.</p><p> <strong>  4. Accept all stretch goals within reason, </strong> and if you have a purpose for it. It will help you see yourself and your world in a different way.</p><p> <strong>  5. In the same token, embrace diversity </strong> &ndash; people and things around you who are not-like-you. It may feel uncomfortable at first, but it can have the up-side of being another kind of stretch goal for yourself. Example: Every company has a different DNA, so if you move companies, embrace the opportunity to meet peers and others who can help you get integrated with the-way-things are done.</p><p> Millennials have so much to teach us in their team orientation, in their perspective about the leaders-in-charge, in their sometimes forward, unapologetic approach to solving problems. There are learnings there, especially if their mindset makes you feel uncomfortable.</p><h3> 6. Be ever open, ever persistent, ever out-wardly focused, ever focused on paying it forward. </h3><p> Take the perspective that you can learn something from everyone. <br/> <br/> <br/> <strong>  7. Be ever influencing who is in your sphere </strong> and how you are influencing others in your sphere, while expanding your reach selectively. <br/> <br/> <strong>  8. Find and speak your voice </strong> , for the purpose of growing and sharing your knowledge, wisdom, brand and network.</p><p> <strong>  9. Look for different kinds of mentors, </strong> sponsors, coaches and allies, and leverage them for different reasons, while always keeping an eye out on &lsquo;what&rsquo;s in it for them&rsquo;. <br/> <br/> <strong>  10. Always look for and create win-win experiences for all. </strong> This is much more important than whether it&rsquo;s a structured or unstructured mentoring relationship.</p><p> Change is hard, and inevitable. Having the right people with you and for you;  those who help you embrace who you are *and* who you&rsquo;d like to become; supports the journey for all. In the end, YOU are the one who owns your career path and your success. Shape your experiences, plans and outcomes and take responsibility for it.</p><p> <strong>  Remember: Above all, mentorship and sponsorship are about relationships. </strong> Build your relationships not your network, and your career will be rich with opportunity.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Making the right document management technology decision for your business requires a sound assessment of the ROI. Below are five positive changes derived from adopting digital document management, plus a handy guide to calculating the figures for your firm.</p><h3> 1. Freedom from pricey paper</h3><p> <br/> This is a great starting point for ROI calculation as the results can be quite accurate. Paper-related costs can be tallied by analyzing the following expenses:</p><li> Rent for offsite document storage</li><li> Filing supplies, such as cabinets and folders</li><li> Shipping of documents to clients, offsite departments, etc.</li><li> Ink, toner and other printing costs</li><li> The cost of paper itself</li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the_office_0.png\" width=\"645\"/></p><p> Woo! We&rsquo;re about to be irrelevant!</p><h3> 2. Time is on your side</h3><p> <br/> A 2012 IDC report found that information workers spent up to 20% of their time filing and searching through paper documents. On top of that, they wasted over 10 hours a week searching for, but not finding, documents, recreating lost documents and other time-consuming tasks. These figures can be attributed to the problems inherent in hardcopy document management.</p><p> By implementing document management in a digital format, companies can allot more time to using information and less time to finding it. Instead of wondering who has a report or combing through archives for hours, employees can instantly retrieve documents within a digital repository through a simple search.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hiding_sheep.png\" width=\"646\"/></p><p> Finding a document is about as easy as finding the animal in this photo.</p><h3> 3. Data safe, bottom line happy</h3><p> <br/> If you think losing one file is frustrating, imagine losing thousands of them in a flood, fire or other disaster. Rather than cutting back on current unnecessary expenses, a disaster recovery plan is all about avoiding future ones. Ask yourself if maintaining rooms full of paper documents is worth millions of dollars in restoration costs.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/splash.png\" width=\"646\"/></p><p> Digital: The difference between a pro surfer and this person.</p><h3> 4. Bye-bye busy work</h3><p> <br/> What can you do with all the time saved through digital document management? More work, obviously! By spending less time on processing contracts, invoices and customer inquiries, companies increase their work capacity and potential for growth.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/assembly_line.png\" width=\"646\"/></p><p> First, make sure your team can handle faster workflow.</p><h3> 5.  Space, not waste</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve just gone over what to do with extra time, but what about all that extra space? Look around your office and imagine what it could look like without all the file cabinets and storage rooms. All of that space could be used more productively. Just remember, a productive environment isn&rsquo;t solely about rows and rows of workstations.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ball_pit.png\" width=\"645\"/></p><p> You could make a ball pit with the crumpled-up documents you no longer use.</p><h3> ROI Resources</h3><p> <br/> You don&rsquo;t have to take the advice in this post at face value. Calculate your own ROI and decide if document management software is the right choice by using this helpful calculation guide:  <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/solutionexchange/create-your-own-cost-benefit-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Create Your Own Cost-Benefit Analysis  </u> </a></p><p> The above resources are for preliminary purposes.

    "content": "<p> Insufficient pension funding and opaque accounting rules creates angst for public pension recipients, budgetary stress for states and uncertainty for public debt investors. While there are other options, pension bonds address two central deficiencies in the management of state pension system: highly variable and inconsistent funding and the lack of transparent accounting.</p><h3> Here in the State of Washington, Governor Inslee&rsquo;s proposed fiscal year 2015-17 budget allocates $210.0 million for K-12 pension funding.</h3><p> <br/> If fiscal year 2014 is any indication, the new biennium&rsquo;s budgeted contribution for the Teachers and School Employees Retirement Systems will fall short of the required pension payment contribution. The Public Employees Retirement System was also underfunded in fiscal year 2014 receiving only 68.5% of the annual payment required. Recent underfunding by the State has resulted in these pension plans having only 83.9% of the assets needed to pay future pension benefits. The underfunding of the State&rsquo;s pension plans should concern public employees because it jeopardizes their future pension payments. State lawmakers should also be concerned because underfunding can quickly erode aggregate pension funding ratios and creates greater budget uncertainty. Eventually, variable and inconsistent pension funding can lead to significant budgetary stress. Just look to Illinois and New Jersey as current examples. Each of these states neglected their required annual pension payments and now must reduce benefits, curtail public services and/or raise taxes in an attempt to catch up. Pension obligation bonds limit the uncertainty of pension funding due to their transparent and stable payment timeline.</p><h3> Financial transparency is integral to fixing pension liability mismanagement.</h3><p> <br/> Estimates of future pension costs are almost always much larger than current pension liabilities. As such, current governmental accounting standards mask future pension costs because the total pension liability disclosure is not required. Issuance of pension bonds comes with clear accounting and would be preferable to the current system. Better financial disclosure applied to pension bonds is a win for both bondholders and pensioners because it improves their chances of receiving future payments and forces politicians to be more honest about the State&rsquo;s source of pension funding. Specifically, pension bonds provide funding for the investments that are needed to fully satisfy current and future pension entitlements. Moreover, pension bonds do not increase total debt outstanding but convert existing off balance sheet liabilities from a footnote in a State&rsquo;s financial statement to a line item on the balance sheet and income statement that fully reflects the true cost of the obligation. This transparency can reduce budgetary pressure, which could otherwise weaken the financial health and negatively impact funding for K-12 schools, roads and bridges and public universities.</p><p> Public employees who are promised a pension and holders of public debt who are promised a full return of money loaned should be asking the same question: <strong>  What is the likelihood of receiving future payments in full, and just as promised?  </strong> Public pension recipients and bond investors should work together in demanding an end to nondisclosure and highly variable and inconsistent funding of pension plans, which pose a risk to our shared future. Ultimately, the public will benefit from stable service delivery, improved financial health of states and greater public involvement through more transparency. </p>",

But it&rsquo;s nothing yet.</p><p> I realised this as I stood forlornly at Heathrow security this morning (my usual hangout area) and watched as the security guards forensically analysed the bags of many weary passengers.  My first thought was how archaic a system we live in that cannot work out you&rsquo;re not a terrorist.  A system that requires every passenger to strip all metal items into bins, and take out their laptops and drinking water to ensure it won&rsquo;t explode.</p><p> My second thought was even clearer, as the security guard came to search my bag and dragged out charger after charger, for my many battery operated gadgets.  Then there were the USB Cables (about 10) to support the charging of the gadgets from the chargers.  Then there were the electricity cables for the laptops I carry (one big and one small).  As I looked at all these wires and cables, I&rsquo;m thinking: why are we still so reliant on such old technologies.</p><h3> I want to live in a world where technology is self-charging via solar panels through the air. </h3><p> <br/> A world where you never see this &hellip;</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-8.58.44-AM.png\" width=\"382\"/></p><p> or this &hellip;</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-8.59.24-AM.png\" width=\"608\"/></p><p> or this &hellip;</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-9.03.36-AM.png\" width=\"528\"/></p><h3> In fact, it fascinates me to think of where all this is going. </h3><p> <br/> In a talk last year, Larry Page of Google touched on this and said that we ain&rsquo;t seen nuthin&rsquo; yet. (See video above)</p><p> His example was the Google deep learning project that had so far educated a computer to recognise a cat just from analysing YouTube videos.  Larry talks about how Google's Deep Mind project &ldquo;ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats, just by itself. Now, that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here.

Generally speaking, you can&rsquo;t control the timing of a sale but you can control the extent to which your pipeline is aware of your products and services. When a need develops and your leads, prospects, and clients are aware that your services can help them, you have an opportunity to make a sale. This is why managing your sales funnel is so important.</p><li> <strong>  Marketing Tip </strong> : Create a sales funnel. Segment each person in your funnel based on their needs, profession, and interests. Your sales funnel should have three goals; funnel more leads into your pipeline, increase the percentage of people who move through each level, and know exactly what steps to execute during each stage to nurture relationships. A simple sales funnel formula starts with leads at the top, followed by prospects, and ultimately clients. <br/>  </li><h3> Tailor Events to Small Groups</h3><p> Effective event planning relies on your ability to address pressing pain points in your target audiences&rsquo; lives and create strategies to reach and influence them. Events, like marketing messages, must be carefully crafted for a select group of people to garner their attention. If your topic doesn&rsquo;t resonate with them, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely they will attend.</p><li> <strong>  Marketing Tip </strong> : Limit your guest list. Client events should not be a &ldquo;one-size-fits-all.&rdquo; Trying to please all of your clients, who have a wide range of different needs, is rarely effective. The better approach is to hold more events that are smaller in nature and appeal to a specific group of people. <br/>  </li><h3> Establish Alliances</h3><p> Advisors who take the time to invest in building strategic alliances generate higher revenues and profits. Coordinating the right mix of strategies to gain market share and improve client acquisition rates is essential to advance your firm in today&rsquo;s economy. Strategic alliances help catalyze your firm&rsquo;s growth because they empower each partner to serve clients better. Through the alliance, your clients benefit from the expertise of trusted professionals and feel satisfied knowing you are working together as a team to help them achieve their financial goals.</p><li> <strong>  Marketing Tip </strong> : Structure your extended team. Start with other professionals; attorneys, insurance agents, and CPAs, whose efforts are symmetrical to the needs of your clients. Identify professionals that share your niche market and can provide solutions to your clients beyond your existing realm of services. Done correctly, it only takes a small number of strategic partners to have a positive impact.

    "content": "<p> Written by: Simon Begun | <u>  Econnexx </u></p><p> The role of video in projecting a message and generating interest is becoming increasingly more important. Today, more than ever, financial companies are finding that video can play a key role in generating clients. </p><p> Video provides financial firms with a means to boost their online presence, convert more leads, generate more clients and increase funds under management. Here's how:</p><h3> How To Use Video Marketing</h3><p> Financial firms, like any other business, are looking for better ways to communicate with current and prospective customers. Video marketing allows you to;</p><h3> Make your website more effective</h3><p> Video can make a big difference in the effectiveness of a website. Websites are designed to convey information and that&rsquo;s exactly what video does. Better still, information conveyed through video is easier to recall because the brain processes images faster than plain text.</p><p> By putting a 'call gate' on your video's you can ask the visitor to input their name and email address to view the full video. By doing this the visitor receives the value created from the video and your firm generates a contact with whom you can remain in contact with through a series of workflow emails and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/automated-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Automation marketing processes  </a> </u> .</p><p> When visitors are attracted to your firms website, they are likely to stay on your website longer giving you more time to communicate the value of your service and entice the visitor to take action. Video's help you achieve this.</p><h3> Tell your story</h3><p> Videos are also excellent media for telling stories. For instance, you can create an &ldquo;About Us&rdquo; page that demonstrates your firm&rsquo;s vision and philosophy. A number of firms are also using videos to allow current clients to share their experiences. Do you have a past or current client happy to testify about your services? Create a testimonial video and upload it to your website so that visitors can see exactly what you offer. Doing so has helped many financial firms create an aura of trust and expertise that leaves a lasting impression.</p><h3> Attract The Type of Clients You Want</h3><p> Creating a video that portrays a specific message, and designed to appeal to a particular client type enables you to be more specific, delivering better results. For instance, you can create a video about your process for ensuring results for clients, or the reasoning behind asset allocation. Consumers are busy individuals who don&rsquo;t have the time to investigate your services at depth. A short, on-point video will simplify their decision-making process, and attract them into your sales funnel.</p><h3> Become The Go-To Resource For News and Information</h3><p> Alongside your own videos, you can curate and publish other expert videos to market yourself as the primary resource for news, tips, and general information. Create videos that are interesting, relevant and valuable to your target audience. Video's are easily shared via social media and blog posts for maximum reach and effectiveness. </p><p> Remember that you don&rsquo;t always have to sound sales-driven; sharing videos that tell a story will help your firm attract visitors and entice those visitors to take action and make contact.</p>",

    "link": "the-best-things-in-business-are-free",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Negotiating for a lower price or something extra is the modus operandi of every antique retailer, real estate broker, flea market merchant and automobile dealer. Everyone is looking for a good deal, a real bargain. I&rsquo;m not taking issue with that. Bargaining is a terrific way to create and stimulate economies.</p><p> Everyone has heard the saying, &ldquo;the best things in life are free.&rdquo; That idiom was a line in a song from the 1920&rsquo;s but it is often attributed to Coco Chanel, who added a second sentence afterthought &ndash; &ldquo;the second best things are very, very expensive.&rdquo; Almost a century later, the best things in life continue to be free. The same can be said of business. I&rsquo;m not referring to a bunch of &ldquo;buy one get one free&rdquo; promotions or deep discount sales events. I&rsquo;m getting at the elements of business that drive superior performance at no extra cost.</p><p> For a moment, take a deep breath. Forget about throwing heaps of cash at such initiatives as computer systems, advertising, equipment, recruiting &ndash; even training. Stop worrying about low-cost foreign competition and the state of the economy or your industry. The best bargains in business are there to help you deal with any setback, and their associated costs can be unleashed from your existing overheads.</p><h3> Here are the 4 best bargains in business:</h3><p> <br/> 1.   <strong>  Leadership </strong> . A good leader costs as much as a bad one. The best leaders have the ability to instill clarity of vision and a compelling purpose that inspires people to make the extra effort. As we know, Steve Jobs wasn&rsquo;t the easiest guy to work with, but the results under Jobs? Outstanding.  Apple  employees believed in his vision, and delivered it over and over again. They still do.</p><p> 2.   <strong>  Culture </strong> . Culture takes time. But once you have a healthy culture, once you leverage it and enjoy the results, you are on your way. Culture is the state of mind that says, &ldquo;These are the things that really matter in this company. This is the way we do things around here.&rdquo; Mindsets are free. Some companies thrive on innovative cultures. Others pride themselves on getting the job done.  Zappos  and  Patagonia  believe that culture is the brand. When you get there, you&rsquo;ve nailed it.</p><p> 3.   <strong>  Simplicity </strong> . Organizations that insist on simplicity are generally the most successful. This is a corollary to leadership and strategy but it is also a core value that must permeate the entire organization. Everyone on the same page fighting complexity creates sustainable winners. The California-based In-N-Out Burger Chain is a wonderful example of keeping things simple and doing less, better. Just look at their menu &ndash; 3 burger choices, fries, shakes and soft drinks. If you want chicken, salad, pizza or wraps, go elsewhere.</p><p> 4.   <strong>  Creativity </strong> . While the above bargains don&rsquo;t have to cost extra money, they take considerable effort and in some cases, considerable time. This is not necessarily the case for creativity. The &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; and the process of creating and implementing the thought is one of the most unappreciated bargains in business. I spent an entire career espousing the power of creativity, and the companies I touched did very well by it. As for today,  Red Bull  and  Google  stand out as quintessential idea machines.</p><p> Whining about the economy, budget constraints, and low-cost competition does nothing to improve a company&rsquo;s strategic health. Businesses who live by these bargains are the ones who enjoy success &ndash; both in the journey and the bottom-line destination. But, beware. Bureaucracy lurks on the periphery, waiting for its opening to subvert the lean, mean, business machine.</p>",

    "link": "why-content-marketing-is-like-boxing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The competitive landscape surrounding marketing has become fierce to say the least, especially when you are held responsible for representing a brand while simultaneously having to generate demand.This constant pressure, competitiveness and strive to be the best in your respective industry has made me think about marketing more as a sport than a job. The similarities are striking. There is so much that goes into the preparation and execution, and although marketing shares characteristics that are present in almost every sport, boxing is a similarity that I think describes the field best.</p><h3> Assembling the Right Team</h3>Marketing has transformed into such a multifaceted animal that it takes more than one ace to win the match. Now in addition to the traditional offline materials, there are digital, video, content and social media marketing channels that need to be managed and built upon within a company in order for the most well-rounded, exceptional campaign to unfold. Think about it; a boxer wouldn&rsquo;t focus only on perfecting a left jab. That&rsquo;s not going to get him too far. Nor would a boxer only train solely in the ring. It&rsquo;s the combination of building endurance, learning new techniques and countless hours of practice that turns a novice into a repeat champion.As the shift towards content creation and engaging with current and potential audiences through owned media channels has transpired over the last few years, many brands have taken to reorganizing their marketing departments to mimic publishing offices. It takes creativity, expertise, sharp writing skills and, perhaps most of all, consistency, to achieve continued success and demand generation. Much like a boxer would rely on a manager, nutritionist, sparring partner and trainer, every new role within a marketing department is as important as the next.Some of the most vital, emerging roles in content marketing now include:<img alt=\"\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-10.51.43-AM.png\" width=\"569\"/><strong> Chief Content Officer</strong>: Much like a champion boxer&rsquo;s manager, the chief content officer&rsquo;s role is to oversee the entire operation of content marketing creation &mdash; ensuring that everything is being properly completed and meets brand-standards. This position is held accountable for the production and supervision of all digital content that is going to be used as part of a marketing campaign, and guaranteeing that every one else in the department is fulfilling their assigned roles.<strong> Managing Editor</strong>: Whereas the chief content officer is responsible for steering the ship, the managing editor&rsquo;s role is to implement the strategies. This includes creating original concepts, assigning out content and carefully reviewing all proposed materials. <u> <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/04/essential-roles-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Content Marketing Institute </a></u> describes this position as someone who works with the roles below to make the stories come alive, including tone, style guides and content scheduling.<strong> Creative Designer</strong>: A boxer&rsquo;s public persona is often influenced by those who surround him. Even the sharpest fighter in the ring needs a talented team in the background promoting fights, designing logos and arranging interviews. It&rsquo;s all part of a well devised media team. Similarly,while content marketing is focused on messaging, copy isn&rsquo;t the only vital component. Visuals have a tremendous impact on the influence and success of any campaign. In fact, according to <u> <a href=\"http://www.vocus.com/blog/visuals-make-big-impact-at-social-media-marketing-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Vocus and Social Media Examiner </a></u>, 70 percent of marketers are increasing their visual budgets because people see and retain visual content 500 percent faster than text alone.<strong> Customer Liaison</strong>: A brand can publish the most well written content, produce the most creative videos and create the most jaw-dropping graphics, but still manage to fall flat in demand generation. The reason? Failing to connect with their audience because they don&rsquo;t know who their audience really is and what their needs are. Just as a boxer needs to familiarize himself with his opponent to know the other fighter&rsquo;s signature moves, record of wins and weakest attributes, a proper content marketing team needs to have dedicated staff that are creating buyer personas, conducting focus groups and connecting with clients on a regular basis.<h3> Training for the Fight: Commitment</h3>The fastest way to lose a boxing match: stop throwing punches. The quickest way to sink a content marketing campaign: failure to publish new content.A boxer doesn&rsquo;t enter the ring for the first time ever on the night of the fight. No, he has spent days, weeks and months training for one single match. Winning takes determination. Muhammad Ali won 56 out of the 61 matches he entered into, and his career spanned 20 years. He certainly didn&rsquo;t become a legend by winning his first fight and leaving the sport. In that same respect, a brand can&rsquo;t expect to see exponential growth after just one published piece of content. Instead, content marketing works so well because it is based around building a relationship of trust and expertise with the audience. Your brand must become a source that viewers can expect to receive winning content from time and time again. When a consumer trusts a brand they are much more likely to return to the website on a continual basis and use the trusted brand&rsquo;s product over the competition. In fact, companies that blog have <u> <a href=\"http://www.impactbnd.com/blog/businesses-blog-get-more-visitors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  97% more inbound links </a></u> than those who don&rsquo;t.As a result of statistic like these, <u> <a href=\"http://www.onespot.com/content/content-marketing-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  79% of marketers&rsquo; </a></u> report that their organizations are shifting to branded content. This concept worked wonderfully for electronics brand Magnolia. Beyond selling electronics, the father-and-son run store produced a mini-magazine that attracted the attention of Best Buy, which eventually <u> <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2000/12/18/daily4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  acquired the brand for $87 million </a></u> and the company continues to <u> <a href=\"http://www.magnoliaav.com/m-magazine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  publish a magazine </a></u>. Talk about ROI.<h3> Anticipate Audiences&rsquo; Plan</h3>The most successful brands continually rise to the top of their markets because they address audience-need&rsquo;s as soon as they become a concern, and don&rsquo;t wait until the demand for a solution has become so elevated that the audience starts to look elsewhere for solutions. A prized fighter studies the techniques of his opponents, knows who the biggest competition is and plays close attention to the rising stars that have their eyes on the title.The first step is understanding the problems potential buyers are facing and reaching them in their preferred means of communication. <u> <a href=\"http://www.marketo.com/cheat-sheets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Marketo </a></u> helps marketers succeed in all area of their profession by covering topics such as content marketing, social media, email marketing, sales and marketing alignment and lead management. They are constantly taking the issues that plague their clients and creating content specifically geared towards helping them understand and achieve solutions. And the variety of content types on Marketo&rsquo;s website shows their dedication to innovation. Infographics, blog posts, eBooks, guides, cheat sheets, presentations, webinars &mdash; the list goes on.In addition to addressing current issues, a brand should be equally focused on anticipating upcoming trends. <u> <a href=\"https://blog.etsy.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Etsy </a></u>, a popular online curator, has a current editorial strategy that focuses on popular topics that shape every day. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very engaged with the lifestyle blogosphere &hellip; what other blogs are covering, and how can we play against that. A lot of it is trend watching &hellip; it&rsquo;s not like living in a bubble &mdash; you really have to keep your feelers out,&rdquo; editor-in-chief Alison Feldmann told <u> <a href=\"http://contently.com/strategist/2012/12/13/decoding-etsy-how-content-is-changing-the-way-we-shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Contently </a></u>.<h3> Keep Them on Their Toes</h3>Your content should be consistent, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be expected. The only thing that should be expected is that your company is portrayed as a reliable expert. However, there is no rule that explicitly mandates that you can only deliver this message in a singular fashion. A boxer with the same jab sequence might knock out an opponent or two, but the rest of the competitors would step into the ring knowing exactly what to expect. The sport, like your content, would lose its luster.One of the most successful ways for brands to create fresh content is to reutilize evergreen materials. You don&rsquo;t have to avoid a right hook in a match, you just need to make sure it comes when your opponent is least expecting it.KISSmetrics, for examples, started repurposing blog posts into 47 infographics. Even though the outline of the content had previously been made available to their audience, the new approach helped to generate <u> <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/10/22/why-content-marketing-is-the-new-seo/?__hstc=57324917.91f5fd9fa2aaadc39040896c1eb7045f.1406300329485.1406300329485.1406300329485.1&amp;__hssc=57324917.1.1406300329485&amp;__hsfp=3646839946\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2,512,596 visitors and 41,142 backlinks </a></u> from more than three thousand different sites.Social media channels are another steadfast way to reinvent, promote and add to content in order to entertain and engage with users. With 67% of adults now admittedly using social networking sites, there&rsquo;s a great chance your audience does, too. Adding imagery, creating teasers and using company-supported data can work to your advantage. As <u> <a href=\"https://www.prdaily.com/earned-media-vs-paid-media-a-7-point-list-of-benefits/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  PR Daily </a></u> explains, these types of earned media further fosters authentic conversations with your audience, enables a brand to deliver targeted messaging and can be distributed among an endless number of digital channels.And of course, any company not experimenting with video content creation is doing their brand a disservice. Video is one of the fastest growing segments of content marketing and one of the most influential, too. It&rsquo;s estimated that by 2017 <u> <a href=\"http://www.brainshark.com/Ideas-Blog/2014/March/ten-video-marketing-statistics-and-what-they-mean-to-you.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  74 percent </a></u> of all Internet traffic will be video. More and more companies are gravitating towards video because they are seeing it&rsquo;s positive impact. Worldwide, <strong> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brainshark.com/Ideas-Blog/2014/March/ten-video-marketing-statistics-and-what-they-mean-to-you.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   52 percent of marketing professionals  </a> </u>  named video as the type of content with the best ROI, and it&rsquo;s been reported that</strong> videos increase people&rsquo;s understanding of your product or service by <u> 74 percent</u>.If a proven technique is available that increases customer retention and turns interested parties into buying clients, why wouldn&rsquo;t a marketer take advantage? Yes, it may mean initially stepping out of your comfort zone, but the risks are worth the rewards. Again, this is similar to a boxer who only relies on a few proven fight sequences. Before long every opponent would be able to choreograph the fight and take the necessary precautions to dodge hooks and anticipate every upcoming move. A loss would be inevitable.<h3> You WILL Get Punched</h3><img alt=\"\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-10.41.53-AM.png\" width=\"516\"/>No boxer steps into the ring without the expectation that they are going to eventually take a punch. Sure, to the public they might say otherwise, but well-trained fighter&rsquo;s train not only to throw hard hits, but to receive them, too. And most importantly, they train for a quick recovery. The same is true for a comprehensive marketing plan. If you don&rsquo;t like how a fight is unfolding, or the response your company is receiving, change the conversation.This is exactly what McDonalds Canada did in response to negative press about the nutritional value of their food. Rather than turning the other cheek or dismissing the accusations in standard press statements, the food chain did something rather unexpected. They put the focus on the negative connotations associated with their brand and encouraged customers to submit inquiries. In fact, they <u> <a href=\"http://yourquestions.mcdonalds.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  launched a website </a></u> specifically targeted at answering food questions and debunking myths. By becoming transparent, the brand gained back the respect of their client-base.And even when a brand has regained or maintained a loyal customer base, it may still not be enough. Lincoln, for example, wanted to expand their target audience to include younger demographics who traditionally didn&rsquo;t make up a large sector of buyers. To do so they strayed from traditional print and TV advertising and created an interactive video campaign that they knew younger audiences would be more perceptive to. The campaign, <u> Dream Ride</u>, gave viewers the chance to experience a ride in a Lincoln luxury vehicle without the hassle of physically going the dealership. Once video users became interested in the brand and familiar with the speed and smooth handling of the Lincoln MKC that piqued their interests, they were more likely to take a true test drive away from the computer screen.Another crucial component to a content marketing plan and winning the fight to attract clients away from competitors is making sure your clients trust you. And in this regard, honesty is key. Rather than putting up a screen of smoke and mirrors, Chipotle addresses head on, with complete disclosure, the fact they were not always serving natural foods. They admitted that 12 of their 24 food items contained Genetically Modified Organisms and became the first United States restaurant to explicitly label foods containing GMOs on their menu for health-conscious diners. While this honesty turned some customers away, Chipotle embraced their faults and, as <u> <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:q_wSVjWaa_8J:cmexaminer.cadence9.com/content-marketing-lifecycle/the-power-of-perception-and-sensation-in-content-marketing/&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;strip=0&amp;vwsrc=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Content Marketing Examiner </a></u> applauds, repaired their brand image by launching a marketing campaign that generated awareness by striking an emotional chord with viewers through an app and videos.<img alt=\"\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-10.15.28-AM.png\" width=\"847\"/>click to watch<h3> Win the Match, Not Just the Round</h3>Boxing matches are not just about the first round. While some fighters might achieve a knockout within the first few minutes, and some companies might achieve over night success, the majority of fights go more than a single round. Championship matches have 12 rounds and marketing calendars have 12 months. Each round, like each new month, must build upon previous successes, rebound from mishaps and strive towards reaching the end as the triumphant victor. For a boxer this of course means hearing the final bell and being declared the title-holder. For marketing execs it means watching demand generation grow and meeting and succeeding marketing expectations for their brand. In either instance, once one match or year ends, there is the right amount of celebration, but ultimately the focus returns to the next match, the next year, the next strategy for success.<img alt=\"\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-10.48.38-AM.png\" width=\"509\"/>When it comes to being a marketing savant, don&rsquo;t be afraid to take chances. Educate yourself on the ever-changing landscape of the industry and go for the knockout. You&rsquo;re here to win the match, not just a round.",

    "content": "<p> Can I be painfully honest with you for a moment? Can I say something that will quite likely make you mad?</p><p> Prepare to be shocked.</p><p> You know how you&rsquo;ve been struggling to help more people with your financial planning service? Tried everything, and it&rsquo;s just not working?</p><p> Well, it&rsquo;s not because people don&rsquo;t trust you. It&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re too expensive. It&rsquo;s not because people don&rsquo;t understand what the benefit of financial planning is.</p><p> It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been holding off telling you for years now, hoping somebody would do the dirty work for me. Because it takes real guts to say something like this. But no one has. So, out of respect for you, I want to tell you the truth.</p><p> So, here it is:</p><p> It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re ignorant.</p><h3> Did I Just Call You Ignorant?</h3><p> <br/> Yes. I&rsquo;m sorry. And no, I&rsquo;m not talking about IQ or your analytical qualities. Because those are outstanding.</p><p> Yet, I understand if you&rsquo;ll never visit my blog again after this verdict. Because you might be part of the financial-planner-minority who has a meaningful impact on hundreds, maybe thousands of people with your financial planning service.</p><p> The rest of you though?</p><p> To you, I&rsquo;m pleading. And I&rsquo;m doing it out of love. Because you see, most people have been lying to you. Maybe even your parents. If people ever said these things to you, then you&rsquo;ll know: </p><p> &ldquo;To earn a decent living, you need a college degree&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Knowledge is power&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a job-guarantee when you&rsquo;ll pass your CFP-exam&rdquo;</p><p> If you ever had this advice, then welcome to my world. Because this is what my dad always told me.  &ldquo;Ronald, you need to get good grades and go to college and pursue a profession that delivers a decent living.&rdquo;</p><p> Now my dad has been a poulterer (a dealer in poultry) his whole life. And he still is. He&rsquo;s now 64 and at the end of next year he&rsquo;s going to retire. And he&rsquo;s really looking forward to it.</p><p> And I&rsquo;m proud of him. I respect him. He has built a successful business from the ground up. Just like many others of his generation he has worked really, really hard to earn a living. And I don&rsquo;t know what you consider as &ldquo;working hard&rdquo; but I believe &ldquo;working hard&rdquo; is when you work 6 days a week with the worry of staff, the bookkeeping and all the other worries of a small business entrepreneur.</p><br /><p> And I think I understand why he gave me his advice to get good grades and to look for a decent job. I believe he didn&rsquo;t want me to work as a poulterer, because he knew what I had to do to have a decent living if I became a poulterer too. I believe he didn&rsquo;t want that for me.</p><p> I think he wanted me to become successful by using my brains. And luckily for him (and for me of course), I was a smart kid. I was good at school and I was especially good with numbers. And because of my number-skills it was to be expected that I become an accountant, or an actuary, or a financial planner.</p><p> And there&rsquo;s a reason why people like my dad believe that financial planners are, by definition, successful.</p><p> It&rsquo;s because &ldquo;it has always been this way&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s because people have this worldview that you still have an information advantage. It&rsquo;s because you know things, most people don&rsquo;t know. And you can make a good living out of it, because people are willing to pay for the information they don&rsquo;t have. In other words, they pay you for your knowledge.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why professor Peter Drucker gave these professions a somewhat wanky name: knowledge workers.</p><p> Knowledge workers are people who get paid for putting to work what one learns in school rather than for their physical strength or manual skill</p><p> Now, that is exactly what my dad wanted me to be: a knowledge worker.</p><p> However, compared with the time when I was a kid and today, there has been a major change in the supply of knowledge and information. For most planners these developments are changing the emphasis of financial planning. Away from left-brained routine, analytical and information-based work. Toward right-brained empathy, narrative finance and comprehensive care.</p><h3> And It&rsquo;s Not Just That</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s Seth Godin:</p><p> Most of your customers have a very simple default frame. If it&rsquo;s not remarkable or exceptional, ignore it2</p><p> If you want to have a thriving financial planning service, you need to get smarter. No, not smarter as in pursuing another financial-planning-degree. What I&rsquo;m referring to, is leaving people with a mind-blowing experience.</p><p> Like when seeing Marilyn Monroe for the first time and thinking, &ldquo;Thank you, my Lord.&rdquo;</p><p> Like when people having a conversation with you and walk away thinking, &ldquo;Holy crap, that financial planner is amazing!&rdquo;</p><p> Like when people come away from your conversation with a whole new perspective.</p><p> And I hear you think: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessarily smart. That&rsquo;s just using your skills.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s all it is. Just a few examples:</p><li> Smart planners are able to  find  people&rsquo;s problems by asking the right questions</li><li> The things smart planners say are truly original. People have never heard it anywhere before. Ever</li><li> People find themselves thinking about things these planners said weeks or even years into the future <br/>  </li><p> These planners are building magical connections with the right people, and doing work that really matters because they are having an impact. Bottom line is that these planners are truly smart financial planners because they understand what needs to be done to matter.</p><p> On the flipside, there&rsquo;s &lsquo;the rest&rsquo; who are some combination of unoriginal, boring, or even forgettable planners.</p><p> So, it&rsquo;s time to ask yourself the question: Which group do you want to belong to?</p><h3> The Truth About Smart Financial Planners</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not only about the work you do. It&rsquo;s also about who you want to become.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re smart, it&rsquo;s relatively easy. Your work, your conversations and your relationships are like a strike of lightning. People instantly start talking about you. And referrals will flood your inbox.</p><p> But if you&rsquo;re not smart?</p><p> It&rsquo;s nearly impossible. You can do everything the educators and regulators tell you to do, and you can do it absolutely correctly, and you&rsquo;ll still fail.</p><p> So, does that mean you won&rsquo;t be able to help more people with your service? Not necessarily. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t about genetics. This isn&rsquo;t about inborn talent. This isn&rsquo;t about fate.</p><p> It&rsquo;s about deciding who you want to be and then making yourself into that smart planner.</p><h3> How To Make Yourself Smarter</h3><p> <br/> I was not what you would call a very smart person. I was &ldquo;just&rdquo; a financial planner. And just like most of you, for years I&rsquo;d been building my knowledge with the goal of helping more people. In fact, I always thought that people would hire me because of my degrees and extensive knowledge.</p><p> But after 12 years of following rigorous financial planning programs, I got fed up with myself.  Because I realised these programs didn&rsquo;t help me one bit to have more impact. I realized these programs wouldn&rsquo;t help me to serve more people and to have a thriving financial planning service. I realized there was more to it, than &ldquo;doing my work and following the rules.&rdquo;</p><p> So, I decided to change things.</p><p> Instead of reading tax-magazines, I read business books. Instead of listening to my manager, I listened to audio-books. On the weekends, I stopped writing left-brained summaries, and started writing about right-brain potential. Nobody told me to do it, but I  knew  I had to do  something different  to have an impact. To make financial planning matter.</p><p> And a crazy thing happened. Within a year people started to call me an expert, asking me for advice, inviting me for conferences all over the world.</p><p> Now, you may think this is awesome. I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t want to be seen as &ldquo;smart&rdquo;?</p><p> However, I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the unexpected. So, if you don&rsquo;t want to make the same mistake I did, here&rsquo;s my advice:</p><h3> Be Prepared For Resistance</h3><p> <br/> More than likely, the financial planner you are right now is going to have severe problems becoming a smarter financial planner.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because your environment, your peers, and even the industry won&rsquo;t support you. They&rsquo;ll call you strange, off-balance, maybe even soft, or fluffy. They&rsquo;ll resist who you are becoming. They&rsquo;ll resist you becoming smarter.</p><p> First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win ~ Mahatma Gandhi2</p><p> But don&rsquo;t blame them. Because these people don&rsquo;t know that it takes more than building your knowledge and analytical qualities.</p><p> You see, probably 95% of every financial planning program is about tax, numbers, laws, mathematics, investment strategies or other left-brained essentials. So, you can&rsquo;t blame them for not knowing, when financial planners have been brainwashed by our educational system. Because the system teaches us that left-brain-knowledge-building is a gateway for success.</p><p> Sure, this may be true when you have an information advantage, when knowledge is scarce, when you still live in the 80s.</p><p> But what happens when every bit of information is just one swipe away?</p><h3> Do You Want To Know What&rsquo;s Really Painful?</h3><p> <br/> If you want to be a smarter planner, you have to stop spending time with people who used to be of great value to you.</p><p> Why?</p><p> As Jim Rohn famously said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no scientific evidence I know of to support him, but pretty much every successful person will tell you it&rsquo;s true.1</p><p> I&rsquo;d be lying to you if I said this was going to be easy, but if you want to become a smarter planner, you have to become something new, change the way you think, how you talk, and yes, leave people who still believe in old-school paradigms.</p><p> Want to become a smarter financial planner?</p><p> Find planners that are a little better than you are, online, in real life, wherever, and become friends with them. Exchange work, give feedback, talk to them.</p><p> At first, it might be painful. You&rsquo;ll feel like a child going to school for the first time. Eventually though, you&rsquo;ll get smarter, just by hanging around with them.</p><h3> And After A While You&rsquo;ll Find Out</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;ll find out that if you want to be a smarter financial planner, it&rsquo;s not sufficient anymore to only focus on your existing qualities. If you want to be smarter, you need to fulfill your potential. Or, as I like to call it: your  right-brain  potential.</p><p> That means not just using argument, but starting to use story. Not only giving advice based on logic, but also on empathy. Not just accumulating wealth, but also meaning. Not just service, but also giving. Not just function, but also design.</p><p> It will change you. Drastically. You&rsquo;ll still be you, but you&rsquo;ll be a better version of you. And you&rsquo;ll see the results.</p><p> Where your service used to get a half-hearted response, you&rsquo;ll start getting compliments. Where people used to ignore you, they&rsquo;ll suddenly give you a call. Where you used to only see small growth, your business will thrive within a year.1</p><p> Not because you&rsquo;re using some sort of technique.</p><p> It&rsquo;ll happen because you are smart. Slowly and painfully, you&rsquo;ll transform into someone worth listening to.</p><p> Are you ready to be this smart?</p><p> Or are you going to be just another ignorant financial planner?</p><p> The choice is yours.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s make financial planning matter.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Taxi for the B2B Salesperson?</h3><p> <br/> In Forrester&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/US+B2B+eCommerce+Forecast+2015+To+2020/fulltext/-/E-RES115957\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   US B2B eCommerce Forecast: 2015 to 2020  </a> </u>  they quote that &ldquo;74% of B2B buyers research, at least one-half of their work purchases online. In addition, 30% of today&rsquo;s B2B buyers complete at least half of their work purchases online. With that percentage nearly doubling to 56% by 2017, B2B sellers will see a significant volume of offline business move online in the next few years.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Taking those facts further, at the recent Forrester&rsquo;s Sales Enablement Forum , a study by  <u>  Andy Hoar, Principal Analyst at Forrester </u> , revealed that he expected 22% of B2B Sales jobs go by 2020.  With Enterprise purchases taking place online this means the traditional B2B sales person is being replaced by Search Engines, YouTube, websites etc.  The Diagram top left is Forester&rsquo;s view on how what will replace the B2B Sales person.</p><h3> Are Things Really that Bad?</h3><p> <br/> Recently talking to a friend of mine who works for an &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; Cloud technology company, they relayed this story.  An inbound sales call, that went like this;</p><p> <strong>  Caller: </strong>  &ldquo;We want to buy your product, can you tell me how much it is please?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Salesperson: </strong>  &ldquo;Er, OK, but how can this be, don&rsquo;t you want a demo?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Caller: </strong>  &ldquo;No, we have done our research for a new product online and we watched your demos on Youtube.  We have decided yours is the best, so we just need to check it meets our budget and then we would like to go ahead.&rdquo;</p><p> This means that 90% of the research has taken place on-line.</p><p> This conversation, (let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s an exception) seems to back up the Forrester research, but could Forrester be understating things?  In my experience in talking and working with companies we (in sales) have reached a tipping point.</p><h3> What Does that Mean for us B2B Sales People?</h3><p> <br/> Not sure if my friend had realised but she had gone from being a (in my opinion a highly respected) B2B Salesperson to an Order Taker.  Nothing wrong in being an order taker, but when most of us started out on the road into sales, it wasn&rsquo;t where we want to be.  So Where do we go from here?</p><h3> &ldquo;Move up, Move down or Get Out&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> I was once given some advice when it comes to significant moves in the market; &ldquo;Move up, Move down or get out&rdquo;.  You can apply that to this situation. The &ldquo;Boston Square&rdquo; on the left from  <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Forrester </a>  shows how Salespeople and Sales organisations need to organise themselves as the market shifts to be completely buyer centric.  </p><p> With people getting more used to, and more comfortable with, buying (high value) B2B products over the web.  With technical details, pricing, and product demos all available over the web, I can see a continuation of the commoditisation of the buying process.</p><p> Sales people need to raise their game and while not be Thought Leaders, they need to be a &ldquo;beacon&rdquo; in their given niche and or industry.</p><p> If you are in sales, here is some good news, or at least a solution.</p><h3> What Does a B2B SalesPerson Need to do So They Don&rsquo;t Become Irrelevant?</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s look at that Data from Forrester in more detail (Just remember this is US data, as I write for a global audience, you can question this is the same in your geography, but in the UK where I live, where the US leads, the UK will follow).  See panel below. It&rsquo;s all doom and gloom apart from one area. <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-11.15.33-AM.png\" width=\"627\"/></p><p> Let me repeat what Forrester say &hellip;.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;&rdquo;Consultants,&rdquo; who have extensive knowledge about the buyer&rsquo;s company to help the buyer understand what her company needs to purchase. Job gain: 10%, to 550,000 from 500,000.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Companies need to undertake a major transformation of their sales force.  One tactic of that will be to undertake a Strategic Social Selling program (starting, obviously, at the top management) and employee advocacy program across your organisation.</p><p> <strong>  The Harvard Business Review puts it more eloquently  </strong> <br/>   <br/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-11.15.29-AM.png\" width=\"668\"/></p><h3> More Details of the Forrester Report</h3><p> <br/> Forrester says the biggest impact will be on sales reps at wholesalers and distributors, but less so in such industries as high-tech manufacturers and providers of healthcare technology.</p><p> Forrester indicates that trend toward more self-service online research and ordering is only likely to increase as more companies that sell to businesses and government agencies get more into e-commerce.  In many cases for B2B buyers, Hoar says, e-commerce &ldquo;has taken away the need to talk to someone to explain things.&rdquo;</p><h3> Reduce your Cost per Sales Transaction from $24.48 to $1.50 &hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Another trend contributing to the shift to self-service e-commerce is the increased efficiency online order brings to sellers&mdash;for example,  through lower employee costs and overall operating expenses, Forrester says. &ldquo;A company we interviewed estimates that it reduced its cost per order from $24.48 per transaction via a salesperson-driven paper-based ordering system to $1.50 per transaction via a customer self-serve e-commerce,&rdquo; the report says.</p><p> Forrester also notes, that B2B buyers will continue to purchase through sales reps in certain situations, such as for complex products and systems procured across large enterprises. Yet even in these situations, communications between buyer and reps are going more digital, Hoar says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re increasingly conducting those negotiations with salespeople by way of digital means such as email, [live] chat, and collaborative software as opposed to via a traditional phone call,&rdquo; the report says.  For example, I&rsquo;m aware of a company that purchased a $350,000 product via Skype, no face to face meetings took place.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Establishing an open line of communication with employees is one factor that can lead to business success. Good leaders acknowledge the fact that communicating with their workers effectively plays an important role on building trust between them and the employees, which can eventually boost their engagement and overall performance.</p><p> As a leader, what should you do to make sure your communication with your people is helping and not hurting engagement? Here are some guidelines to follow:</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get more personal.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s always good for leaders to know and interact with their employees on a more personal level. When having a conversation with them, try to focus on them as the topic of your communication. You can easily get their attention if you can make them feel that you are interested to know them more.</p><h3> 2. Demonstrate to them your passion.</h3><p> <br/> When employees feel and see how dedicated their leader is to the organization, they will be inspired to be the same, too. Communicate with them in a way that you can share your passion about the services or the products your company is offering. By showing them commitment to your customers, you can expect them to have the same commitment for quality customer service as well.</p><h3> 3. Ask for feedback and listen.</h3><p> <br/> People who are gifted with great leadership skills are aware that effective communication is a two-way street. It&rsquo;s important that you show how willing you are to listen to what your employees have to say by asking for employee feedback. You can start by conducting an employee engagement survey by which you can gather and analyze information from your employees. This will make them feel that their opinions matter. And of course, don&rsquo;t forget to act on whatever feedback you receive. There is no point in asking for their feedback if you&rsquo;re not going to do anything about it.</p><h3> 4. Recognize good work and performance.</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no doubt that recognition, or lack of it, has a great impact on employees&rsquo; level of engagement. As a matter of fact, studies show that being unrecognized or unappreciated is one of the main reasons employees leave their employers. Thus, you have to find ways to communicate the value of your employees by praising them or giving out rewards.</p><h3> 5. Have a positive presence in the workplace.</h3><p> <br/> Always think about how your communication affects your employees&rsquo; feelings. Does it make them inspired or confident or perhaps disheartened? If you want to avoid radiating negativity in the workplace, always have a positive attitude towards all your interactions with your employees.</p><p> Communication is an important tool for creating a trusting and productive relationship between employers and employees.  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/mentor-program-details/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Good leadership  </u>    </a> is also judged by how this type of communication affects employee engagement, workplace productivity, and business success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DevinACarroll\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Devin Carroll  </a> </u> | <a href=\"http://www.socialsecurityintelligence.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Social Security Intelligence  </u> </a>  </p><p> The experts are here. And more are on the way. Waves of financial advisors and insurance agents.  Armed with slick software and annuity applications.</p><p> Their expertise?   Social Security.</p><p> You should hide your parents&hellip;or yourself if you&rsquo;re the target.</p><p> My bet is that it&rsquo;s just getting started.  <strong>  Over the next 17 years there will be 10,000 people per day who turn 65 </strong> .  Most of these people will all ask the same question, <strong>  &ldquo;When should I file for Social Security?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Recognizing this tsunami of retirees, financial services firms want their agents and advisors to help answer this question.  They&rsquo;ve invested millions of dollars into software development so their representatives can position themselves as experts.</p><p> Why?  It&rsquo;s pretty simple.  These big firms understand that applying for Social Security is usually one of the first of many big retirement decisions.  They understand that if you seek them out for Social Security advice, they&rsquo;re in a good position to hit you with an investment pitch.</p><p> Bait and switch?  Not exactly, but here&rsquo;s the problem.  <strong>  Most advisors and insurance salesman do not understand how Social Security works. </strong>   There&rsquo;s a reason that SSA.Gov is a 93,000 page website and that there are almost 3,000 filing rules.  It&rsquo;s complex!</p><p> As the population ages, there will be a need for good advisors who understand Social Security with all of its nuances.  The good news is, there are good advisors now&hellip;you just have to know how to find them.</p><p> Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not as simple as inquiring as to their degree or designation. To my knowledge there are no legitimate classes or schools that can teach an advisor everything they need to know to help clients with Social Security.  For the most part, advisors have to learn the Social Security rules on their own.  Surprise!  They don&rsquo;t teach us this stuff in school!</p><p> Since there are no real Social Security schools, the burden is on YOU to perform due diligence and sleuth your way to determining the advisor&rsquo;s expertise.</p><p> How are you supposed to do that?  Well, you need to ask some questions.  But before you get to the heavy questions, here is the one question that will help you narrow the field.</p><h3> How much does it cost?</h3><p> <br/> If they offer this planning for no charge, don&rsquo;t get close!  It&rsquo;s tempting I know.  But if they offer Social Security consulting for &ldquo;free&rdquo; there will most likely be an investment pitch tied to it.</p><p> Once they have passed this test it&rsquo;s time to find out how competent they are.  You should ask them a starter question like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best age to file?&rdquo;  If they give you some rule of thumb answer (e.g. 66 years old), they DON&rsquo;T know Social Security beyond a surface level.   Their answer to that question should be something like, &ldquo;Every situation is different; your best age to file is based on a combination of personal factors.&rdquo;</p><p> If they do ok with that question, hit them with a few more like, &ldquo;How much will my benefit increase between age 62 and my full retirement age?&rdquo;  &ldquo;What is a restricted application?&rdquo;  &ldquo;What are the length of marriage rules?&rdquo;  These are VERY basic questions that any advisor who dispenses Social Security advice will be comfortable and confident in answering immediately.  There should be NO bumbling around or &ldquo;let me check and call you back&rdquo; answers on these simple questions.</p><p> <strong>  If they do, look elsewhere! </strong></p><p> So the next time you see an invitation to that &ldquo;free&rdquo; dinner and Social Security seminar, just take your antacids and appetite.  Leave your financial information at home.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennifertouma\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jennifer Touma  </a> </u> | <a href=\"http://mindscapemind.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mindscape  </u> </a>  </p><p> What do business leaders need to effectively compete and succeed in today&rsquo;s uncertain business environment?</p><p> Today&rsquo;s business leaders need more than leadership skills, critical thinking, and the ability to influence and keep their team motivated. Successful business leaders need to have the same mental readiness and psychological toughness as the most dedicated athlete. It&rsquo;s the most valuable tool used in any life decision, in or out of the boardroom.</p><p> The Mental Toughness approach is the one overriding psychological asset that individuals, leaders and organizations depend on to carry them through critical moments of performance. It is the one attribute needed in today&rsquo;s workplace to improve the productivity and quality of leadership, make the most of present opportunities, and creating opportunity where none exists.</p><h3> What is Mental Toughness?</h3><p> <br/> Mental Toughness is the ability to manage emotions, thoughts and actions, and how an individual responds to stressors, challenges and pressure regardless of prevailing circumstances.</p><p> Mental toughness is a learned skill, developed through experiences, deliberateness of purpose, and awareness. This learned skill is fast becoming the competitive edge for athletes, business professionals, and in life in general today.</p><h3> Leadership Performance</h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s leaders have taken a brutal pounding in the marketplace due to its rising complexity over the last few years. Even those who are succeeding are experiencing emotional and psychological exhaustion.</p><p> But what makes one leader highly effective and another average, given the same situation?</p><p> Leaders today cannot rely only on their knowledge, skills and past successes to traverse through today&rsquo;s business paradigm of constant changeovers.</p><p> They must draw on psychological preparedness, a toughness that gets them through when they feel they are close to folding under the pressure. This toughness pushes them through hard &ldquo;bumps in the road&rdquo;, responding decisively and confidently to sudden, unforeseen challenges. Toughness helps leaders outperform competitors by remaining consistently focused, confident, and in emotional control.</p><p> Steve Bergholtz, senior facilities consultant for AmSan Division of Interline Brands in Danvers, MA, says, &ldquo;The only control you have is how you respond to the situation or challenge, so respond with a positive mindset.&rdquo;</p><p> As businesses look to their future, they need to prepare their most game-ready leaders to have &ldquo;deep smarts&rdquo; &ndash; insight based on know-how and mental toughness.</p><h3> Four Critical Mental Toughness Markers for Leaders</h3><p> <br/> Dr. Peter Clough, Head of Applied Psychology at University of Hull, is the foremost authority on mental toughness. As you peruse each of my expanded versions of Dr. Clough&rsquo;s definitions of four critical mental toughness markers, ask yourself, &ldquo;Am I mentally tough enough?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Control.   <br/>  Identifies the extent to which an individual feels in control of their life and emotions. </strong></p><p> Game-ready leaders feel in control of their life and their emotions. They keep anxieties in check and are less likely to reveal their emotional state to others. They manage themselves by taking charge of self, so that the situation, circumstances, and others don&rsquo;t.</p><p> A lack of self-control allows unrestrained behavioral practices to take control of life, resulting in &lsquo;crashing&rsquo; under job stresses, manifesting erratic behaviors, sudden emotional outbursts, dramatic mood swings, workplace bullying. What results are career derailments and self-sabotaging behaviors.</p><p> TIP: Ease stress by coping with problems directly and quickly rather than allowing them to control emotions, behaviors and health.</p><p> <strong>  Challenge.  <br/>  Identifies the extent to which people see challenges, variety and problems as opportunities or as threats. </strong>   <br/> <br/> Game-ready leaders see challenges and problems as opportunities and actively embrace them. They learn how to thrive within the constant flux in the business environment.</p><p> Leaders readily &ldquo;rise to the occasion&rdquo; in their hiring practices, managing a diverse generational workforce from millennials&rsquo; to baby boomers.</p><p> By contrast, not applying mental toughness contributes to a lack of preparation to deal with the &lsquo;unexpected&rsquo;, leading to deliberately ignoring crisis situations.</p><p> The most daunting of all challenges is facing fear, based on real or imagined threats. Leaders who feel fear are apprehensive of the unknown and the lack of control it represents. Leaders may fear making the wrong decision, giving performance feedback to an employee, or leading a meeting of peers. Organizations may fear budget cuts, reorganization, or a lack of resources to meet the needs of employees and customers.</p><p> As a result, leaders hesitate to pursue relationships, invest in business opportunities, and follow through on visions and goals.</p><p> Game-ready leaders know that fortunes are made when people take chances. Remarkable achievements come through acts of courage. Speculative risks gain windfalls from a leap of faith.</p><p> Game-ready leaders know &ldquo;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,&rdquo; words first spoken by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p><p> TIP:  At the first sign of emotional pressure, ask yourself, &ldquo;Am I allowing events, challenges or circumstances to control how I emotionally respond?&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Commitment.  <br/>  Identifies the extent to which someone commits to delivering what has been promised. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Game-ready leaders have an unwavering emotional and intellectual commitment to delivering what has been promised. Commitment represents the stick-ability to carry out a task in the face of difficulties or setbacks. Commitment means persisting to achieve business and personal goals. Game-ready leaders build trusting relationships to inspire commitment, even though commitment makes us vulnerable to rejection and failure.</p><p> TIP: Connect work with meaning, combining the rational and emotional commitment of leaders and employees in ways that lead to extraordinary effort.</p><h3> <strong>  Confidence.  <br/>  Identifies the extent to which people have self-belief in their abilities and the confidence to deal with setbacks and challenge. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Game-ready leaders gain confidence from achievement. They internalize a strong set of ethics, engage in effective self-management of emotions and behavior, and express principles of right conduct.</p><p> Confidence is thinking what one can do now, in the moment. By evaluating past accomplishments and experiences as successful, confidence increases. Confidence is standing up to complex challenges that lack the simple black-and-white answers. Confidence helps in coping with counterproductive emotions and thoughts.</p><p> Not applying mental toughness erodes a leader&rsquo;s confidence because they play the game of business and life so as not to lose. They deliberately move away from what they want, avoid taking calculating risks or accepting new tasks, making &lsquo;because&rsquo; excuses, and fearing success.</p><p> Game-ready leaders remain confident no matter the time or circumstances.:</p><p> TIP: Persistent pursuit of setting realistic and balanced goals.</p><p> <strong>  Question: What could happen in your life and career if you could push through the hard situations when you might otherwise feel like folding under pressure?  </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> There are a number of legitimate ways to approach a website redesign. Many companies start with customer and website design trend research, as well as taking a look at how the technical side of website design has changed over the years.</p><p> But when the time comes to start a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/website-design/website-redesign\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   website redesign  </a> </u> , there&rsquo;s one more secret we want to clue you in on: you can learn an awful lot about your customer, your industry, and what your website redesign needs by looking at your competitor&rsquo;s website.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t a suggestion for fly-by-night copying. Far from it, this is an opportunity to use your competitor&rsquo;s website to help you narrow down your likes, dislikes, and insights and create a website that is even better than the one you have now.</p><p> Ready to analyze? Here are four questions you can ask yourself to glean valuable insights from your competitor&rsquo;s website:</p><h3> What do you like and dislike about your competitor&rsquo;s website?</h3><p> <br/> Many aspects of a website redesign shouldn&rsquo;t be up to your opinion. After all, you want to meet the needs of your target audience, right?</p><p> Specific colors, frequency of blog posts, and placement of calls-to-action are targeted marketing tools that need to abide by the best practices of current marketing science.</p><p> However, some things are up for your discretion. And that can be a very powerful feeling&hellip; but only if you know what you like. Instead of making decisions based on a general theory of what you like and don&rsquo;t like in website design, take a look at your competitor&rsquo;s website to see it in real life and register your initial reaction.</p><p> Things you should pay attention to are particular color themes (your company style guide may define these for you, but you may have some leeway), helpful visitor features, styles of photos, styles and types of buttons, treatment of social media, and so on.</p><p> By perusing your competitor&rsquo;s website, you can make a list of these details that rub you the right or wrong way and make educated decisions about your design options.  <strong>  What are the things that you know your competitor is doing right? Wrong? </strong></p><h3> What&rsquo;s missing from your website now?</h3><p> <br/> The second reason you should tour your competitor&rsquo;s website before you move forward with a website redesign is that you often don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re missing until you see it somewhere else. Viewing someone else&rsquo;s ideas and approaches in a new context can help you identify things that you want to improve on your own website.</p><p> For example, you might be trying to get more email newsletter signups, and you noticed that your competitors seem to grow their lists without a problem. Go and find out what they&rsquo;re doing and see if it sparks any ideas for you. Sign up for their newsletter. Evaluate where they list the signup opportunities, how they tout it on their website, and how frequently they send updates.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t copy what they&rsquo;re doing, but use their websites to get a feel for how other companies are doing it and to inspire new ideas for how you can use it, too.  <strong>  What things do you need to add to your website to make it a useful resource for your prospective customers? </strong></p><h3> What do your customers want and not want?</h3><p> <br/> Your competitor&rsquo;s website can act as your R&amp;D if you pay careful attention. They have a similar target market, a similar product or service, and they might be constantly trying out new things.</p><p> Keep an eye on how their website changes over time for clues to how their website is working for them &mdash; and for their customer. Do you see any particular promotions that resonate with customers in the form of social media engagement and sales? Or do you see things that fall flat? These are all signs that these strategies might (or might not) work for you.  <strong>  What changes have you noticed with your competitor&rsquo;s website over time? Why do you think those changes were made? </strong></p><h3> How does their site compare to yours?</h3><p> <br/> Finally, you can get a customer&rsquo;s first-person view of how your competitor&rsquo;s website compares to yours by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/user-testing-your-competitors-website-to-improve-your-own/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   user testing your competitors&rsquo; websites  </a> </u>  for design ideas. This is a great (and legal) way to do a little espionage and find how your competitor&rsquo;s website meets the needs of your customers in a way that yours doesn&rsquo;t&hellip; Or vice versa.</p><p> In the end, you get high-quality intelligence about the performance both your website and your competitor&rsquo;s, and you can use this information to inform your website redesign.</p><p> You can also use  <u>  <a href=\"https://marketing.grader.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Grader.com  </a> </u>  to &ldquo;grade&rdquo; both your website and your competitor&rsquo;s website. Using this free tool, you can compare your websites on a number of criteria and learn where your website might be deficient.</p><p> <strong>  How do you think your ideal customer would react to your company website and your competitor&rsquo;s website side by side? </strong></p><p> Are you preparing for a website redesign? Do your competitive research and use these ideas to make sure your final website exceeds your customer&rsquo;s needs&hellip; Using your competitor&rsquo;s website for ideas!</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Legendary filmmaker  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Nichols\" target=\"_blank\">   Mike Nichols  </a> </u>  passed away in November, 2014 of a heart attack.  The well-known and respected artist, producer and director was 83 years old and was survived by his wife  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Sawyer\" target=\"_blank\">  Diane Sawyer </a>  and three children.Many knew Nichols for directing  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Graduate  </u>    </a> starring  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dustin Hoffman  </a> </u> .  Yet the prolific movie director had several other notable films under his belt including  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061184/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Virginia Wolf?  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065528/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Catch-22  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115685/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Birdcage  </a> </u>  and his final film,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Charlie Wilson&rsquo;s War  </a> </u> .   Additionally, during his lifetime, Nichols received an Academy award, a Grammy award, four Emmy awards and nine Tony awards.When the iconic director passed away, Nichols&rsquo; estate was reportedly worth $20 million.  While fans around the world mourned the loss of one of film&rsquo;s most revered directors, many have wondered if Nichols had a sound estate plan in place, especially after the deaths of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000450/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Philip Seymour Hoffman  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001254/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   James Gandolfini  </a> </u> &mdash;two celebrities who made some glaring estate planning mistakes.</p><h3> As details start to emerge about the late filmmakers&rsquo; estate,</h3>it seems that he was in fact a savvy estate planner.  His estimated $20 million fortune was left to his wife Diane Sawyer and three children.  Since Mike and Diane cherished their privacy, Mike went through great lengths to keep his assets and property away from the public eye.  What is known from his <u> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  will </a></u>, which was filed in the <u> <a href=\"http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/\" target=\"_blank\">  Manhattan Surrogate&rsquo;s Court </a></u>, is that he left all <u> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangible-personal-property.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  tangible property </a></u> including home furnishings, automobiles, boats, jewelry, pictures, clothing and other art to Diane.Additionally, Nichols&rsquo; left a <u> <a href=\"http://www.john-frederick-herring.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  J.F. Herring </a></u> painting titled &ldquo;Horse with Groom&rdquo; to his son <u> <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629658/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Max Nichols </a></u>.  Mike Nichols&rsquo; will, which was filed last May, explains that the rest of the filmmaker&rsquo;s fortunate will go into a <u> <a href=\"/category/solutions/estate-planning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  private trust </a></u>.  Court documents show that Diane Sawyer, Max and Nichols&rsquo; two daughters are <u> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  beneficiaries </a></u> of the fund, but it does not detail how the money will be divided.<h3> Nichols should be applauded for the way he handled his estate plan for a few reasons.</h3>First, by creating a private trust, he ensured that his legacy and how it was divided would remain private (or as private as possible given the investigative prowess and commitment of today&rsquo;s journalists).  Second, Nichols appointed his wife, Diane Sawyer, as the overseer of his estate.  Also, Nichols signed his estate less than a year before his death.  Many people make the mistake of creating a will early on in their life and then never touch the document again.  An estate plan is not a rigid structure.  Rather it should change with your life and remain as current as possible up until your death.",

    "content": "<p> A couple weeks ago, when I spoke at the ASJA conference in NYC (American Society of Journalists and Authors), an attendee asked if I could provide a quick checklist to streamline both speechwriting and public speaking. I can, and here it is:</p><p> <strong>  1. Focus the content. </strong> You can&rsquo;t put everything in a single presentation.</p><p> <strong>  2. Analyze the audience. </strong> Don&rsquo;t write one word or prepare one PowerPoint slide until you understand your audience.</p><p> <strong>  3. Research the topic with this specific audience in mind. </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. Organize your material so it&rsquo;s easy to follow. </strong></p><p> <strong>  5. Write everything so it&rsquo;s easy to understand. </strong> Rewrite. Cut. Then rewrite and cut again. Whether you&rsquo;re word-smithing a full manuscript speech, or writing simple bullet notes, or crafting a PowerPoint presentation, make your language easy for the audience to understand.</p><p> <strong>  6. Give your speech some style. </strong> Try anecdotes, examples, startling statistics, quotations, stories. Use rhetorical questions to engage the group.</p><p> <strong>  7. Consider using a light touch of humor. </strong> [The key word is \"light\". Go for smiles, not guffaws.]</p><p> <strong>  8. Allow enough time for rehearsals. </strong></p><p> <strong>  9. Consider the options for media attention. </strong> Include Tweet-worthy lines. Get photos for better social media interest.</p><p> If you follow this 9-step process, you&rsquo;ll have a speech that interests the audience, serves your organization, and builds your own career.</p><p> Good luck!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Happiness is such an interesting topic, mainly because we all have our own ideas and opinions about what being happy means and how one can be happy. In most cases, people talk about attaining happiness based on their own experiences. In that case, it could be hard to point out what particular methods one can use to be happy.</p><p> In this post, I&rsquo;m not going to talk about how I make myself happy. Instead, I will share some tips on how to be a happier, which are actually based on scientific facts. Here are some of them:</p><h3> Exercise More</h3><p> <br/> Exercise has a huge effect not only on our well-being, but on our happiness as well. As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s been scientifically proven that regular exercise is an excellent method to fight depression. Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to suffer from depression to get the benefits of exercise. What you should understand is that exercise can help your body relax, enhance your brain power, and even improve your self-image. Remember also that you need not go to the gym to exercise. A 10 minute workout at home will do as long as you do it consistently.</p><h3> Get Enough Sleep</h3><p> <br/> It is known to everyone how sleep enables the body to recover from everything it goes through during the day. By having quality sleep, you can also focus much better and become more productive. And as studies show, sleep also influences our levels of happiness. This is because the quality of your sleep, or lack of it, can affect how you feel when you wake up, and this can determine how good or bad you will feel the entire day.</p><h3> Live Closer to Work</h3><p> <br/> Surprisingly, your commute to the office can have a huge impact on your happiness. If you come to think of it, you commute to work two times a day and five days a week. With that said, how it makes you feel can affect your mood the entire day. So if you want to come to work feeling good and not stressed out, choose a home that will require a shorter commute to your work.</p><h3> Spend More Time with Friends and Family</h3><p> <br/> Not being able to spend quality time with friends and family is a common regret of the dying. This is because you just can&rsquo;t turn back the hands of time and find ways to just be with your loved ones. Social time is proven to be a highly essential factor in improving one&rsquo;s happiness. Thus, if you want to unwind, relax and feel better about your day, meet with a friend or a family.</p><h3> Find a Way to Help Others</h3><p> <br/> One of the most interesting pieces of advice about how to make yourself happier is to lend a helping hand to others. According to experts, dedicating some time to help other people can significantly enrich one&rsquo;s life. The reason for this is that once you help another person, you can instantly see the result, which could be in the form of a smile or a simple &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo; This gives you a sense of fulfillment knowing that you&rsquo;ve made another person happy.</p><h3> Why Is It Important to Be Happy?</h3><p> <br/> We all do things for a reason, and you have to try to be happier so that you can have a more meaningful existence. A <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/individuals/life-coaching/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   life coaching expert  </a> </u> would always say that life is too short to worry about many things. Time flies too fast for you to let it pass by without doing something good for others and yourself. </p>",
