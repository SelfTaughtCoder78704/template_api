One advisor asked out loud (quite cynically, I might add) what you&rsquo;re all probably thinking &ndash; &ldquo;Is it working?&rdquo;</p><p> He cited a wholesaler who came into his office with a printout of each of that advisor&rsquo;s LinkedIn connections requesting to be introduced to his personal key contacts and asked the rest of the advisors in the audience if they&rsquo;re doing the same thing.</p><p> Let me be clear; I&rsquo;m not advocating that you do this. Frankly, it&rsquo;s tacky and it sounds like a rookie LinkedIn marketing technique to me. It puts your client (and potential referral source) in a defensive posture.. On the other hand, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m advocating just having a LinkedIn profile and assume that it alone will automatically generate leads for you.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a fine line in what&rsquo;s appropriate, and what&rsquo;s not appropriate, on LinkedIn.</p><p> My &ldquo;social&rdquo; friend  <u>  Todd Greider </u>  (a non-profit leader, training specialist for a Fortune 500 company, and regulated industry veteran) agrees, and here&rsquo;s why. Regardless of what you&rsquo;re selling, you have to build a relationship &ndash; both online and offline. Todd and I are a good example of that. We started interacting online, each sharing interesting, relevant content and after realizing that we both hail from Pennsylvania, we&rsquo;ve now had multiple calls and are collaborating on today&rsquo;s blog post. He didn&rsquo;t come to me and say, &ldquo;I see you also work with financial advisors; can you please introduce me to your connections?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Status: In a relationship </strong> <br/> To succeed online, you must change from a transactional mindset &ldquo;I want to sell you something&rdquo; to the (sincere, not tacky) relationship mindset &ldquo;How may I help you and your network achieve your goals?&rdquo;</p><p> Rather than asking if you could meet a person&rsquo;s LinkedIn connections, change your message. Instead of saying, &ldquo;Do you know anyone who may benefit from the products or services that I offer?&rdquo; try &ldquo;Do you know anyone who may benefit from building a relationship like we have?&rdquo;</p><p> Some of you might be thinking &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that saying the same thing? Well, that depends on you, actually. According to Todd, if all you&rsquo;ve done is correspond a few times and sell them something, is that really a relationship? The reality is that the answer is probably not.</p><p> Trust in advisors continues to be challenged with every negative action by a small segment of financial advisors with bad intentions published in the media. That means advisors must work twice as hard to build relationships and establish trust from their clients and prospects.</p><p> When little is done to establish a relationship, it is hard for any advisor to justify asking for a referral via LinkedIn (or anywhere else). However, if you have:</p><li> Implemented a true holistic planning model</li><li> Exceeded the expectations of your clients (and I&rsquo;m not talking about their returns in the retirement plan) with every interaction they have with your firm</li><li> Shown substantial value that perhaps they can&rsquo;t get from another advisor <br/> then that&rsquo;s a different story &ndash; and one that could position an advisor better to garner LinkedIn introductions and offline referrals. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  All in the family </strong> <br/> Todd says some advisors he has worked with treat their clients like family, inviting them to personal gatherings and participating with their clients in community charity or outreach events, among other relationship-building activities. In those situations, those advisors saw clients proactively reaching out to their friends, family and peers to invite the advisor to speak at their company or nonprofit board and other gatherings, or join them at golf outings with friends. This is a true sign of trust and respect and a proactive way to truly make a value-added and sincere connection with your clients. Let&rsquo;s be clear, your clients know that you have a need to grow your business and at some point you may ask them to introduce you to their network. However, they are never going to do that if they don&rsquo;t honestly believe that they can trust you.</p><p> So if you&rsquo;ve implemented a true relationship model and provided holistic planning advice, how do you bridge that relationship from offline to online?</p><p> <strong>  A communications tool </strong> <br/> Here are some pointers when introducing LinkedIn as a communications tool to both new and existing clients.</p><p> <strong>  1. New client relationships. </strong></p><li> When you onboard a new client, include LinkedIn as a communications method up front. That way, it will be natural when you bring up LinkedIn as a means for networking down the road.</li><li> Explain why you use LinkedIn &ndash; and advocate that they use it, as well. It&rsquo;s important to have your message down pat. LinkedIn is more than just finding a new job or referrals. Tell clients that you use LinkedIn to stay on top of industry trends, what&rsquo;s happening in the markets, and expand your network. In essence, tell them, &ldquo;I use LinkedIn and here&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</li><li> Offer to help your clients use LinkedIn better. Many people would like to use LinkedIn more effectively. This in particular may help disarm anyone who may be protective of his or her network. Also, offer to be a good source of networking to them, if your network could be of use to your clients. Focus on making the online part of your relationship mutually beneficial. If they are business owners, do you know anyone who may help them achieve their personal or professional goals?</li><li> Ongoing, you can ask to get introduced to someone &ndash; either online or offline. If it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to ask about knowing a LinkedIn prospect in a client meeting, set the stage that you use LinkedIn in the meeting and then do the referral requests via the &ldquo;Get Introduced&rdquo; feature. Perhaps start with getting introductions to other COIs vs. going direct;y to a particular contact in their network. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Existing relationships. </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s easier to introduce LinkedIn with new client relationships and build it into your new client communication and onboarding process. But how do you build LinkedIn prospecting into your ongoing client process?</p><li> During client reviews, ask if anything has changed in their life. &ldquo;Are you using anything new for me to stay in contact with you?&rdquo; Offer a broad selection of communication tools &ndash; such as a quick text message, emails, and social media &ndash; as part of your communications plan. Reassess how they want to receive information from you each year, as their preferences may change.</li><li> You can then position that you&rsquo;re using LinkedIn more and invite the person to connect, if you haven&rsquo;t done so already.</li><li> If your client knows that you have a niche, you can let your connection know that you&rsquo;re looking to meet other people in the field, or even share a new case study with that group.</li><li> Let clients know that you&rsquo;re having an event that might be of interest to their connections vs. just setting up a lunch.</li><li> You might also want to start with other COIs with this group vs. their personal connections. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Authenticity is key </strong> <br/> In summary, be thoughtful and share valuable content. Whatever you do, be authentic, and don&rsquo;t sound like a stalker.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-03 18:42:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-03 18:42:16.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/referrals-via-linkedin-go-from-its-complicated-to-in-a-relationship/\", \"post_id\": \"7814\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-03 18:42:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-03 18:42:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"referrals-via-linkedin-go-from-its-complicated-to-in-a-relationship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7813\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3639\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Referrals-Via-LinkedIn.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"819\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449265500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The concept is to not only fill your pipeline with prospects but also fill it with new ideas to see which take hold best.</p><p> But on occasion, there is that middle stage whereby some of the noodles lose their stickiness and begin to fall to the floor. In realistic terms, we lose our enthusiasm for repeatedly doing the same. This may apply to career or entrepreneurial endeavors.</p><p> Motivation, commitment and perseverance feed into one another and together propel success.</p><h3> Boredom vs. Action <br/>  </h3><p> Upon reaching the point of almost boredom or questioning why you are spending your time on something providing minimal results, it becomes time to change. Otherwise, remaining stuck decreases self-confidence and eventually may lead you to quit.  The idea of change can provoke fear and a tough challenge. But once the shock of the need to change fades away, you are then positioned to take action.</p><p> As an employee, you might consider future employment that compelments your current field of knowledge. For example, if you are in sales offering products, you might give selling a related service a try.</p><h3> Personal Story <br/>  </h3><p> My own example is that once upon a time, I sold copiers. The next year, I gave selling print services a try.   It wasn&rsquo;t to my liking but provided me with incredible insight on how to improve sales of copiers. My next job with a copier firm proved to be one of the best job I ever held. Later on, I moved to the high tech industry.</p><p> As you move from one to the next, you do so with great insight due to the additional knowledge under your belt.</p><h3> Entrepreneurial Questions <br/>  </h3><p> On the entrepreneurial side, review all of the projects to which you have committed this past year. Ask yourself the following questions:</p><li> Which do I enjoy most?</li><li> Which are too time-consuming to be enjoyable?</li><li> Which do not provide a good ROI? <br/>  </li><p> Needless to say, you want to keep the projects in place that you enjoy the most and contribute to the bottom line. But of other two categoriies, which projects are to be substituted?</p><p> Give these questions due thought. As a new plan comes to light, your motivation will increase to embrace it. Upon conveying the new strategy to the people you meet, they will hear and see your enthusiasm. In turn, this will strengthen the relationships and help reach a new and broader audience.</p><p> Moving from the same old to something new will strengthen your personal brand and lead you to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smooth Sale!  </a> </u></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-03 18:47:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-03 18:47:00.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/move-from-same-old-to-something-new/\", \"post_id\": \"7816\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-03 18:47:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-03 18:47:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"move-from-same-old-to-something-new\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7815\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3640\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Move-From-Some-Old-to-something-New.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"589\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449248400,"author_id":161,"chart_url":""}

Please enjoy your weekend and don&rsquo;t even think of starting this until Monday. I just wanted to put this on your radar so you can take care of it when you get into work. Hope you&rsquo;re having a great weekend. Oh, and when you have a chance, can you also send me that document? OK, that&rsquo;s it, have a great Saturday. And please remember to call so-and-so on Monday. Peace out. (and let me know if I left anything out on the list that you can think of)</p><p> &mdash;&ndash;</p><p> <strong>  Dear Boss, </strong></p><p> Thank you for the company phone you gave me. I appreciate that it&rsquo;s much lighter on my leg than the ankle bracelets paroled felons wear. You caught me at brunch with my friends. I was listening to a friend tell this really funny story, the punch line of which I missed because I turned to look at the bright email alert from you. I know all the parts of the story except the main reason it was being told. Afterwards we&rsquo;re going to a movie where the list of stuff you sent me will be superimposed on my retina as I watch the moving images on the screen. But don&rsquo;t worry, the fear of losing my job is the cushion on which I lay my head at night, so you&rsquo;ll find that list of stuff done by the time I walk into the office Monday morning.</p><p> &mdash;&ndash;</p><p> <strong>  Why Your Torture Plan Will Surely Backfire </strong></p><p> You know when someone stands way too close to you while talking? This has the same effect. It&rsquo;s an intrusion of space and leaves no room to breathe. Employees will always feel like they have to respond to their boss&rsquo; emails, no matter when they receive them, to give the impression that they are always on. Motivation, creativity, and drive are all depleting aspects of human behavior. When people feel like they always have to be on it only creates poor productivity results. Brains need time to rest and repair. Not allowing for brain repair through off time will only backfire.</p><p> &mdash;&ndash;</p><p> <strong>  Maybe Try This Instead? </strong></p><p> If you have a need to plough through your to-do list on weekends, by all means do so. But send those emails out Monday morning. If something is urgent and requires immediate attention develop a system with your people that communicates urgency (whether it be a phone call, a subject line that says 911, or an emoticon of a fire truck). But always remember&hellip;YOU&rsquo;RE THE BOSS! People WILL respond or at least feel pressured to do so.

{"original_id":3525,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Plan A Badass Company Holiday Party","link":"how-to-plan-a-badass-company-holiday-party","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a company on a mission to spread employee happiness, we practice what we preach. And one of our favorite ways to drive employee engagement, recognition, and celebration of our culture is by throwing a company holiday party.</p><p> But we've all been to parties where employees stand around awkwardly because they don't want to be there. Or ones where only the top executives get to share the company's glory. Those gatherings are more like mandatory meetings rather than celebrations.</p><p> So here are a few tips I've picked up from both attending and planning our own unforgettable TINYparties.</p><h3> 1. Start early <br/>  </h3><p> Party planning takes a lot of time and commitment. So start as soon as possible. For our summer party, we gave ourselves only one month, and it was a scramble to get everything together. This time around, we've given ourselves three months to take the pressure off of last-minute reservations, orders, etc.</p><h3> 2. Establish a party-planning committee</h3><p> <br/> Matt and Amanda are on the other side of the camera. I swear I didn't forget about them!</p><p> Don't let the burden fall on the shoulders of the office manager. But also don't just leave everything up in the air and hope people will volunteer to pick up the planning.</p><p> Instead, create a party-planning committee. Have one person from each department join. It'll foster cross-departmental collaboration and ensure each team is represented.</p><h3> 2. Give the Party a Title <br/>  </h3><p> During the summer, we had TINYluau. This holiday, we're going for The TINYs. By giving each party a distinct name, it helps people remember exactly when it was and what all went down.</p><p> Don't forget to give it a fun theme too. Consider a juxtaposed one like formalwear and wigs!</p><h3> 3. Nail the date ASAP</h3><p> <br/> This is the biggest hurdle that we struggle with. Since we want the highest attendance possible, the party committee chooses four potential dates for the event. Those dates are then sent out on a Google form so everyone in the company can select which ones are possible for them.</p><p> Pester people and get them to respond. Many times we've sent out the form and people just ignore it.</p><h3> 4. Use both online and physical invitations <br/>  </h3><p> Getting people to RSVP isn't as easy as you may think. Just check out what my fellow party planner, Matt Terasaki, has to say:</p><p> \"Getting your coworkers to RSVP is a lot like being a dentist. You know you&rsquo;re pulling teeth and filling cavities for your patient&rsquo;s own good, but they avoid committing to a time as long as they possibly can. The key is to make responding more fun. Create an eye-catching event website like  <u>  <a href=\"https://splashthat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Splash  </a> </u>  where they can read up on the event, see pictures from last year, and RSVP directly on the site. Make sure to use language that makes it feel mandatory, not optional, and provide a deadline to RSVP by. Post the invitation/announcement in the place that you know everyone will see it. This could be in the break room, restroom, online internal chatroom, email, etc.</p><p> \"It&rsquo;s important to account for those who are hired after the initial announcement as well. One of the best ways to make sure they are aware of the party and RSVP promptly is to have their direct supervisors include it into their onboarding. New hires always want to make a good impression by being on top of things, so chances are they will RSVP as soon as they&rsquo;re prompted to do so.\"</p><h3> 5. Use a spreadsheet to keep track of budget <br/>  </h3><p> Whether your budget is $10,000 or $500, money runs out quick. Use a shared spreadsheet to keep track of expenses &mdash; from food to table rentals.</p><h3> 6. Order enough food <br/>  </h3><p> Guests are going to arrive hungry, and they're going to expect to stuff themselves. To make sure everyone is fed, order 30% more food. If you have 40 people attending, order enough food for 52 people.</p><h3> 7. Serve signature cocktails <br/>  </h3><p> Immerse your guests in the party's theme by serving up signature cocktails. Is that a vodka cran you're drinking? Nope, it's a Red Carpet. </p><h3> 8. Decorate to impress</h3><p> <br/> There's a reason why we always hold parties in our office &mdash; we get total control. But no one wants to step into the office and feel like they should start working.</p><p> Hide office furniture in conference rooms, hang up streamers, go all out. Make people forget they're actually at the office.</p><h3> 9. Choose only one or two types of featured entertainment</h3><p> <br/> It's tempting to have a photobooth, karaoke, baby tiger, and magician all at one party. But the goal is to get employees to bond. They can't do that when they're off doing things on their own.</p><p> Instead, just have one featured entertainment like karaoke. It'll encourage employees to gather in one central area and have fun together.</p><h3> 10. Create some friendly competition <br/>  </h3><p> Prior to the party, have employees team up and register for the tournament. Depending on what your office is equipped with, you can either create a poster with the brackets or use an online tool like  <a href=\"http://challonge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Challonge </a>  to cast it onto a TV screen.</p><p> Of course, winners should get rewarded and losers punished ...</p><h3> 11. Have an award ceremony <br/>  </h3><p> Have employees nominate their coworkers for prespecified awards (rookie of the year, MVP, etc). Make it a fun process by creating videos for each nomination.

I guarantee you that.&rdquo; &mdash;Michelle Obama</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s that dreaded time of year. If you&rsquo;re in management, you struggle with how to rank your employees. What areas can you give them good marks for? What area can you tell them they need to improve in (because you can&rsquo;t let them think they&rsquo;re good in every area)? So much time is spent preparing the review for your employees, and then more time to dreadfully sit down and go over the review with them.</p><p> If you are an employee you dread the waste of time, the uncomfortable energy, the feeling of being placed under a hot interrogation light. And, to what end? Just to walk out of your manager&rsquo;s office having no better understanding of your value, expectations, or performance than before you walked in.</p><p> As Michelle Obama expressed in the quote at the beginning of this article, using standardize methods for determining performance can often leave talent overlooked and contributions undervalued. So, how can you make sure that employee reviews individualized and are not a waste of time for you or for them?</p><h3> Conversations are vital <br/>  </h3><p> Relationships are the key to any successful venture that requires the cooperation of more than one party. And, your organization falls into this category. You need the cooperative efforts of every individual in order to achieve your goals. So, how are these relationships developed? Establishing an atmosphere where conversations can take place, not just once a year, but on a daily basis is vital. Sitting face-to-face with your employees at the ritualistic employee review is a great place to lay the foundation for informal, unscripted, trusting conversations throughout the year. Use this time to express, and demonstrate that each employee has a voice in your organization. Show genuine interest in their perspectives and ideas. And, prove that you are willing to communicate openly with them.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s about the future <br/>  </h3><p> Use employee reviews as an opportunity to focus on the future, not the past. The past has been carved in stone, no changing it now. So, let&rsquo;s focus on the upcoming year. What can the employee do to make it a great year? What do they need from you in order to be successful? This is not a competition; every employee should be tasked only with improving themselves based on where they are now, and where they want to be in the future.</p><h3> Something meaningful <br/>  </h3><p> You need to inspire employees to give their best in the coming year. There is no better way to inspire someone than to give them something meaningful to work towards. Why is what the organization does important? What inspires you to come to work every day? Your answer to these questions must not be the superficial, financial bottom line. This will never provide incentive that is meaningful to your employees. Financial bottom lines as a &lsquo;why&rsquo; will get employees to perform out of fear. Employees perform for successful leaders because they are passionate and inspired. How does each employee specifically contribute to the big picture? Help them to find something meaningful in their work.</p><h3> Removing obstacles</h3><p> <br/> This is more about you than them. What obstacles do they feel are standing in their way? Sometimes the obstacle may even be you. It can be a difficult conversation for a leader to genuinely listen to employees share their perspective on the obstacles they encounter in the workplace. But, you must listen, ask questions, and make sure you get a clear picture of their concerns. As the leader, it is your responsibility to eliminate obstacles where possible.</p><h3> Value their contribution <br/>  </h3><p> And last, but definitely not least, make sure every employee feels valued. We don&rsquo;t employ people we don&rsquo;t need. So, if they are there, the task they perform must be important; just as important as any other task, including yours. Therefore, their contribution is of great value, and they need to know that you recognize them as individuals for their contribution to the overall success of the organization.</p><p> Stop treating employee reviews like a standardized test in school. These are individuals, the individuals that spend a big part of their waking hours in the service of your organization. If the employee review process is not valuable to them, it&rsquo;s not valuable to the organization and it is a waste of time and money. Make employee reviews beneficial. Focus on developing a comfortable atmosphere for daily conversations. Keep it about building a great future not concentrating on the past. Share what inspires you and give them something meaningful to believe in and work towards. Recognize that it is your responsibility to remove the obstacles that employees feel they are encountering, even if you disagree. And, leave no doubt about the value of their individual contributions.</p><p> <strong>  Stop wasting time! </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-03 19:07:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-03 19:07:48.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/make-sure-your-employee-reviews-arent-a-waste-of-time/\", \"post_id\": \"7822\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-03 19:07:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-03 19:07:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"make-sure-your-employee-reviews-arent-a-waste-of-time\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7821\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3643\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Employee-Reviews.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"596\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449255600,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

Something to fire you back up and fuel some new ideas. Or maybe you&rsquo;re looking to improve your current product offering by adding more features, creating a more robust platform, or changing the entire product altogether. Whatever it is that you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration in, there are several places you should always start. Inc. Magazine (@Inc)  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324445904578283792526004684\" target=\"_blank\">   gives some practical advice  </a> </u>  for businesses to get inspiration. Here, we list some of our favorites: </p><h3> Listen to People You Know <br/>  </h3><p> Get customer feedback: Listen to customers and create products and services that give them more of what they like and/or remove what they dislike.</p><p> Listen to front-line employees: The workers who manufacture the widgets, interact with customers and so on see what takes too long to accomplish, what is too expensive, what causes problems. Talk to those workers, or even do those jobs yourself.</p><h3> Look at What&rsquo;s Bugging You</h3><p> <br/> Ideas for startups often begin with a problem that needs to be solved. And they don&rsquo;t usually come while you&rsquo;re sitting around sipping coffee and contemplating life. They tend to reveal themselves while you&rsquo;re hard at work on something else.</p><h3> Be Present in Life <br/>  </h3><p> Start your brainstorming with problems that you are personally invested in. Building a business is hard as hell and takes the kind of relentless dedication that comes from personal passion.</p><p> Also, most businesspeople tend to ignore our creative side until we really need it. Making sure that your life has a balance of the arts is a great way to stay engaged creatively.</p><h3> Attack Practical Problems <br/>  </h3><p> Make a note whenever you encounter a service or a customer experience that frustrates you, or wish you had a product that met your needs that you can&rsquo;t find anywhere. Then ask yourself, is this a problem I could solve? And how much time and money would it take to test my idea?</p><h3> Head into Weird Places <br/>  </h3><p> For entrepreneurs to stretch their brains, they should seek out the unusual. For instance, Talk to weird people. Striking up conversations with people who are different from you can be powerful.</p><p> Walk in weird places. Take walks in hidden suburban neighborhoods, department stores, community colleges. When you&rsquo;re walking with no purpose but walking, you see things in fresh ways, because you have the luxury of being in the present.</p><h3> Be Prepared to Shift Gears <br/>  </h3><p> Entrepreneurs need to understand two things. For one thing, their first (or second or third) idea is often not the real opportunity. In fact, it might stink. They have to be on the lookout for why it stinks and be willing to shift course. But they also need to understand that even if their idea has problems, there&rsquo;s often a good opportunity buried within it. They need to talk to people and continue tweaking and transforming it. In the process, they encounter setbacks, rethink their approach, try again and redefine what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-03 19:13:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-03 19:13:19.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/where-to-get-inspiration-for-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"7824\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-03 19:13:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-03 19:13:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"where-to-get-inspiration-for-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7823\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3644\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Where-to-Get-Inspiration-for-Your-Business.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"348\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449252900,"author_id":438,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3528,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Practical Tool I Used To Cultivate Self-Compassion","link":"the-practical-tool-i-used-to-cultivate-self-compassion","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Truth be told, I&rsquo;ve known I need to write about self-compassion for some time. Not just for my readers, but for myself. The reason I put it off? I suck at it. And I wasn&rsquo;t quite ready to give up the part of me that believed that being gentle with myself would lead to stagnation. My high expectations of myself and others have propelled me forward, yet they&rsquo;ve also been what kept me stuck. So now, as the Holidays begin and I sort through the proverbial piles of projects I&rsquo;ve taken on, I&rsquo;ve decided to say &ldquo;fuck it!&rdquo; and learn this lesson once and for all. After all, as Pema Chodron notes, &ldquo;nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know.&rdquo;</p><h3> So, Let's Start By Defining \"Self-Compassion:\" <br/>  </h3><p> Simply put, it&rsquo;s being gentle on yourself. It&rsquo;s treating yourself as you would a friend when she comes to you with a struggle, failure, or self-critical belief. It&rsquo;s the ability to lean into your feelings of discomfort rather than ignoring them. This means no longer asking for permission to feel your emotions. Instead, it&rsquo;s learning to self-validate, stating &ldquo;this is a difficult time for me and it&rsquo;s okay that I&rsquo;m struggling. What can I do to give myself the comfort I need and deserve?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Self-compassion is not the same as complacency. </strong></p><p> You can still work to achieve your goals, but it&rsquo;s done through self-love instead of self-discipline. It&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;I need to do this or else I&rsquo;m worthless,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want to do this because I care about myself, my potential, and my dreams.&rdquo;</p><p> To approve of oneself is to know divine love.</p><p> Self-compassion means honoring that you&rsquo;re not perfect in the same way you (sometimes begrudgingly) accept imperfection in others. More than anything, self-compassion comes from understanding that mistakes, transition, and unmet expectations are all part of being human. These experiences and feelings are not unique to you. The more you fight this truth and aim to be perfect, the harder it will be to cultivate compassion for yourself and others.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re anything like me, this is easier said than done.</p><h3> So How Did I Actually Do This? <br/>  </h3><p> For me, the biggest challenge was the critical voice in my head that said things like &ldquo;other people can do this, why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; And sure, I could  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/living-authentically\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tap into more loving parts of myself  </a> </u>  and reason with that voice, but it didn&rsquo;t come easily. It took A TON of work. And since the Buddhist approach of &ldquo;releasing judgment&rdquo; was a bit too much of a stretch in times of stress, I tried a different path.</p><p> One of the daily exercises I assign my clients is to practice self-validation in a structured way. I ask them to write &ldquo;one thing they did well&rdquo; in a daily chart. It can be anything from &ldquo;I got out of bed when I didn&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; to &ldquo;I made a healthy choice for lunch&rdquo; to &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t flip out on my mother when she asked me about my relationship status.&rdquo;</p><p> However, in times of stress and overwhelm, doing this in one area wasn&rsquo;t enough. I needed a holistic self-validation overhaul. To do this, I made a daily chart and touched on each of the 5 pillars. Each day I recorded one thing I did well in each area of my life: Nutrition, Physical Activity, Relationships, Career, and Personal Philosophy. For those who are new to this or find this to be too open-ended, here are some</p><h3> Questions to Help Guide You: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Nutrition: </strong></p><li> What&rsquo;s one healthy food choice I made for my body?</li><li> How did it feel to nourish myself lovingly or allow myself to indulge? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Physical Activity: </strong></p><li> What&rsquo;s one way I was kind to my body?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one thing I appreciate about my body? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Relationships: </strong></p><li> What&rsquo;s one thing I did for another person?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one thing I appreciate about another person in my life?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one way I reached out and connected with someone? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Career: </strong></p><li> What&rsquo;s one thing I accomplished today?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one step (even if it&rsquo;s a baby step) I took toward achieving my goal?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one thing I learned today?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one moment where I felt grateful for sharing my gifts with others? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Personal Philosophy: </strong></p><li> What&rsquo;s one thing I marveled at?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one thing I love about myself?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one way I tuned into my higher self?</li><li> What&rsquo;s one way I appreciated nature? <br/>  </li><h3> The Takeaway: <br/>  </h3><p> If you can&rsquo;t seem to accept that you&rsquo;re a human instead of a superhero, treat yourself as you would a friend by building your self-validation muscle.</p><p> P.S. I know the holiday time can be stressful so I'm opening up a handful of mini-intensive coaching sessions. This 2-3 session series will get you through the holidays and into the New Year with a sense of calm, surrender, and direction.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-03 19:20:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-03 19:20:51.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-practical-tool-i-used-to-cultivate-self-compassion/\", \"post_id\": \"7826\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-03 19:20:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-03 19:20:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-practical-tool-i-used-to-cultivate-self-compassion\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7825\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3645\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cultivate-Self-Compassion.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"613\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449241200,"author_id":22,"chart_url":""}

With each generation sharing valuable strengths and talents, there is no doubt that teams can produce extraordinary outcomes.  <strong>  So why are so many organizations facing generational friction? </strong></p><p> There are some leaders who would argue that generational differences don&rsquo;t really exist. They believe that tension on teams is less about generational dissimilarities and more about personality clashes. From working with leaders and teams, it has become clear that a generational divide often derails the best-intentioned strategies. In fact, when organizations admit that a generational gap may be driving a team&rsquo;s dysfunction and are willing to address the challenge, eyes are opened and connections begin.</p><p> <strong>  Here are five ways to bridge the four generations: </strong></p><h3>  1. Learn what events shaped each generation <br/>  </h3><p> To really see why each generation has certain behaviors and attitudes it is critical to identify the events that impacted them. For example: the Traditionalists were shaped by the Great Depression and as a result have a conservative and frugal view of money; the Baby Boomers were influenced by the Civil Rights movement and continue to question authority; Generation X was impacted by Downsizing and saw their parents laid-off so may see organizations are less loyal; the Millennials were influenced by school shootings and technology advances, bringing security issues into their teams.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Each+generation+is+shaped+by+the+events+of+their+time.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/11/30/leading-different-generations-on-your-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Each generation is shaped by the events of their time.  </u> </a></p><h3> 2. Understand the different perspectives on work <br/>  </h3><p> Each generation views work a little differently, which may cause friction. While Traditionalists work to live, Baby Boomers live to work. Gen X created the work/life balance and the Millennials see work and life and one big continuum. These opposing work ethics can cause some team members to think certain individuals aren&rsquo;t putting in enough hours at the office, while some generations focus on achieving the end result, not hours worked.</p><h3> 3.

{"original_id":3530,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"On the Importance of Prioritizing and Defining a Desired Outcome","link":"on-the-importance-of-prioritizing-and-defining-a-desired-outcome","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Every day multiple things require our attention: projects that are due, recent developments in the office, last-minute changes, unexpected calls and emails from colleagues, bosses and clients, and the list goes on. A constant flood of information, requests, updates and demands doesn&rsquo;t stop and wait for us to catch a breath, regroup and brace ourselves for more to come; we get frequently interrupted, frustrated and more and more overwhelmed by new and important additions to our already full plates. This may sound like mayhem to some, but to others it is just another day at work. <br/>  </h3><p> So what do we do when there is so much that needs to be done? Trying to manage everything at once or as soon as it presents itself clearly doesn&rsquo;t work. In fact, this strategy only leads to more frustration, stress, mental and physical exhaustion, and eventually to the mere thought of going back to the office filling us with intense loathing for our jobs. In order to avoid such a disaster, it is important to stay organized and focused, and NOT try to do everything or please everyone. There is one fundamental truth that is essential to remember so that we continue to remain in control of our work life: Multitasking is not an option &ndash; it really doesn&rsquo;t work when everything we need to do is important to us.</p><p> The strategy that does work is prioritizing. Unlike multitasking, prioritizing allows us to use two of our most valuable resources &ndash; time and energy &ndash; in the most efficient way possible. In the long run, prioritizing will help us make better choices, focus only on the value-added tasks and activities, and get more work done with less effort. In other words, while multitasking can lower our productivity, prioritizing will allow us to be more productive and less stressed.</p><p> In many cases, employees are struggling with competing priorities. They might say they prioritize, but then the boss walks in and says, &ldquo;Here is a new priority&rdquo;! Most leaders don&rsquo;t realize the negative impact on employees of inconsistent or competing priorities: wasted resources, delays, errors and strained relationships with colleagues who may all be trying to succeed but measure success differently.</p><p> Having too many priorities is a popular problem in business. An article in the Harvard Business Review journal reports that in a survey of 1,800 global executives conducted by Strategy&amp; &ndash; a global team of practical strategists that is a part of the PwC network of firms &ndash; 64% of the surveyed executives  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/04/stop-chasing-too-many-prioriti\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   admitted struggling with too many conflicting priorities  </a> </u> .</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just the executives who struggle with competing priorities; we all have been in a situation where we had to deal with multiple competing priorities and conflicting responsibilities at least a couple of times in our professional and social lives. Working under several managers or on a number of concurrent projects is very common in a modern-day workplace, and it often requires us to cover multiple fronts simultaneously. Not doing well is not an option, but the funny thing is, the better we do our jobs the more responsibilities we get, and the list of our priorities continuously expands. Finally, there comes a time when we can&rsquo;t effectively manage all of these priorities any longer and must say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to some of them. But which priorities should we reject and which not? Although the choice can seem difficult, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. In order to make the right decisions we must answer one question for ourselves: What is our desired outcome?</p><p> In the S.H.I.F.T. model&trade;, defining a desired outcome is the very first step of the process and for a good reason: How can we reach our destination if we don&rsquo;t know where we are going? To identify our desired outcome, we must first define what success means to us &ndash; both quantitatively and qualitatively. One person&rsquo;s idea of success will be different from another&rsquo;s, as success includes multiple components and aspects that for each one of us are mixed in different proportions. We must be very clear on our personal idea of success &ndash; what do we want to achieve and, more importantly, why do we want to achieve it &ndash; because it will determine what opportunities we are going to pursue as a result. This step may take a bit of time and some figuring out, but in the end any amount of time or effort spent on it will be worthwhile, as knowing our desired outcome can help us focus our energy on the priorities that really matter and bring us one step closer to our goals.</p><p> Having defined our desired outcome, we can begin working backward from it on mapping out our road to success. Defining our desired outcome will allow us to identify which of the competing priorities we should say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to and what sacrifices we will need to make. Understanding what success means to us will also make saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; easier, since we will know exactly why we have to give up certain things and what we will be able to obtain in exchange for it. This step is the most important in the S.H.I.F.T. model, and done correctly, it will help us to avoid unnecessary stress and panic, manage our time better, invest ourselves into relationships and activities that are going to benefit us in the long run, and regain control of the progress toward our goals.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-03 19:34:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-03 19:34:46.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/on-the-importance-of-prioritizing-and-defining-a-desired-outcome/\", \"post_id\": \"7830\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-03 19:34:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-03 19:34:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"on-the-importance-of-prioritizing-and-defining-a-desired-outcome\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7829\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3647\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prioritizing-and-Defining-a-Desired-Outcome.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"653\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449252000,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

This is a simple DIY wreath that anyone can make at home. We used a 12&Prime; foam wreath which we wrapped in white ribbon to start. Using our downloadable templates, we then cut leaves in three different shapes out of various shades of wool felt. Next, we added a running stitch to the holly leaf in a white embroidery floss to add a little extra detail. We pinched the stems of half of the holly leaves and secured them at the bottom with glue to give depth and dimension to the top layer of our wreath (you don&rsquo;t need to do this with the bottom layers of leaves!). The easiest way to secure the felt leaves to the wreath is using a low temperature glue gun but you could also use fabric glue. Finally, we added little white felted balls as berries to complete the winter wonderland look.

{"original_id":3532,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Changing Rules of Grammar","link":"the-changing-rules-of-grammar","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Since the dawn of time &ndash; or at least since the first cavemen started chiselling on stone tablets &ndash; people have debated what constitutes proper use of language. Fact is, grammar is fluid and as times and trends change, writers adapt the rules &ndash; for better or worse. Here are five examples of grammar faux pas that are now generally accepted.</p><h3> 1. Using certain nouns as adjectives</h3><p> <br/> As an example, it used to be that &ldquo;American&rdquo; was the adjective and &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo; (or &ldquo;America&rdquo;) was the noun. However, it&rsquo;s now accepted to say something like &ldquo;The U.S. financial system is gaining stability.&rdquo;</p><p> More recently, many people are using &ldquo;woman&rdquo; as an adjective &ndash; e.g., &ldquo;This firm has a high percentage of woman portfolio managers.&rdquo; Of course, &ldquo;female&rdquo; is the correct adjective. Even worse, some writers use &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;female&rdquo; interchangeably as adjectives in the same piece, without rhyme or reason. Double whammy.</p><h3> 2. Splitting infinitives</h3><p> <br/> Teachers used to implore their students never to split infinitives. Then the TV show Star Trektalked of the mission &ldquo;to boldly go where no man has gone before,&rdquo; and the split infinitive lost its stigma. Other languages like French and Italian keep their infinitives as one word, so no worries about splitting those.</p><h3> 3. Ending a sentence with a preposition</h3><p> <br/> Purists may cringe when people finish sentences with a preposition, but most anyone else won&rsquo;t even blink at a sentence such as &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big hole to climb out of.&rdquo; Sometimes it&rsquo;s just more pleasing to the ear than to say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big hole out of which to climb.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Using the plural &ldquo;their&rdquo; in relation to singular nouns</h3><p> <br/> Practicality was the impetus behind this morphing grammar rule, as it&rsquo;s cumbersome to write &ndash; and worse to read &ndash; a sentence like &ldquo;When an individual squanders his or her money, he or she will find that tough times will soon beset him or her.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5. Using certain adjectives, instead of nouns, in a compound adjective</h3><p> <br/> This one&rsquo;s hard to explain but examples should help. While it&rsquo;s grammatically correct to say &ldquo;Canadian company&rdquo; or &ldquo;German scientist,&rdquo; introducing a second preceding adjective changes the rules.</p><p> Although common, saying &ldquo;a Canadian-based company&rdquo; or &ldquo;a German-born scientist&rdquo; is wrong. The company is not &ldquo;based in Canadian&rdquo; and the scientist was not &ldquo;born in German.&rdquo; Correct usage is &ldquo;Canada-based company&rdquo; and &ldquo;Germany-born scientist.&rdquo; Not sure why people tend to do this with countries but not cities. For instance, you&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;Toronto-based writer&rdquo; but never &ldquo;Torontonian-based writer.&rdquo;</p><p> Language can be so much fun!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-03 19:47:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-03 19:47:55.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-changing-rules-of-grammar/\", \"post_id\": \"7834\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-03 19:47:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-03 19:47:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-changing-rules-of-grammar\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7833\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3649\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/good-grammer.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"684\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449237600,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3533,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"I Guarantee That If You Have a Properly Diversified Portfolio ...","link":"i-guarantee-that-if-you-have-a-properly-diversified-portfolio","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlooomInc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Chris Costello  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.blooom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blooom  </u> </a></p><h3> In the financial industry, most advisors are trained at a very early age to essentially remove the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; from their vocabulary.</h3><p> <br/> For obvious reasons, when investors are dealing with managing portfolios that have any exposure to the stock market, there is never such a thing as a guaranteed return. If you want guarantees, you generally look to a Certificates of Deposit (CD) with FDIC protection or US Treasury Bonds that are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the US Government (all jokes aside). So uttering the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; anywhere in the same vicinity as a discussion about stock market investments is totally off limits.</p><p> Well, I am going to run head-on into the forbidden term and come right out and guarantee you something. I GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU HAVE A PROPERLY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO THAT YOUR ACCOUNT WILL LOSE VALUE OCCASIONALLY.</p><p> That&rsquo;s right, I said it and I will say it again. I GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU HAVE A PROPERLY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO THAT YOUR ACCOUNT WILL LOSE VALUE OCCASIONALLY.</p><p> When you have a properly diversified portfolio, it means that a portion of your account will be invested in the stock market (likely both US and International markets). There has never been a period greater than a few months where a diversified portfolio didn&rsquo;t lose value. Markets never just go straight up. And while historically the decline in value is temporary, it does happen and will continue to happen. Over the years, I have often told our clients that it isn&rsquo;t IF your account will lose value it is WHEN and HOW MANY TIMES it will lose value over an investor&rsquo;s lifetime.</p><p> Now before you start to panic I want to digress and point out that there is a difference between losing value v. losing money. As stated above, your 401k will drop in value from time to time. But for you to actually lose money in your 401k takes an additional action on your part. It is only when you sell while the market is down that you are taking the temporary decline and making it a permanent loss. That is when you lose actual money in your 401k, not simply when the market declines. (For further explanation on the difference between losing value v. losing money read my blog,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.blooom.com/blog/dont-sell-dont-lose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   If You Don&rsquo;t Sell You Don&rsquo;t Lose  </a> </u> .)</p><p> And not only are market declines normal, I would argue that they are necessary. Yes, I said necessary. If markets never declined, then there would be virtually no risk, and in the absence of risk there is always an absence of attractive returns. We need the volatility and risk in the markets to create the above-average returns that have been generated over the long term versus riskless investments with no volatility. To put it another way, the reason that banks do not have to offer high yields on their CDs is because there isn&rsquo;t any risk to invest in a CD (assuming the bank has FDIC protection). There is no such safety-net in the stock market, which is a big reason why investors that have stayed invested in the market over a long period of time have been rewarded with handsome returns well in excess of CD rates. In short, without the risk there are no rewards.</p><h3> If you are reading this, there is a very good chance that you are an investor.</h3><p> <br/> You likely have a 401k and presumably blooom is managing it for you. If, for some reason, you became a blooom client under the false assumption that we would prevent your account from ever declining in value please do one of two things, either immediately change your expectations to account for future declines in value OR contact us immediately to cancel your investment advisory contract with blooom. Because blooom cannot change the normal course of the stock market.</p><p> After all of this, a question you might be left with is, what do I do when the market declines? Or maybe the better question should be, what shouldn&rsquo;t I do? As explained above, you should not sell. Selling will only convert the loss of value to loss of actual money. If you really want to take some action during these down times, then treat market declines like &ldquo;Black Friday Deals&rdquo; after Thanksgiving and BUY. Times when your account drops in value means that your investments have essentially just gone on sale and like all good sales, they don&rsquo;t last forever. The markets and your portfolio value will recover over time and those discounted prices will go away.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-04 19:20:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-04 19:20:36.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/i-guarantee-that-if-you-have-a-properly-diversified-portfolio/\", \"post_id\": \"7838\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-04 19:20:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-04 19:20:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"i-guarantee-that-if-you-have-a-properly-diversified-portfolio\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7837\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3652\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/investing-guarantee.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"398\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449519000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3534,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Your Company Cowardice is Leaving Money on the Table","link":"how-your-company-cowardice-is-leaving-money-on-the-table","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> This is the most information-rich, creatively prolific period in human history. There are more people online with more access points and they have big ideas &mdash; ideas that are changing the world.</h3><p> <br/> Marketers have to constantly reinvent the message with an ever-greater focus on authentic brand experiences because without that degree authenticity their brand is just another package on the shelf. That&rsquo;s why the most exciting marketers are blending creativity and technology in new ways to cultivate experiences that truly resonate with consumers.</p><p> Innovative marketing requires vision and an appetite for risk. Today&rsquo;s ace marketers aren&rsquo;t just shoving commercials into the cluttered breaks of popular TV events; they&rsquo;re taking full advantage of the possibilities in experiential marketing, digital media, and interactive experiences.  </p><p> Organizational fear drives a lack of discipline, and when marketers act fearfully they play it safe. Safe isn&rsquo;t scrutiny, it isn&rsquo;t diligence &mdash; it&rsquo;s a lack of imagination. It&rsquo;s the tendency to lather, rinse, and repeat, and it creates a lack of disciple through laziness.</p><h3> The Landscape of Fear</h3><p> <br/> CMOs and marketers have more tools to measure data, diminish risk, understand return, and create experiences than ever before. There&rsquo;s no room for the comfort of playing it safe in a successful marketing strategy. Marketers need to utilize the tools at their disposal, and still have the gall to be original.</p><p> When companies refuse to be original, however, they risk diminishing the innovation quotient. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the rush of an email that offers a discounted rate on a rental car when the customer does not plan to travel. It tells them that this is a disconnected company in a connected world. There is no insight into the information the consumer shares.</p><p> The marketer may know it&rsquo;s time to dust off the email machine, but without using existing platforms and a wide range of APIs, the moment of consideration is not effective or lucrative, but instead a swift click of &ldquo;delete.&rdquo;</p><p> Avoiding risk also wastes money. Marketing isn&rsquo;t cheap, so a company can&rsquo;t afford for any of its efforts to go unnoticed (as they so often do). These missteps breed frustration and cost money. The battle between marketing efforts and results boils down to tools. However, marketers don&rsquo;t need more tools &mdash; they need better tools to give them insights that drive results.</p><p> But how can a company avoid being fearful in order to see results?</p><h3> Leading by Example</h3><p> <br/> It starts at the top, and when organizations stop taking risks, complacency settles in. It&rsquo;s an exponential effect that hamstrings innovation and drags productivity down. Organizations slip into this trap by creating bottom-down processes where the employees must &ldquo;make sense&rdquo; of the half-thought ideas of leadership struggling to connect.</p><p> Rule number one of leadership: Leaders are out of touch. They are in countless meetings, live in airplanes and hotels, connect the dots, and sell the big idea.</p><p> The problem with is they&rsquo;re not close to the customer. They don&rsquo;t understand the needs as well as they used to or the pace of the market. Reading closes the gap a bit but doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem.</p><p> The trick is creating an organization focused on listening more than talking. Use &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; as the core motivator. It encourages a culture of making, trying, adapting, and exploring.</p><p> This more than anything will translate into great, authentic ideas and well-informed executives who can actively contribute to the formation of strategic marketing plans &mdash; not pepper (or pepper spray) their teams with immediate needs in a reactive posture.</p><h3> Producing Change</h3><p> <br/> Playing it safe isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;playing&rdquo; at all. It&rsquo;s repurposing tired ideas and emboldening a status quo that is fast becoming obsolete with the vast array of tools at everyone&rsquo;s disposal. Here are three solutions to help marketers stop being afraid and start generating results:</p><h3> Workshops:</h3><p> Workshops are meetings with clearly identified purpose and outcomes. They are inclusive and use experiential activities that gauge a wide variety of perceptions, goals, and tactics.</p><p> In short, everyone gets to share his or her point of view in an environment designed to listen. They are a break from the everyday and consistently invigorate the participants. Remember, the environment is as important as the content and structure &mdash; workshops should be conducive to collaboration and keep activities democratic.</p><h3> Tools:</h3><p> Find the right tools to create line of sight. CMOs must understand what their brand is doing in the dark, where it goes, and what it says. The message can become muddled quickly and become disorganized, inconsistent, and noisy faster than anyone thought.</p><p> Consider monitoring tools that silence the noise and deliver a clear view of how every channel behaves. Curating a data-driven approach to marketing requires coordination because 10 sophisticated tools out of sync results in one messy message.</p><h3> Experiments:</h3><p> Nothing replaces experimentation. It&rsquo;s the loudly beating heart of possibility and it&rsquo;s the greatest motivator supervisors can give their teams. Explore technology, experiential marketing, and new channels. Speak directly to the audience through <u>  <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Periscope  </a> </u> , open up monthly meetings to customers, blend office space into retail space, and have marketers working in the middle of it all.</p><p> Why should operations be out of view? Unless the company is Disney, the magic isn&rsquo;t what drives consumers through the door. Take risks that are measurable, reasonable, and worthwhile</p><p> Shouting from the rooftops doesn&rsquo;t produce great marketing anymore. Marketers have to expose themselves to risk in order to produce results for their companies. They have the tools, the climate, and the product. The only thing they don&rsquo;t have is an excuse to not get started.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-04 19:33:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-04 19:33:30.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-your-company-cowardice-is-leaving-money-on-the-table/\", \"post_id\": \"7840\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-04 19:33:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-04 19:33:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-your-company-cowardice-is-leaving-money-on-the-table\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7839\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3653\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ideas-changing-the-world.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"660\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449486000,"author_id":436,"chart_url":""}

However, according to a 2014 study by the FPA Research and Practice Institute&trade;, many advisors aren&rsquo;t taking the right steps when it comes to effectively getting their message out.</h3><p> <br/> Many financial professionals know they should be communicating on a regular basis. But time gets in the way or a blank computer screen and a lack of creativity may become big roadblocks.</p><p> Before you begin to craft a newsletter or reach out to clients, consider the smart ways below that offer actionable ideas and reasons why consistent communication is vital to your business success.</p><h3> 1. Visibility quickly comes to mind.</h3><p> Do you want your clients wondering why they never hear from you? Whether by email or a hard copy (or both), you can consistently stay in front of clients with valued-added material. Some clients will occasionally engage and create a meaningful dialogue based on the content you provide, while others have a handy contact point simply going to their inbox. Either way, you are just a mouse-click away.</p><h3> 2. Set yourself apart.</h3><p> Clients really do appreciate that you are keeping them informed, but many financial advisors fail to fully leverage this vital form of communications. By regularly sending communiqu&eacute;s, you send the message that you are the subject matter expert/a trusted resource, and it enhances your brand.</p><p> Your newsletters become another tool to demonstrate your expertise to clients. Plus, you might be surprised that clients will forward your information to family and friends, creating a pool of potential prospects.</p><h3> 3. Write conversationally.</h3><p> You aren&rsquo;t writing an academic paper to leaders in your industry! Prospects reach out to you because they don&rsquo;t understand the financial maze in front of them. But you do! Communicate in terms they will grasp. Draw verbal pictures, use illustrations, and employ simple analogies.</p><p> I saw a study several years ago that consumers have a better understanding of what their auto mechanic just told them than the information that comes from their financial advisor. Put another way, stay away from jargon! If you feel you must use jargon, then take the time to explain the terms in language they will grasp. Those one or two extra sentences will pay dividends.</p><p> 4. What message do you want to reach clients with?</p><p> You are blessed with an enormous body of knowledge and experience &ndash; share it! Did you recently attend a conference highlighting important trends that directly affect clients? Could you discuss market trends that clients should be aware of, or ones that are simply noise? What about a recent client event?</p><h3> 5. Personalize it.</h3><p> Your clients want to know something about you, and more than just the fact that you&rsquo;re a smart man or woman. Before writing about how the knowledge you absorbed from that industry conference will benefit them, you may want to briefly share a story about how much and why you enjoyed your travels.</p><h3> 6. Go one step further.</h3><p> As a corollary to the step above, feel free to share pictures of your company picnic or annual holiday party. It humanizes you and makes you more relatable.</p><h3> 7. Dealing with emotions.</h3><p> No matter how we communicate the value of the long-term plan, market volatility will inevitably arise. Even if most of your clients won&rsquo;t contact you, they are probably stewing over what is happening to their investments.</p><p> Reach out before they do. Let them know you are engaged and closely monitoring the situation. But before launching into the hard facts, empathize and let them know you are available to address any of their concerns. Listen closely.</p><p> After touching on the market-based themes, remind them that their financial plan incorporates the occasional traffic jam, and detours are rarely fruitful.</p><p> By communicating on a regular basis with your clients, you help cement your position as the trusted advisor. It adds to your credibility during a market crisis, which in hindsight, is usually just another bump in the road on the way to the client&rsquo;s financial goals.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-04 19:45:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-04 19:45:13.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-importance-of-client-communications-7-reasons-to-regularly-reach-out-to-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"7842\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-04 19:45:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-04 19:45:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-importance-of-client-communications-7-reasons-to-regularly-reach-out-to-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7841\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3654\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/client-communications.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1725\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449484200,"author_id":101,"chart_url":""}

His initiative features increased access to mental health services for all New Yorkers, in recognition of the causal link between mental health issues and homelessness in New York.</p><p> To drive home that mental health is everybody&rsquo;s issue, de Blasio makes the announcement surrounded by his immediate family. And in conversation with NPR&rsquo;s Linda Wertheimer, his outspoken wife Chirlane McCray by his side, de Blasio explains his family&rsquo;s very personal link to mental health.</p><p> Chirlane and I both talk publicly about recognizing now, as adults, what our parents were going through, depression in the case of Chirlane's parents and alcoholism and PTSD in the case of my father. And then, you know, what happens to us as a couple, our own daughter, Chiara, went through both substance abuse and anxiety challenges. And so, you know, we can't say we're going to address this problem and break down the stigma but not talk about the fact that it's in our own lives.</p><p> This, of course, is not an Energy Boost about mental health.</p><h3> We&rsquo;re talking context and social risk.</h3><p> <br/> Yes, de Blasio got it right. His family story made me listen. Made me care more deeply about a cause I thought I knew. Not with data. No, with well-considered self-revelation.</p><p> Risky? Yes.</p><p> De Blasio plays the game we all play every day. Context and social risk. Business meeting. First date. Cocktail party. Holiday gathering. Official announcement.</p><h3> What to tell, what to withhold.</h3><p> <br/> Most of us went to the school of playing it safe and transgressing only under the influence. Not superior training for charting a deeply connected life. Each time we play it safe, we run from context, shun social risk.</p><p> Prime holiday season is upon us. Chock full of social occasions, the professional and the personal kind. A veritable playground of context and risk.</p><p> Why not play a bit of the self-revelation game? Play it well. These will be your rewards for considered self-revelation:</p><p> I will care about you. More.</p><p> I will care about the causes you champion. More.</p><p> I will commit to you.

{"original_id":3538,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Do So Many Investors and Investment Advisors Do So Poorly?","link":"why-do-so-many-investors-and-investment-advisors-do-so-poorly","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Over 25 years of writing this column, I have often discussed the value of a static buy-and-hold asset allocation with periodic rebalancing. This means investing specific percentages of your portfolio in several asset classes (a few of which are stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate). Then, at least once a year, you buy or sell gains or losses to readjust each asset class back to the original target allocation.</p><h3> Doing this can keep you from making \"the big mistake\" of investing. Maybe I should say \"the big, lethal, fatal, mistake\" of investing.</h3><p> <br/> An April 8, 2015, <u>  <a href=\"http://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/20150408-streettalk-live-dalbar-why-investors-suck-and-tips-for-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u> in Advisor Perspectives by Lance Roberts of Streetalk Live sheds some new light on the real value of maintaining a static buy-and-hold strategy. Roberts cites data from the 21st annual Quantitative Analysis Of Investor Behavior done by <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dalbar, Inc  </a>  . </u> It shows that investing in a static buy-and-hold strategy, allocated 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds, in 2014 would have earned an additional $6,830 on every $100,000 invested, compared to the average amounts such portfolios actually earned.</p><p> The Dalbar study found the average return (for both do-it-yourself investors and investment advisors) on a 60/40 portfolio from 1984 to 2014 was a dismal 2.56% a year. The average annual return of the buy-and-hold strategy was 9.68%, meaning the average investor and investment advisor left 7.12% of return on the table every year.</p><p> Put into dollars, investors and investment advisors earned about $25,000 on every million invested in the stock market. Had they simply put that million into a buy-and-hold strategy allocated to 60% stocks and 40% bonds and left it alone, they would have earned $96,000 a year. That&rsquo;s a loss of $71,000 annually.</p><h3> Why do so many investors and investment advisors do so poorly?</h3><p> <br/> The biggest reason listed by Roberts, which is supported by my own observation, is psychology. Investors exhibit behavioral biases that lead to poor investment decision-making. Dalbar listed nine irrational investment behavior biases that reduce returns and found two of them were the most significant: the \"herding effect\" and \"loss aversion.\" It's human nature both to want to follow what everyone else does and to be afraid of losing what we have. Taken together, these can lead to investing disaster.</p><p> Roberts explains that as markets rise, investors come to believe that \"things are better\" and the current upward trend will continue indefinitely. The longer the trend lasts, the more ingrained this belief becomes. Eventually, the market enters a euphoric time of price increases when the last of the unbelieving holdouts finally buy in.</p><h3> When the market inevitably declines, investors first view the dips as buying opportunities.</h3><p> <br/> As markets drift lower, there is a slow realization that the decline is something more than a \"buy the dip\" opportunity. As losses mount, fear of loss increases until investors can&rsquo;t stand the heightened feelings of anxiety and seek to avert further loss by selling. This whole process results in most investors \"buying high/selling low\" and runs counter to the buy low/sell high investment rule.</p><p> Put in more basic terms, the reason most investors and advisors do so poorly is they try to \"time\" or beat the market. The study found that while most investors and advisors guess right 67% of the time, they were not able to come close to equaling a buy-and-hold strategy.</p><p> What can you do to keep from sabotaging your own investment strategy? It becomes imperative to put a system in place which will make it difficult for your brain to panic in a downturn. Next week we will explore some options for such a system.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-04 20:39:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-04 20:39:23.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-do-so-many-investors-and-investment-advisors-do-so-poorly/\", \"post_id\": \"7848\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-04 20:39:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-04 20:39:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-do-so-many-investors-and-investment-advisors-do-so-poorly\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7847\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3657\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poor-investing-results.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"680\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449478800,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

And reach is good! In sales and marketing, you want a large group of people who understand what you have to offer. Reach just doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story.</h3><p> <br/> A small, passionate community of like-minded people can often accomplish far more than a larger, less-connected group working on the same challenge. Building a dedicated community takes effort, but it&rsquo;s one of the most effective ways to build your brand. The power of relationships scales up when you create opportunities for passionate people to connect.</p><h3> Small Communities Consistently Tackle Big Tasks</h3><p> <br/> Shared knowledge is one of the biggest benefits of community. When you&rsquo;re trying to decide between the latest iPhone or Galaxy, or you want to learn how to calibrate your new TV, you visit a blog, message board, or social page dedicated to tech. The level of detail and responsiveness you get from that community will far surpass anything you could piece together by pulling data from disparate sources.</p><p> Whether the community is sponsored by Samsung or Apple is almost irrelevant, as both brands get a boost from the brainpower of the passionate communities surrounding their products. Building communities is what we do as humans, and it goes much further than just gathering an audience. Getting that audience fired up about something, getting them to bond, explodes the power of word of mouth. It makes things happen.</p><p> For instance, nothing brings out the community spirit quite like troubleshooting a challenge.  <u>  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lifehacker  </a> </u> , for one, has built a vibrant blogging community around the concept of finding new, unique solutions to nagging everyday problems. The same concept works within a larger company&mdash;sometimes, you just need to put a few passionate people on a problem and get out of the way.</p><p> Twitter is a great marketing tool because communities pop up almost organically. It&rsquo;s compartmentalized but not contained. Communities cross over into one another and intersect in places you&rsquo;d never expect. By bringing together people from different backgrounds, you get a more robust conversation&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re talking about  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/astrophysics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   exciting advances in astrophysics  </u>    </a> or brainstorming ideas for a world-class event.</p><p> Communities can accomplish a lot when assembled to solve a problem, but that&rsquo;s not the only benefit to building a passionate group. When people organize to talk about your products or services, the most passionate members of the group double as great advocates. You do your part by creating an excellent product and encouraging conversation, while the relationships you build help spread the word beyond the bounds of your community.</p><p> So don&rsquo;t get hung up on the size of your network. Instead, whether it&rsquo;s around a cause, a topic of interest, or developing your next product or service&hellip; work on ways to connect that network into, and empower/enable, vibrant communities. Networks are just a series of nodes, communities supports each other, looks out for each other, and have lifeblood. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of the &ldquo;collective.&rdquo;</p><p> This originally appeared on  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ted Rubin  </a> </u> .</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-05 15:37:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-05 15:37:26.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/network-gives-you-reach-community-gives-you-power/\", \"post_id\": \"7850\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-05 15:37:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-05 15:37:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"network-gives-you-reach-community-gives-you-power\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7849\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3658\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/community-is-power.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"630\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449495000,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

You could reach a lot of people cost effectively, generate a fair bit of attention and translate that into new client or sales opportunities at a reasonable conversion rate.</p><p> The rapid adoption of social media sites to communicate one-to-one means email is now getting crowded out to a certain degree.

There is a need and a chance to give them a heads up on a pervasive problem they may not know about:  <strong>  the grandma scam. </strong>   Although the government, local agencies and sometimes the media publicize these predatory traps for elders, somehow the word doesn&rsquo;t get around fast or far enough. Here at <a href=\"http://www.agingparents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   AgingInvestor.com  </u> </a> , we work with a lot of families who have elders and we&rsquo;ve been sounding the alarm since 2007 on this one. But it persists.  <strong>  Intellingent people, doctors, lawyers, professionals and non professionals alike are being victimized.  Anyone can be caught off guard. </strong></p><h3> Here&rsquo;s how  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grandparent-scam-explained-by-former-scammer-what-you-need-to-know/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the grandma scam  </a> </u>  works &ndash;</h3><p> <br/> A call from a young person is made to the targeted older person, often at night, after the aging person is asleep. Half awake, grandma answers the phone.   <strong>  &rdquo;It&rsquo;s me, Grandma&rdquo; </strong> the caller says. Grandma immediately falls into the trap and says <strong>  &ldquo;Michael, is that you?&rdquo; </strong> Or any grandchild who is named instantly becomes the identity of the caller.   <strong>  &rdquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Michael&rdquo; </strong> the scammer says quickly. He then says he&rsquo;s in trouble in some named city far away or even a foreign country.  He&rsquo;s lost his passport, or been arrested, he&rsquo;s in the hospital, he&rsquo;s very sick, or some concocted tale of needing help desperately. There is pain in his voice. He says how much he loves his Grandma and please don&rsquo;t tell his parents.  He needs money right away for the bill or for a laywer to get him out of jail or to get a new passport, etc.  Would Grandma please wire the money?  The targeted victim has to act right away. But repeatedly, older gullible people are swayed by the feeling of wanting to help a grandchild in need.  And they don&rsquo;t take time to think.</p><p> Grandma is so concerned, she gets that cash wired to the scammer right away.  She doesn&rsquo;t check anything out and she doesn&rsquo;t call her son or daughter, the parents of the fake grandchild.  It takes a while before she realizes she&rsquo;s been had.  Millions of dollars are lost this way, in smaller amounts at a time.  No matter how much the press reports this kind of scam, the thieves keep at it, as they know that about one in fifty calls will result in getting money from an unsuspecting person.</p><p> Why are these con artists getting away with it?  Dialing for dollars all day is quicker and easier than robbing a bank and it gets better results.  The con artists rarely get caught. The money, once wired, is gone forever from the victim. And due to shame and embarrassment, victims rarely report the scam artists to the police.  Con men buy names from subscription lists with likely senior citizen readers or  from other information brokers.  Some have the ages of their targets and their addreses. Sometimes the more sophisticated ones  have even researched the names of family members, so calling Grandma is more likely to sound credible. If the caller&rsquo;s voice isn&rsquo;t recognizable, there is always an excuse: I have a cold, I&rsquo;m really sick, or anything that works to persuade Grandma it&rsquo;s really her grandson.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the takeaway?</h3><p> <br/> Your aging loved one can be easily tricked under the right circumstances.  Wanting a call from grandkids is the starting point for scammers. It triggers an emotional response to the plea for help.  &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; is something the grandparent wants to hear and the emotional hook is the basis of the con man&rsquo;s success.

But this \"small, but crucial <u> branding element</u>\" is one that few companies have under control. \"There are two reasons why marketers ignore the personal email communication channel:<li> They never thought of it</li><li> The personal email system is provided and operated by the IT department (personal emaiils are considered IT and not marketing territory)</li>Marketing and sales channels are increasingly becoming digital but marketing and sales executives lack digital skills!\"...Executives must learn how to use and communicate on these new digital channels. But the learning curve is apparently steep and long and marketers and sales executives struggle to acquire the new skills required.\" With more and more people browsing and engaging online, those in sales have skills to learn.

I predict that B2B salespeople are going to become more strategic to growth than ever. Yes, digital technology is having a profound effect on B2B sales models.

Many people in your area of expertise might be successful, but not the right fit for you. Wondering who to pick?\"Your prospects should have a solid connection to what you're trying to do.\" They don't have to be directly related to your field but you and your mentor should have similar type goals. Look at a couple different options, review what they do and what you admire about them. Next?Make the call. \"The thing to remember when you're first establishing contact with you mentor prospect is that you're not just out to be a leech.\" Call them upmm, email them, get to know them on a personal level. And remember that there is no such thing as a one way relationship.

Give the Gift of Financial Stability","link":"holiday-shopping-give-the-gift-of-financial-stability","source_link":null,"content":"<p> With Black Friday behind us and Christmas fast approaching, many will be gearing up for travel, spending time with loved ones and, of course, checking off those holiday shopping lists. And while you may be dazzled by this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hottest Tech Gifts&rsquo; or &lsquo;Must Have Toys,&rsquo; consider giving gifts that will keep on giving long after the holidays, especially when it comes to kids and young adults.</p><h3> When I was 12 years old, my grandfather gave me what I thought was the worst Christmas gift ever&mdash;shares of a publicly traded stock.</h3><p> <br/> Typically, he would give us a cash gift, so this was new and unexpected.  He showed me how to look up the stock in the newspaper and track the price. Along with the gift, he taught me about long-term investing, dividends, and other valuable investing lessons. The stock went up and down with varying economic events, but we never sold.</p><h3> The stock happened to perform well, and when I turned 22, the worst Christmas gift ever became the down payment for my first home.</h3><p> <br/> While there are seemingly endless gift options this holiday season, consider one of the non-traditional presents below to help put your loved ones on the path to success:</p><h3> SparkGift.</h3><p> A great alternative to cash (or clothes that kids grow out of), SparkGift offers a simple way to gift shares of stock or mutual fund hassle-free. The site lets you buy fractional shares from individual stocks to shares in a variety of exchange-traded funds, and you can spend anywhere from $20 to $2,000. This concept can serve as a great way teach kids about investing or saving. And, if the recipient holds on to it for a long time period, that gift can keep on giving.</p><h3> Banking Basics. </h3><p> With most schools on break, December could be a great time to teach kids and young adults about money. Whether it&rsquo;s a traditional piggy bank or a bank account, it&rsquo;s important to start the savings conversation sooner than later. Helping a child establish their first account &ndash; a foundation of financial education &ndash; creates an opportunity to teach about savings, fees and interest. Rather than just opening an account at your current bank, ask your kids to help you research finding the right bank. Understanding the basics and developing good habits early on can be very beneficial to their financial future.</p><h3> Start a 529. </h3><p> Known as a qualified tuition plan, a 529 is a savings plan designed to cover future education costs at qualified colleges across the U.S. It offers great tax benefits and an option to make a one-time contribution or set up continuous payments. Opening or contributing to the plan for the holidays is yet another opportunity to discuss the ins and outs of finances with your loved ones. Also, consider asking relatives to contribute to the plan as part of their gift&mdash;with minimum contributions starting as low as $50, family members can partake in setting up kids and young adults for a lifetime of success.</p><p> When it comes to financial well-being, it&rsquo;s never too early to start saving for the future, and the holidays present a great opportunity to get your loved ones off on the right foot. So, no matter which non-traditional gift you choose, know you&rsquo;re doing your part in setting them up for success. <strong>  Happy holidays! </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-05 16:59:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-05 16:59:35.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/holiday-shopping-give-the-gift-of-financial-stability/\", \"post_id\": \"7863\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-05 16:59:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-05 16:59:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"holiday-shopping-give-the-gift-of-financial-stability\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7862\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3664\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gifting-financial-stability.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"600\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449514800,"author_id":470,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3547,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Can We Help Employees Work More Efficiently?","link":"how-can-we-help-employees-work-more-efficiently","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Are your employees working hard, working smart, or both? </h3><p> <br/> I've previously written about  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/10/reduce-employee-effort-for-great.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employee effort </a>  and  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/11/empower-employees-to-increase.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employee empowerment </a> . In this post, I'll tackleemployee efficiency.</p><p> How is that different from the other two? Let's start by defining efficiency or being efficient, and then I'll come back to that question.</p><p> According to  <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/efficiency?s=t\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dictionary.com </a> , efficiency is: the state or quality of being efficient, or able to accomplish something with the least waste of time and effort; competency in performance; accomplishment of or ability to accomplish a job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort. </p><p> If we reduce employee effort and increase employee empowerment, the outcome ought to be improved employee efficiency. If we hire the right employees*, if our employees are engaged and passionate about what they do, the outcome ought to be improved employee efficiency; they'll find the right way to work.</p><h3> *Inefficiencies can be introduced when we hire the wrong people - those who don't have the right skills or who just don't know how to get the job done. Inefficiencies can also be introduced when we ask employees to do more than they are capable of doing in the allotted time, often resulting in burnout.</h3><p> Assuming the two items mentioned in the previous paragraph are not a factor, how do we know if our employees are or aren't working efficiently? First, we can see where they are wasting time, effort, and materials. Second, we can measure efficiency with various metrics. Of course, the key is not to focus on the metrics but on the outcomes. When we identify an inefficient process, let's fix it - not beat up the employee for doing what he was told to do with the tools he was given. And third, employees can tell us about the inefficiencies themselves.</p><p> How can we fix inefficiencies? First we need to understand them; we need to uncover why the employee is not working efficiently. To do that, there are two great tools:</p><h3> 1. Journey mapping: </h3><p> <br/> When we walk in the employee's shoes and map what he is trying to do, we can easily identify areas of the process that are painpoints, that are taking more steps than reasonable, or that are being done with the wrong tools. Bottom line, mapping can help call out inefficiencies in any process. Map from the employee's perspective and incorporate the employee's voice and feedback into the map to ensure you really understand what he's going through or dealing with.</p><h3> 2. Root cause analysis: </h3><p> <br/> It provides us with answers - not off-the-cuff answers but drill-deep-down answers - to product or service issues. Sometimes the answers are not the obvious. We need to step back and think deeper about why things are the way they are. I like using 5 Whys to conduct root cause analysis. How it works: State the problem and then ask \"Why?\" five times to drill down to the ultimate cause. You can adapt this process to your needs; sometimes asking \"Why?\" five times is too many, and sometimes you need to ask it more than five times. </p><p> How can we help employees work more efficiently? In a nutshell, we need to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to meet the day's challenges. How do we achieve this?</p><li> <strong>  Open and ongoing communication: </strong> let's ensure employees are working on the right things, things that matter; if we're not talking to them regularly about what's on their plates and what's important, they may be spending too much time on low or lesser priority items. Help them prioritize.</li><li> <strong>  Eliminate ambiguity and uncertainty: </strong> vagueness is the absence of clarity, which is required for employees to know what is expected of them, both in their roles within the company and how what they do contributes and relates to the customer experience.</li><li> <strong>  Culture: </strong> think about your workplace culture. Does it encourage or inhibit productivity? Is yours a culture that supports employee innovation and values employees who question \"why do we still do things this way?\"</li><li> <strong>  Teamwork: </strong> when people collaborate or work in teams, the hope is that they find better ways to work together and get the job done. (That's the hope; it doesn't always work out that way.)</li><li> <strong>  Feedback: </strong> give employees feedback about their work but also listen to their input and opinions about how things are getting done. Don't discount their opinions and what they have to say. Ask them about their work and about inefficiencies and listen for painpoints. Then do something about it.</li><li> <strong>  Share best practices: </strong> if someone's doing it right or doing something well, don't be shy about sharing that approach with others.</li><li> <strong>  Help and support employees: </strong> when they say they need it, act.</li><li> <strong>  Consistency: </strong> stay the course in what you are doing (unless change is desperately needed, especially to introduce efficiencies); constant change causes everyone to have to adjust, adapt, start over, and lose efficiencies.</li><li> <strong>  Education and training: </strong> the better educated your employees are about the task at hand, the vision, the mission, the brand promise, your products, the desired customer experience, etc., the smarter they will work.</li><li> <strong>  Outcomes: </strong> make sure employees understand and focus on the desired outcome.</li><li> <strong>  Goals: </strong> make sure employees have reasonable goals; re-evaluate those goals and make sure they are tied to the desired outcome. Make sure goals and expectations are clearly communicated.</li><li> <strong>  Skills: </strong> ensure employees' skills are matched to the role and to the customer need.</li><li> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> model and reward the behaviors you want to continue, especially those that simplify getting the job done (right).</li><li> <strong>  Tools and resources: </strong> ensure employees have the right tools and resources to do the job.</li><li> <strong>  Automation: </strong> any time you can automate manual processes, you're sure to introduce efficiencies.</li><p> I'm sure there are other - perhaps more tactical - ways to help employees work more efficiently. But if you can get some of the basics down, you should see immediate progress.</p><h3> Work smarter, not harder? Yes, that's what they say. Me? I think there's room for both. Work smart and work hard. Nothing wrong with that.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Working hard and working smart sometimes can be two different things. -Byron Dorgan </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-07 15:51:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-07 15:51:56.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-can-we-help-employees-work-more-efficiently/\", \"post_id\": \"7867\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-07 15:51:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-07 15:51:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-can-we-help-employees-work-more-efficiently\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7866\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3666\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/working-efficiently.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"640\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449586800,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

Now you are busy posting engaging, relevant content to your digital channels.</h3>Job done, right?Well, not exactly. Now it&rsquo;s time to think about leveraging your content, increasing its reach and ensuring that it&rsquo;s seen, heard and acted upon by your target audience through other channels as well. And that means media &ndash; still a vital part of the integrated communications holy trinity of &ldquo;paid, earned, owned&rdquo;.There&rsquo;s never enough budget for everything, so it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you should either produce content to fill your owned publishing outlets, or take the traditional approach of preparing stories for media. The reality is that a successful integrated public relations strategy uses a mixture of both.Content marketing drives thought-leadership, page-ranking advantage and develops trust between your brand and your target market, but PR plays just as important, complementary role. Because media outlets rank highly on search engines, earned media can be very powerful in amplifying your messages and driving potential customers to your brand.Enter the PR strategy &ndash; and yes, we have come full circle on this &ndash; because instead of &ldquo;Content as PR&rdquo; we are now looking to &ldquo;PR-ing the content&rdquo;!Here are some simple tips to help you.<h3> 1. SEO optimisation is king</h3>Last week&rsquo;s blog, &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"/sell/marketing/the-unlikely-marriage-of-pr-and-seo-and-five-tips-to-make-the-match\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The unlikely marriage of PR and SEO </a></u>&rdquo;, describes the new reality of integrated public relations, which is that PR and SEO go hand in hand.After all, they are both about reaching the right people, making connections and creating visibility, which means that your search results and your reputation are directly linked.Page 1 of Google search results is the new &ldquo;front page&rdquo;, so working out ways of appealing to Google&rsquo;s algorithm is your best shot at getting front page coverage. For our five tips to achieve this, look <u> here</u>.<h3> 2. A salute to the survey</h3>Media by its nature is about &ldquo;news&rdquo;. So think about what makes news and then use your resources to make some &ldquo;news&rdquo; yourself. One way to do this is to run a survey then PR the hard data results. The trick here of course is to choose your topic carefully &ndash; make sure your questions (hence resulting findings) are relevant and interesting both to your audience and the media. The three &ldquo;G&rsquo;s&rdquo; are a great way to consider slicing and dicing results to gain optimum media interest: generation, gender, geography. A well designed survey can give you strong content and PR value that can last six months or longer- if you plan and conduct it properly.<h3> 3. Personality matters</h3>People love people and (especially in this age of celebrity) people are news. Look for opportunities to partner with interesting individuals (a.k.a <u> influencers</u>) to build the &ldquo;news value&rdquo; of announcements, launches, thought leadership and other activities you undertake.<strong> So, next time you&rsquo;re looking at your content plan, think like a PR professional: what is news?</strong>What is new, different, the &ldquo;first&rdquo; the &ldquo;biggest&rdquo; the &ldquo;only&rdquo;. And shape a portion of your content accordingly.

{"original_id":3549,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Awaiting the DOL Storm","link":"awaiting-the-dol-storm","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> <strong>  What you can do to prepare for the pending fiduciary rule </strong></h3><p> <br/> You know the feeling: a local weather forecaster advises us that a disturbance is forming off the coast. Looking at several different weather models, they only know one thing for certain: the storm will hit, but we&rsquo;re not exactly sure when or how strong it will be. Of course, we all react and rightfully so, as we need to protect what&rsquo;s ours. We&rsquo;re anxious, unsure of what&rsquo;s to come, leaving many worried about their future.</p><p> That&rsquo;s pretty much the same feeling advisors are sharing about the pending Department of Labor&rsquo;s proposal to impose the fiduciary standard on retirement accounts. It&rsquo;s a storm of anxiety and uncertainty raining on every advisor whether they work for a behemoth wirehouse or are a small independent.</p><p> Truth be told, the DOL rule is indeed casting a cloud over the industry as it will likely affect everyone, regardless of whether or not you service retirement accounts, as everyone to some degree is expected to be subject to greater compliance oversight.</p><h3> Battening down the hatches <br/>  </h3><p> While all firms will need to interpret the rules and then define guidelines, it&rsquo;s the wirehouses and independent broker dealers who will likely need to be far more stringent and inclusive, as they must create mandates for the organization at large; i.e., tens of thousands of advisors, taking the lowest common denominator into account. So whether you service retirement plans or not, you will be beholden to rules created for those who do.</p><p> In order to maintain profitability &ndash; and limit compliance exposure &ndash; wirehouses and IBDs are likely to cull their service offerings. Therefore, advisors who serve clients with commission-based retirement accounts are likely to see a reduction of available products, and experience an impact on their own ability to generate revenue.</p><p> Conversely, RIAs will have more latitude with which to interpret the new rules because they are looking at a smaller number of advisors who service a like client base, rather than a disparate one. Most importantly, RIAs are already fiduciaries, serving clients in a fee-based model. They, too, will need to come up with a way to respond and ensure compliance, but they can do so in a more customized and flexible manner.</p><h3> Changes in the landscape <br/>  </h3><p> In a recent article on WealthManagement.com, Morningstar analyst Michael Wong speculated that the &ldquo;entire value chain&rdquo; will be affected by the rule, resulting in fewer commission-based products available to investors, as well as a decline in the overall number of financial advisors. Other theorists expect attrition levels at wirehouses and IBDs to increase as advisors look for more flexible, independent options.</p><p> Ultimately, everyone agrees we can expect to see a wave of M&amp;A in the independent space as it&rsquo;s going to get more complicated and expensive to do business. Smaller firms will often not have the resources &ndash; or finances &ndash; to manage the new standards. In order to survive, many will need to join forces with larger firms, thereby taking advantage of greater scale and a more robust infrastructure&mdash;and the likelihood of having a compliance officer already in place.</p><h3> How should I be preparing? <br/>  </h3><p> Given the uncertainty around the rule, you should be using the next few months to answer the following questions:</p><p> Do I believe in the fiduciary standard and how will my client base respond to the new rules?</p><p> Does practicing under a broker-dealer umbrella continue to serve me given the fact that these models could mean more bureaucracy and less flexibility, freedom and control?</p><p> Roger, a $6mil wirehouse advisor called me the other day to &ldquo;pick my brain.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Up until recently, I dismissed independence. The past five years have been great: I doubled my production, I doubled assets, I hired a few people. Now I look around the office and I&rsquo;m the biggest producer by a factor of 3. To be held to the same standard as others who run far less profitable and productive businesses than me seems unfair. I worry that the rules will impact not only the way I service my retirement accounts (which only represent less than 3% of my annual revenue), but how I service every account. That&rsquo;s not how I want to do business.&rdquo;</p><p> Roger knows that just like a predicted storm, no one knows how the rules will change or what the impact will be until it happens. What we do know is that there will be a change and the only thing you have control over is how ready you are to respond to it. Now is the time, while we wait for word from the DOL, to do your soul searching, to think about your goals for your business and clients, and determine if where you work and how you currently practice will still be right for you in a world with new rules. Getting educated about the industry landscape and maybe even exploring your options during this time of relative calm is wise  Here&rsquo;s the thing to remember: you hold all the cards. You run a successful business, you have loyal clients, and if you are making decisions based on what&rsquo;s right for all constituencies, you will ride out this storm and thrive.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-07 18:50:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-07 18:50:02.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/awaiting-the-dol-storm/\", \"post_id\": \"7871\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-07 18:50:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-07 18:50:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"awaiting-the-dol-storm\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7870\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3669\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Awaiting-the-DOL-Storm.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"766\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449567900,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

Peter&rsquo;s father needs help and has no money, but if we spend it helping, we don&rsquo;t have the resources to put money away for our kids&rsquo; education.&rdquo;</p><p> So what can you do if you&rsquo;re stuck in the middle of this new and difficult life stage? Here are five &ldquo;Cs&rdquo; to keep in mind.</p><li> <strong>  Communicate. </strong>  Ask for help, talk to everyone involved and lay out all the facts. This is no time to circle the wagons and try to handle everything yourself.</li><li> <strong>  Community. </strong>  Reach out to the appropriate groups for guidance and assistance. Other parents, gerontologists, siblings, support groups, anyone and everyone who might have useful information. Find a great therapist to help support YOU and your family while you&rsquo;re trying to juggle all these different needs.</li><li> <strong>  Choose. </strong>  Choose what resources you have to devote to each part of your life. Time, money, energy and attention are all resources that must be doled out appropriately. Make sure you speak with your CPA, attorney, financial planner, etc. for their input on financial and legal matters. Remember, you can&rsquo;t get more than 24 hours out of a day and you cannot spend more money than you have. Choices&mdash;albeit difficult ones&mdash;need to be made.</li><li> <strong>  Consciousness. </strong>  Be aware that guilt is a sure fire condition that will lead to the wrong answers for the wrong reasons. Your awareness of your financial resources and what will negatively impact your ability to thrive is key in getting through this challenge.</li><li> <strong>  Capital.  </strong> Protect your capital from poor decisions made from emotions. Capital can come in the form of time or money. It&rsquo;s too easy when you&rsquo;re stretched beyond reason to make in-the-heat-of-the-moment decisions that ultimately are not in anyone&rsquo;s best interest. <br/>  </li><p> Everyone&rsquo;s situation is unique, so resist believing that if someone you know handled things one way, that that is the perfect way. There are parents whose parents are extremely wealthy and some who wait for their social security check to pay for groceries. There are situations where there are siblings who help out financially and share time to help, while others are in this alone. There is no one right answer. There&rsquo;s only the answer that solves as many problems as possible.</p><p> If you find yourself caught up between generations needing your help, time and resources, take a step back and assess what is most important to you and what you can rationally provide each person in need.  It&rsquo;s rarely easy, quick and painless, but if you focus on those 5 C&rsquo;s, you may just uncover the 6th C. Clarity.  Good luck.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-07 18:55:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-07 18:55:01.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-sandwich-generation-5-cs-to-deal-with-your-financial-challenges/\", \"post_id\": \"7873\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-07 18:55:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-07 18:55:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-sandwich-generation-5-cs-to-deal-with-your-financial-challenges\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7872\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3670\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-C\\u2019s-To-Deal-With-Your-Financial-Challenges-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"985\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449583200,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

From Fintech to Science to Life Sciences, every aspect of humanity is being turned upside down.  We can invent humans from beakers in labs to synthetics in production lines. Although we aren&rsquo;t quite there yet, the recent series  Humans  illustrated the near-term future well, with synthetic humans acting as carers and cleaners, taking the jobs others don&rsquo;t want or aren&rsquo;t prepared to do.  There&rsquo;s a great line in the series where the Detective in charge of finding the synthetics that have morphed into humans &ndash; they have feelings &ndash; has had heart surgery and is fitted with a pacemaker.  When he finds the synthetic human he says: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of human inside the machine, and some of the machine inside the human&rdquo;.  I liked this line as it won&rsquo;t belong before we achieve this hybrid state of cyborgism.  It&rsquo;s being predicted by many scientists and futurists that within our lifetmes, life sciences will find ways to treat humanity's ailments like no other before.  So here are my top picks of the technologies already out there that are changing humanity and will allow us to live for 150 years or more.</p><p> <strong>  Genetically engineered humans </strong></p><p> From the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   May/June 2015  </a> </u>  edition of MIT Technology Review</p><p> &ldquo;Germ line&rdquo; is biologists&rsquo; jargon for the egg and sperm, which combine to form an embryo. By editing the DNA of these cells or the embryo itself, it could be possible to correct disease genes and pass those genetic fixes on to future generations. Such a technology could be used to rid families of scourges like cystic fibrosis. It might also be possible to install genes that offer lifelong protection against infection, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and, Yang told me, maybe the effects of aging. Such history-making medical advances could be as important to this century as vaccines were to the last.  That&rsquo;s the promise. The fear is that germ-line engineering is a path toward a dystopia of superpeople and designer babies for those who can afford it.  </p><p> <strong>  Printing Human Body Parts  </strong></p><p> From CNET,  <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/3d-printed-robotic-prosthetic-wins-uk-james-dyson-award/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   August 2015  </u>    </a></p><p> &ldquo;The Open Bionics hand uses steel cables as tendons that curl the fingers, but these are attached to motors that act as muscles, with each finger individually powered to increase manual dexterity. Because the hand is 3D printed, each one can be modeled specifically for its wearer. The Open Bionics team scans the arm to which the hand is to be fitted and uses that as a basis for the print. The scanning process can be completed within a few minutes.  Once the design is finalised, the hand takes around 40 hours to print and, moreover, the cost is a fraction of the higher end prosthetics. A finished hand would sell for less than &pound;1,000 and it would cost even less if users could make it themselves using the company's open source plans and instructions.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Printing Human Organs </strong></p><p> From the BBC in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34505242\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   October 2015  </a> </u></p><p> &ldquo;To date, medical 3D printing has been mainly used to create prosthetics.  Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in the US, have adapted a low cost MakerBot 3D printer to print with soft materials such as collagens, alginates and fibrins that naturally appear in the body. The team hope their work could one day lead to a world in which transplants are no longer necessary to repair damaged organs.&rdquo;  This would mean that you wouldn&rsquo;t need prosthetics but could just grow a new arm.</p><p> <strong>  Growing Human Body Parts </strong></p><p> From New Scientist in  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630243-300-worlds-first-biolimb-rat-forelimb-grown-in-the-lab/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   June 2015  </a> </u></p><p> &ldquo;It might look like an amputated rat forelimb, but the photo above is of something much more exciting: the limb has been grown in the lab from living cells. It may go down in history as the first step to creating real, biologically functional limbs for amputees.  &lsquo;We&rsquo;re focusing on the forearm and hand to use it as a model system and proof of principle,&rsquo; says Harald Ott of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who grew the limb. &lsquo;But the techniques would apply equally to legs, arms and other extremities.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Seeing Humans from the Inside </strong></p><p> From this month&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/11/23/457129179/the-future-of-nanotechnology-and-computers-so-small-you-can-swallow-them\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   NPR  </u>    </a></p><p> &ldquo;Scientists are working with nanotechnology to send computers inside patients for a more accurate and specific, diagnosis.

{"original_id":3552,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When Prospecting, Don't Push for A Fit","link":"when-prospecting-dont-push-for-a-fit","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Many of my clients ask me about successful prospecting, because it's something that their sales people are struggling with. Developing new business, prospecting, cold calling is the most challenging part of the sales process. After all, you are interrupting somebody's day. It's almost like being on a first date, testing the waters, making sure that there is alignment.</p><p> But, that's exactly what's missing in many situations where sales people are calling on prospects. Making sure that there is alignment.</p><p> Try to put yourself into your prospect's shoes. What would you want to hear when you pick up the phone where somebody is interrupting your day. Would you want to hear a sales pitch, or would you want to listen to somebody who is potentially adding value to your life?</p><h3> It's all about fit <br/>  </h3><p> If there is no fit, there is no reason to have a conversation. But in order for you, the sales person to determine if there could be a fit, you need to do your homework first. Most sales representatives who call me don't know my business, have never visited my website or my LinkedIn profile. They are just rattling off a pitch and in some cases they even stutter around trying to get to a point.</p><h3> Be short and distinct and!! ADD VALUE <br/>  </h3><p> People will appreciate when you get to the point fast. And by that I mean that you need to have a value statement. Let me give you an example. When I call on organizations to pitch our sales training, I always focus on the fact that  <strong>  we help companies Increase Revenue and Profitability by helping them establish a common Sales and Service language. </strong> Something that is really important for organizations with sales people around the country, or the globe for that matter. But this pitch only works with companies who have many sales people in more than one location!</p><h3> Don't focus on features and benefits <br/>  </h3><p> Features and benefits as oppose to value can be mentioned to support your value statement at a later point. For example, the fact that our training is a blended eLearning/customized coaching approach is something that supports the fact that we help our clients increase revenue and profitability by establishing a common Sales and Service language. It's not something that needs to be mentioned first, because there is many other providers who claim to have effective on-line training. It's not a differentiator and eLearning might not be something that is attractive to a company at first. How you get to the results for your client is not something that you want to lead with.</p><h3> Know who you are talking to <br/>  </h3><p> When calling on people. try to understand their role within the organization and their responsibilities. When I call on a CEO (which is always my first outreach, because it's more effective to work your way down, rather than up the ladder), I always focus on the business goals. Top line value statements.</p>Increased Revenue and higher profitability are messages that resonate with CEOs.<p> Once I get to the sales or training manager, my message shifts. Then it's more about the nitty-gritty, the details, ins and outs of the program. Of course, increased revenue and higher profitability are also important to the sales manager, but they also want to make sure that their people don't spend too much time away from their desks, so I talk about the fact that their sales people never have to leave their desk and they will still become more successful.</p><h3> Don't look for a fit if there is none <br/>  </h3><p> No matter how much research you do and how well you prepare for a call, sometimes there is no fit. Don't push it, there is no sense in trying to find alignment if there is none. Reasons can be plentiful. Very often I find that companies don't want to commit to a long-term process, which means that they are not really committed to a consultative sales approach. I could push them, but it wouldn't lead to a successful client engagement. Sometimes, it's best to leave a good impression and to move on.</p><h3> Be personal <br/>  </h3><p> In closing - people buy from people. Be personal. Don't try to sell. We all know that sales people are on the phone or emailing to drum up business, but you need to connect with a person on a human level, make them comfortable and then talk business. Once you have established rapport, it's much easier to have a conversation and to build trust.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-07 19:03:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-07 19:03:41.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-prospecting-dont-push-for-a-fit/\", \"post_id\": \"7876\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-07 19:03:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-07 19:03:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-prospecting-dont-push-for-a-fit\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7875\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3672\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/When-prospecting-dont-push-for-a-fit.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"399\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449590400,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}

Today we deliver on that promise, but if you are not an M&amp;A advisor, don't assume you can overlook this topic. No matter your area of expertise, if you work with owners, your job is to help owners set goals that allow them to determine if a third-party offer is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; to educate them about the sale process and to prepare their companies for sale. ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/proactive-advisors-dont-leave-owners-empty-handed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   See article 1  </a>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/proactive-advisors-dont-leave-owners-empty-handed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   .  </a> </u> )  In the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/preparing-owner-third-party-sale\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   second article  </a> </u> , we outlined the specific steps you take with an owner to accomplish those three tasks. In this article, we describe the effects of the first three, and most common, Deal Killers.  </p><h3> Deal Killer Defined</h3><p> <br/> A Deal Killer is a condition that, if undetected and unresolved before the sale of a business to a third party, will kill the transaction. The purpose of pre-sale planning is to maximize sale profits (as well as to achieve your client&rsquo;s other, and perhaps &ldquo;softer,&rdquo; goals), and it includes efforts to neutralize these Killers.</p><h3> The First Three Deal Killers</h3><p> <br/> There are a number of &ldquo;Deal Killers&rdquo; that, once the sale process begins, live up to their name: they can and will destroy the ability to sell company.  Let&rsquo;s start with the most common, and avoidable, Deal Killers 1, 2 and 3.</p><li> <strong>  Owners&rsquo; belief that they can sell their businesses for enough money today to satisfy their financial independence needs and wants. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The failure to reconcile the owner&rsquo;s need for value with the market&rsquo;s perspective of value before going to market. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The owner&rsquo;s exclusive focus on top-line sale price. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> As you can see, the first three are variations on a theme and a result of owners being individuals who view a glass as half-full.  After all, as Harvard professor Howard Stevenson noted, entrepreneurs started their businesses &ldquo;without regard to resources currently controlled.\" Optimism is likely a necessary quality in starting a business without adequate capital.</p><p> In the context of a business exit, however, optimism can result in owners consistently and often dramatically overvaluing their businesses. The most common complaint we hear from private equity representatives is that owners of successful businesses overvalue their companies and insist on asking prices that are unobtainable. In doing so, they waste time, money, and effort.  In entering the market with an unrealistic asking price and subsequently withdrawing from the market, owners do significant harm to any future effort to sell the business.</p><p> In our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/preparing-owner-third-party-sale\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   last article  </a> </u> , we argued that once you have helped an owner calculate the amount of money necessary to achieve financial independence, &ldquo;It is vital that owners know, before going to market, what the market considers the business to be worth.&rdquo; If you are not an investment banker or business broker, you must work with members of your advisor team to assign an accurate valuation to your clients&rsquo; businesses.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be surprised when the owner&rsquo;s expectations do not match the expert&rsquo;s estimation of the likely sale price range. As we saw with the example of James in the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/proactive-advisors-dont-leave-owners-empty-handed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first article  </a> </u>  in this series, you must factor into the likely sale price deductions of taxes, debt, transaction fees and other costs to help your clients avoid Deal Killer #3.</p><p> Helping  (or, more likely, prodding) owners to seek an expert&rsquo;s estimate of sales price replaces optimism with reality in determining an attainable sale price. If the expert confirms the owner&rsquo;s opinion, you&rsquo;ve provided a data-based opinion at no cost.  More often, however, the professional&rsquo;s realistic estimate does not support owners&rsquo; optimistic estimate. This addresses and solves two problems created by hyper-optimism. The first problem we described earlier: going to market before the business is ready. The second is not devoting time and effort to creating a company with sufficient transferable value to meet their financial and other goals.</p><p> We find that owners who jump into the sale process blinded by sale price optimism (or without consideration of the reductions to sale price) spend considerable time, money and energy only to find their glass half-empty, if not shattered altogether. Your job is to incorporate an understanding of marketplace reality into an owner&rsquo;s pre-sale planning. You know that successful exits can require years of value-building efforts, but owners who think their businesses are worth far more than buyers do, do not.  It is critical to the ultimate success of your clients&rsquo; exits that they realistically assess likely sale price years before their planned departure dates.</p><h3> Are You A Slayer of Deal Killers?</h3><p> <br/> You have the potential to neutralize these three Killers whether or not you are an M&amp;A Advisor.  All BEI-trained advisors appreciate the intricacies of exit planning well enough to understand the need to recruit a best-in-class Advisor Team that includes M&amp;A Advisors.  In assembling their teams, they provide their clients access to vetted business brokers and investment bankers who can determine a likely sale range for a business&mdash;usually at no cost&mdash;before an owner goes to market.  This is an invaluable value-added service for owners. Are you able to offer it to your clients?</p><p> In our next article we will de-fang Deal Killer #4:  The failure to preserve a company&rsquo;s most valuable asset. In the meantime, if you haven&rsquo;t created a relationship with a business broker and investment banker who understands exit planning and their role in it, do yourself and your clients a favor.   <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/does-he-or-doesnt-he-identifying-real-exit-planning-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here  </a> </u>  to view a list of the characteristics that these advisors must have to play a role on your Advisor Team.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-07 19:18:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-07 19:18:49.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/deal-killers-the-case-of-the-glass-half-full/\", \"post_id\": \"7880\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-07 19:18:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-07 19:18:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"deal-killers-the-case-of-the-glass-half-full\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7879\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3674\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-case-of-the-glass-half-full.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"582\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449581400,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3555,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Your 8-Step Guide to Make the Ultimate First Impression","link":"your-8-step-guide-to-make-the-ultimate-first-impression","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I waited to deliver this post until we were in a season when people could benefit most. This is a time of year when people attend holiday parties and other functions and meet many new people. I thought it would be ideal to provide your 8-step guide to make the ultimate first impression.</p><p> I promised myself I&rsquo;d skip all the obvious tips such as being on time, proper grooming, speaking clearly and so forth. If you&rsquo;re taking the time to read this, I owe you  <strong>  my </strong>  experience.</p><p> That experience comes from nearly three decades of consulting. I&rsquo;ve spent the last decade speaking with or meeting an average of 3,500-4,000 new people every year!</p><p> We&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; actual human interaction&mdash;the kind that existed before the invention of email, the Internet, and social media. You simply can&rsquo;t use the delete key or de-friend button if you want to stop the pain.</p><p> Do you remember when the only time you could halt rude people was to cry Mommy, make it stop or risk offending them directly to their faces or ears? Of course you don&rsquo;t.</p><p> Believe me. That time once existed.</p><p> Today, the most successful and happy people still engage interpersonal communication techniques that existed once upon a forgotten era.</p><p> What should you do when the time arises?</p><h3> Observe <br/>  </h3><p> Your first impression starts with your body language. Oftentimes, this occurs before you&rsquo;re aware you&rsquo;re making an impression! Someone might notice you from afar. Your body language, overall posture, and demeanor send a message that echoes like you yelled it in a canyon. Be aware of your surroundings.</p><h3> Smile <br/>  </h3><p> Do you realize even though the corners of your mouth need to rise, smiling takes less energy than frowning? People respond to this because you appear warm, welcoming, and nonjudgmental. They want to share themselves with you and learn about you. If you smile (sincerely), you&rsquo;ll increase your chance of making a positive impression by more than 90%. Take the odds. There, of course, will be an extremely small percentage of cynical people you won&rsquo;t be able to connect with. No loss. You don&rsquo;t need them in your life no matter who they are or what (you think) they offer.</p><h3> Stand <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re smiling and can&rsquo;t get off your rump (those with ailments and elderly ladies aside), you&rsquo;ve completely erased the benefit of your smile. You&rsquo;ve just &ldquo;said,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re not worth it for me to rise. Ouch. Standing also allows you to open up your body language to a more inviting posture.</p><h3> Shake <br/>  </h3><p> Shake hands firmly, which means no dead-fish handshake. Squeezing implies engagement. Dead fishing&hellip;not so much. I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s a man, woman, child, or dog, give them a good shake. I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re in the middle of your $58 filet mignon; make sure you&rsquo;re standing when you do it. If you&rsquo;re wearing a hat, cap, bandana, headband or whatever else people wear on their heads these days, take it off. It&rsquo;s a polished move and shows you&rsquo;re respectful and cool.</p><h3> Introduce <br/>  </h3><p> Introduce yourself with a smile on your face and simultaneously look them in the eyes as you give their palm a good squeeze.</p><h3> Repeat <br/>  </h3><p> Repeat his or her name so you hear it for yourself. This will help you remember it and also give them a chance to correct you if you heard them incorrectly. A simple, &ldquo;Hi John. Nice to meet you,&rdquo; will do the trick. Then, use his or her name optimally. I said optimally. Don&rsquo;t overuse it. That&rsquo;s annoying. Don&rsquo;t underuse it. You risk forgetting it. Why else repeat? The sound of one&rsquo;s own name is one of the most pleasing sounds anyone hears. It just is.</p><h3> Ask <br/>  </h3><p> This is one of the most important steps. It&rsquo;s what truly endears you to people. Withhold simply asking people what they &ldquo;do.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s lazy. They also have no idea why you want to know.</p><p> Did you know that whenever you request something&mdash;anything&mdash;you increase your chances of getting a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; by more than 50% whenever you share your &ldquo;because?&rdquo; That statistic holds true even when your &ldquo;because&rdquo; is flimsy.</p><p> I prefer one of two alternatives that can be used in virtually any setting.</p><p> The first alternative is to ask them what they love. Try something such as, &ldquo;John, what is it you love to do?&rdquo; You can tack on some multiple choices&mdash;hobbies, play, work and so forth. Rarely will their passions coincide with what they do for a living. (Sad, I know. But, there&rsquo;s no reason to risk it.) Get them talking about what they love! People light up when they speak about something they love. You just ensured they would be speaking about something positive as opposed to running the risk of asking them about jobs they loathe.</p><p> The second alternative is the one I truly love. It&rsquo;s a two piece-r. Show them you&rsquo;re a giver. (You need to mean it sincerely or they&rsquo;ll smell the deceit.) Try something such as, &ldquo;Jane, what do you do for work or with most of your time?&rdquo; The reason I ask is because I&rsquo;m a [insert whatever you do]. I&rsquo;m always interested in ways I can help people.&rdquo;</p><p> The reason the &ldquo;most of your time&rdquo; is required is because you have no clue whether they are working, volunteering, staying at home to manage the children, and so on. Give them appropriate segues. You&rsquo;ll think of me the first time you use this technique and receive an unexpected response. Email me when it happens. </p><h3> Listen <br/>  </h3><p> Then shut up and let them talk.</p><p> <strong>  I always love to hear from you: What are your best first-impression tips? </strong></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-07 19:24:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-07 19:24:30.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/your-8-step-guide-to-make-the-ultimate-first-impression/\", \"post_id\": \"7882\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-07 19:24:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-07 19:24:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"your-8-step-guide-to-make-the-ultimate-first-impression\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7881\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3675\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ultimate-First-Impression.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"457\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449572400,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3556,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Differentiating Yourself","link":"differentiating-yourself","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A client of mine&mdash;a senior partner in a large professional firm&mdash;recently voiced the following frustration to me:</p><h3> &ldquo;We are unique in the way that we work with clients, and we offer a clearly superior service. But clients don&rsquo;t seem to recognize this. We should have even more than our share of business.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I responded (probably somewhat unsympathetically), &ldquo;Unfortunately your clients just don&rsquo;t perceive that differentiation. They don&rsquo;t see you as being particularly different compared to your competitors.&rdquo; I challenged him to really explore how his firm was different and whether this actually translated into a perceptibly differentiated and more valuable experience for the client.</p><p> Most professionals have experienced this dilemma. We believe our firms are unique and different and better, but clients don&rsquo;t always share that warm feeling. It gets worse when you&rsquo;re pitching for new business. If you&rsquo;re one of five major investment banks competing for a major deal, and you don&rsquo;t know the client very well, it can feel like a brutal, uphill struggle. How do you demonstrate that you really are different?</p><p> Differentiation in services businesses, more often than not, occurs through the cumulative impact of many small actions. Whereas a product can have demonstrably superior technology and design features&mdash;think Audi&rsquo;s Quattro four wheel drive system, or Apple&rsquo;s integrated multimedia software&mdash;such a clear advantage is harder to achieve and demonstrate for a law firm or consulting firm that sells services rather than physical products.</p><p> So how can you differentiate yourself and your firm? Clearly, the challenge is a bit different depending on whether you are trying to win a client over for the first time or have already established a working relationship. Here is an initial list of ideas for you:</p><h3> When you are first getting to know the client: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Communicating a demonstrated track record of having solved the client&rsquo;s problem many times before. </strong></p><p> <strong>  <strong>   2. Thoughtful questions which implicitly demonstrate your knowledge of the issues.  </strong> </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. Thorough, in-depth preparation. </strong> This sounds pretty basic, but you&rsquo;d be surprised at how many clients have mentioned this to me as a negative&mdash;i.e., they see a lot of outside professionals who come unprepared to their client meetings.</p><p> <strong>  4. Good client examples </strong> &mdash;&ldquo;reference cases&rdquo; that clearly illustrate the client problem, the solution you developed, and the results.</p><p> <strong>  5. Speed and responsiveness. </strong> This could be demonstrated by something as simple as getting a set of thoughtful discussion notes back to the client on the same day as the meeting.</p><p> <strong>  6. By adding value in the conversation. </strong> For example, by:</p><li> Asking questions that really make the client think about the issues</li><li> Challenging assumptions or problem definitions</li><li> Sharing best practices and ideas that relate to the client&rsquo;s issue</li><li> Introducing interesting market and competitive information</li><li> Suggesting novel or counter-intuitive courses of action and implementation approaches</li><li> Asking questions that no one else is asking&mdash;e.g.,&rdquo; Is your organization truly convinced that you need to bring in an outside resource for this?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Overall, helping to clarify a client&rsquo;s thinking about the issue at hand</p><p> <strong>  7. By association: </strong> That is, talking about clients and other relationships with people and companies that the client respects.</p><p> <strong>  8. By rapidly establishing rapport </strong> (identifying things you have in common, empathizing, discovering shared avocations or interests, using humor, etc.)</p><p> <strong>  9. Through high levels of energy, enthusiasm, and passion. </strong> (Do you enjoy people who are low energy, bored by what they do, and lack emotion? I didn&rsquo;t think so).</p><p> <strong>  10 By offering something very tangible that other competitors just don&rsquo;t have. </strong> For example: an investment bank might extend credit (use its balance sheet) in order to win a deal when others are unwilling to do so; you might have proprietary databases, software tools, or other products that accompany your services; by taking on risk; etc.</p><p> <strong>  11. Through values, culture, and organizational factors such as public versus private ownership. </strong> Values and culture can be articulated to clients, and, most importantly, demonstrated through your behavior and interactions.</p><h3> Once you have established a relationship: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. The quality and impact of your work. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. The depth of the relationships you build. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. By helping both the institution and the client executives you are working with </strong> &mdash;by adding multiple layers of value (core, personal, surprise).</p><p> <strong>  4. By the way in which you manage the client relationship. </strong> What kind of an experience do you create for the client? How much transparency is there? What is frequency and quality of interactions? Have you used technology to better connect with the client and create ongoing knowledge transfer?</p><p> <strong>  5.

She&rsquo;s not ready for that kind of exposure.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Not all exposure is good exposure. What if he says something stupid?&rdquo;</p><p> These are just a few of the reasons managers give for keeping their employees in the background doing the heavy lifting, while they present the results and negotiate the political landscape. Of course, from one perspective that makes a lot of sense. It&rsquo;s more efficient to have the workers doing the work, and let the managers explain it. But there&rsquo;s also much lost in such division of labor.</p><p> When a manager serves as an Ambassador, they know that true advocacy also involves teaching their team how to position the work that they do.</p><h3> 6 Reasons to Give Your Team More Upward Exposure <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  The Spotlight Will Show Up When You Least Expect It </strong> <br/> Perhaps the most pragmatic reason to get your team comfortable speaking at the next level is that someday, you won&rsquo;t be around and they&rsquo;ll need to. Some exec will start asking questions as they poke about, and if your employee&rsquo;s not prepared, he&rsquo;ll likely stick his foot in his mouth.</li><li> <strong>  It&rsquo;s the Best Way to Understand the Bigger Picture </strong> <br/> No matter how many times you explain &ldquo;why&rdquo; you are asking your team to do something, somehow when your boss says it, the lightbulbs go off. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve heard my managers say, &ldquo;You know I said that exact thing, but when you said it, they listened.&rdquo; Sure it&rsquo;s frustrating. But the point isn&rsquo;t who gets credit for getting through&ndash;the point is getting through.</li><li> <strong>  They&rsquo;ll Learn By Watching You </strong> <br/> Bringing your employees along gives them a great chance to watch you in a more senior environment. They&rsquo;ll learn more from watching than anything you could tell them.</li><li> <strong>  They&rsquo;ll Learn By Watching Your Boss </strong> <br/> I&rsquo;ll never forget the first time I walked onto the C-level floor. The atmosphere was completely different than the scurry below. There was a calm intensity and standard protocol. Not easy to explain. The only way I learned to swim in those waters was to watch the bigger fish.</li><li> <strong>  The Preparation Is Great Development </strong> <br/> The conversation you have while preparing for, and debriefing, the session is full of opportunities for growth and connection.</li><li> <strong>  It Takes Time to Build a Brand </strong> <br/> Don&rsquo;t wait until Jane is perfectly ready to be promoted until you start talking up her accomplishments and skills. A slow and steady trickle of positive exposure will lay a strong foundation when it&rsquo;s time to throw her hat in the ring. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s natural to want to protect your team until their completely ready for higher level exposure. Don&rsquo;t throw them into the spotlight under-prepared, but regular exposure to higher level people and strategy will go a long way in accelerating their development.</p><h3> Your turn.

{"original_id":3558,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Comfortable With Risk?","link":"are-you-comfortable-with-risk","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In the world of investment, winning and losing has much to do with the concept of risk. </p><p> In fact, in my experience, the best investors are those who look at investing as an art, rather than a science. The tools they rely on most are common sense and experience. </p><p> What I was most intrigued by in the book, &ldquo;Top Dog: The Science of Winning and Losing,&rdquo; by Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman, is the discussion of whether individuals are wired to win or lose&mdash;and how this affects innovation and responses to setbacks.</p><p> <strong>  From a financial planning point of view, here&rsquo;s how I believe people&rsquo;s perspective on winning and losing relates to saving for retirement: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Understand the psychology of investing. </strong>  The proliferation of the 24-hour news cycle has transformed and simplified our acknowledgment of the investment portfolio. It&rsquo;s easy to think that mutual funds or stocks are either green with life (when they are up), or red with death (when they are down). When you&rsquo;re investing, it&rsquo;s important to look at the big picture.</li><li> <strong>  Beware of the drama in the language of investing. </strong>  On a good day, we hear that the market &ldquo;soared.&rdquo; On a bad day, the market &ldquo;plunged.&rdquo; The language describing stock market activity can send the most fainthearted on an emotional roller coaster. Sometimes my clients think they are losing money, when in fact their investment portfolios have actually made money!</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t view investing as binary. </strong>  Your investment portfolio yields a numerical value that is only one part of assessing a person&rsquo;s overall holistic well-being, which includes financial health, spiritual health, emotional health, physical health, and mental health.</li><li> <strong>  Consider the principles of   <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    behavioral finance   </u>   .  </a> </strong>  This is a field that proposes psychology-based theories to explain stock market anomalies. Within behavioral finance, it is assumed that the information structure and the characteristics of market participants systematically influence individuals&rsquo; investment decisions as well as market outcomes.</li><li> <strong>  Demand purposeful solutions. </strong>  When working with my clients, I propose a series of options and strategies that show my clients the good, the bad, and the ugly. Specifically, I don&rsquo;t select only the funds that return the most if I don&rsquo;t think my clients have a willingness and ability to withstand risk, or the emotional fortitude to stay the course. And I don&rsquo;t select only the funds that haven&rsquo;t lost money, because there is no guarantee that will continue to be the case in the future.</li><li> <strong>  Analysis is key. </strong>  As one my clients eloquently stated, &ldquo;Every company has great online tools and resources. In fact, many of them are free. What I value is how you take the time to ask me both the qualitative and quantitative questions that provide me with context. With this context, I certainly feel more confident about my personal finances.&rdquo; Look for the same in your financial planner. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Now let&rsquo;s talk about risk. </strong></p><p> Each individual shows diverging competitive styles at different stages of life. Traditional views hold that the level of risk tolerance flattens out as people approach later stages of life. </p><p> Bronson and Merryman explain this in &ldquo;Top Dog,&rdquo; pointing to a 2011 study in  <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/pag/index.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   the journal Psychology and Aging  </u>  . </a>  The study found that people tend to become more competitive until about age 50, when their competitive fire gradually begins to cool. </p><p> In this sense, as individual investors gain more experience with investing or other forms of competition throughout the course of their lives, they may develop a heightened sense of confidence about their financial decisions. Experience and intuition, however, are not always reliable: they need to be constantly monitored and adjusted to ensure consistency with one&rsquo;s life financial goals. </p><p> <strong>  Fundamental differences between men and women affect their investing approach. </strong></p><p> Countless studies have shown what we all know: Women are more comfortable with taking risks only when they are reasonably sure about the chance of winning; while men seem to enjoy competing against all odds. </p><p> I have seen this phenomenon in my office when some couples seek financial planning and investment advice. Sometimes the views of the individuals in the couple are so divergent that the couple needs an intermediary to help them reach a consensus toward their goals and strategies. </p><p> For a couple to get the best financial advice possible, the individuals in the couple need to know themselves and each other well, and be able to communicate well with each other before seeking financial advice from a third-party.</p><p> <strong>  When it comes to financial planning, keep this in mind: </strong></p><p> 1. <strong>   Volatility in the financial markets has been unprecedented </strong>  over the past few years following the global financial crisis. Notably, the S&amp;P 500 index finished flat in 2011. If you invested in the in the S&amp;P 500 through an exchanged traded fund or index fund, would you call yourself a winner or a loser? </p><p> 2.  <strong>  Investors may be conditioned to think that they are only winners if they consistently select funds that increase in value. </strong>  In working with my clients, because financial planning is the foundation of our relationship, clients are not as focused on performance numbers, but stay focused on their progress towards their life goals. This is the only constant we can control&mdash;our own view of where we stand in relation to our definition of winning and losing. </p><p> 3.  <strong>  Remember, investment planning in isolation does not constitute financial planning. </strong>  Without a clear link between your investments and goals, it&rsquo;s easy to have trouble distinguishing the forest from the trees. Financial planning helps you understand the impact that each financial decision has on other areas of your financial life. </p><p> 4.  <strong>  Financial planning is about controlling spending, managing credit, reducing taxes, increasing savings, protecting family and assets, and building wealth for the future. </strong>  This process entails gathering financial information, establishing life goals, evaluating your current financial status, and developing a strategy to help you achieve your life goals. </p><p> 5. <strong>   Developing a strategy is critical, but monitoring the strategy is equally important. </strong>  Be sure to monitor your progress toward your goals. Even if your goals have not changed, the world around you may have changed. For example, laws on tax deductions and credits change, and so do retirement plan contribution limits and interest rates.</p><p> <strong>  The Bottom Line </strong></p><p> In my mind, we are all winners when we set goals, develop a plan to reach goals, implement the plan, and properly monitor our progress toward goals. </p><p> I don&rsquo;t agree with the perspective in the song  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/abba/the%2Bwinner%2Btakes%2Bit%2Ball_20002664.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   by ABBA  </a> </u>  that says, &ldquo;The winner takes it all, the loser standing small.&rdquo; To me, these lyrics reinforce the notion that life is all about winning and losing. </p><p> If your investment decisions are part of a strategic financial-planning process, then I firmly believe, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://ladygagadaily.tumblr.com/post/17755751513/sometimes-in-life-you-dont-always-feel-like-a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lady Gaga  </a> </u>  sings, that: &ldquo;Sometimes in life you don&rsquo;t always feel like a winner, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not a winner.&rdquo;</p><p> I tell my clients and followers that if their investment portfolio funds their children&rsquo;s education, their family vacations, and their retirement&mdash;then they are certainly winners in my book.</p><p> This post originally appeared in Inkandescent Magazine.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-07 19:41:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-07 19:41:38.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-comfortable-with-risk/\", \"post_id\": \"7890\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-07 19:41:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-07 19:41:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-comfortable-with-risk\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7888\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3679\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Give-Your-Team-Upward-Exposure-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"607\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449594000,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}

In dealing with these issues, organizations have to recognize that they are related.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hrbartender.com/2014/training/companies-cant-engage-employees-that-dont-stay/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   We can&rsquo;t engage employees that don&rsquo;t stay  </a> </u>  and employees won&rsquo;t stay if they&rsquo;re not engaged. So in developing our employee retention strategy, we have to look for those tools and solutions that we help us accomplish both.</p><h3> Technology is one of those things.</h3><p> <br/> Many organizations use technology to recruit. Even if all you&rsquo;re doing is posting jobs on LinkedIn, you&rsquo;re using technology. Employees have a level of expectation that they will use technology at work. It could be in onboarding paperwork, employee self-service, or performance management. Employees are comfortable with technology in their work.</p><p> That doesn&rsquo;t mean that technology is a replacement for human interaction. We still need face-to-face conversation. For example, it&rsquo;s probably not  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hrbartender.com/2015/recruiting/prevent-exit-interviews-with-stay-interviews/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a good thing to do a stay interview  </a> </u>  online. The goal is to find out how to keep an employee engaged so you can retain them. It could send a mixed message to do that via an online survey.</p><p> But organizations could use technology to keep track of who has conducted stay interviews or record notes of the interview to possibly spot trends that need to be addressed. Technology solutions don&rsquo;t have to be the entire process. They can be a very effective step in the process.</p><p> Technology also allows organizations to be in multiple places at the same time. Many organizations are realizing that engagement (and ultimately retention) start with the hiring process and the candidate experience. But the days of  <u>  <a href=\"http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/tools-stop-recruiters-spraying-praying/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   spray and pray recruiting  </a> </u>  are over. We must be more strategic in our employee retention strategy. That&rsquo;s where technology comes in.</p><p> Career portals, talent networks, social sharing and recruitment marketing are all technology solutions and tools that allow companies to tailor their message and direct candidates to the right information. Technology allows us to control the message so the candidate knows exactly what to expect before they ever apply.</p><p> Getting our arms around what technology can do for our business isn&rsquo;t easy. There are many technology solutions available. We have to understand what we are trying to accomplish, so we choose the solution that meets our needs. This really came into focus for me recently when I was having some challenges with my internet browser, Google Chrome. I was getting increasingly frustrated with it so I decided I was going to switch to Internet Explorer. I know, I know &ndash; Internet Explorer?! &hellip;but I was really frustrated. So I spent days moving all my bookmarks, etc.</p><p> As soon as I did it, I immediately regretted it. I missed my Chrome extensions, etc. That was when I realized,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hrbartender.com/2014/training/becoming-an-effective-adopter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I didn&rsquo;t have to choose  </a> </u> . I was getting frustrated over nothing. I can have a primary and secondary browser. Voila! Problem fixed.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the same with other forms of technology. We don&rsquo;t have to choose one program or platform. That&rsquo;s what makes technology so great. If we let it, we can increase our effectiveness by letting technology be a part of our employee retention strategy. There&rsquo;s no one way to engage employees. We need to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hrbartender.com/2015/recruiting/aligning-hr-technology-with-your-talent-decisions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   let technology help us  </a> </u> . Just be smart about the role it plays.</p><h3> Let technology do what it does best.

{"original_id":3560,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Should You Take Social Security at 62?","link":"should-you-take-social-security-at-62","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The majority of eligible filers do in fact file for social security benefits prior to \"full retirement age\" (FRA), which is age 66 for most filers. Approximately 40% of filers take their benefits at age 62 and 75% take their benefits prior to full retirement age.</h3><p> <br/> Frankly, the majority of early fillers do so because they have little choice; they need the money. However, a large percentage, who would otherwise have the option to delay the start of benefits, do so having given little thought to the opportunity costs of filing early. In fact, many early filers later regret their decision once they learn of the financial repercussions of filing early. <br/> <br/> By filing early, you permanently reduce your benefit amount by 25% as compared to your eligible benefit amount at age 66. Furthermore, you also miss an opportunity to increase your benefit amount by 8% per year by further delaying the start of your benefits from FRA to age 70. These represent permanent lifetime increases in your benefits. Delaying the start of benefits can also increase the size of all future cost of living adjustments (COLA) since these COLA adjustments will apply to your now higher benefit amount. <br/> <br/> It is true that delaying the start of your benefits means that it will take some time in order to \"recoup\" the benefits that you could have obtained by filing earlier. From my experience, however, most break-even points range from age 78-81. So, if you think you are likely to live beyond that age range then you may be better off deferring the start of your benefits. <br/> <br/> From a financial planning perspective, it is often more important to treat social security benefits  as \"insurance\" versus an \"investment\". In other words, since social security is a pension (it will pay you as long as you live), it is an invaluable retirement asset that can protect you from \"longevity risk\"; the risk of outliving your money. Given that social security provides for COLA, it is a powerful tool in addressing potentially higher cost of living expenses later in retirement such as health care costs and long-term care expenses. <br/> <br/> Another disadvantage to filing for benefits prior to FRA results from the \"earnings test \". If you file for social security prior to FRA and you are still working, if you earn over $15,720 per year, social security will claw back $1 of benefits for every $2 in earnings above $15,720. In the year you turn 66, social security will allow you to earn $41,880 but will claw back $1 of benefits for every $3 you earn above that amount. Any benefits that are clawed back will be included in the recalculation of your benefit amount at FRA.  The point being that filing early when you are still working may result in some or all of your benefits being clawed back. <br/> <br/> Another disadvantage to filing early is that, by doing so, you are also reducing the survivor benefit for your spouse. If your own benefit is higher than your spouse's benefit then, assuming you pre-decrease your spouse, she will be eligible to switch from her lower benefit to your higher benefit amount at your death.  Conversely, if your spouse pre-deceases you, then you would simply continue to receive your own higher benefit. By filing early you may be significantly reducing this survivor benefit. <br/> <br/> When deciding whether to start benefits early or not, numerous other factors should be considered including your life expectancy, health status, other retirement assets, how low you plan to work, your spouses benefit amount (if any), divorced spouse benefits (if any), survivor benefits (if any), etc. <br/> <br/> In addition to those factors, you now also have to consider the impact of the \"new social rules\" and \"upcoming deadlines\" resulting from the recent Bipartisan Budget Bill. In navigating your way through this complex decision making process it would be prudent to engage the assistance of a financial advisor who specializes in social security and retirement income planning. You may have an opportunity to obtain tens of thousands of dollars (even hundreds of thousands of dollars) of additional lifetime benefits from social security. Do your homework and make sure you are not unnecessarily leaving money on the table by filing for social security benefits too early.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 14:54:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 14:54:09.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/should-you-take-social-security-at-62/\", \"post_id\": \"7893\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 14:54:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 14:54:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"should-you-take-social-security-at-62\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7891\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3682\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/employee-technology.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"813\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449657900,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3561,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Financial Planning and Wealth Management Needs for Cross Border Professionals","link":"the-financial-planning-and-wealth-management-needs-for-cross-border-professionals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This is the second article in our series of industry content from Maxim Global Wealth Advisors, designed to help financial professionals better understand the opportunities available in the cross-border financial planning marketplace.In our <a href=\"/advisor/the-growing-opportunity-in-cross-border-wealth-management-for-independent-financial-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   first article  </u> </a> , we detailed the size, scope and characteristics of the cross border wealth management niche, which is estimated to be over $6 trillion.</p><h3> Globalization is driving the growth of a large and underserved market niche for wealth management, known collectively as Cross Border Families, which is comprised of the following three sub-groups:</h3><li> International professionals living in the U.S.</li><li> American expats</li><li> International families with assets in the U.S.</li>These individuals and families have specialized needs and are subject to numerous and complex tax, legal, currency and planning issues.   Their specific financial planning and wealth management needs consist of the following.<h3> Cross Border Professionals</h3>Foreign-born professionals living in the U.S., such as a high tech engineer from India working for a U.S. technology company.   These are foreign-born individuals who are well educated and work in a professional capacity in the United States.This demographic generally has more complicated financial affairs than a typical American. They tend to be accomplished high-income professionals, and they also save at a considerably higher rate than their American peers.  As a result, their planning and investing needs are more complex.  These investors struggle with understanding our unique tax code, along with the various retirement and investment options offered to them here in the U.S.Most have very little experience with investing as many foreign countries have much less developed and readily accessible investment markets. Further, there are very few financial institutions or advisors that are qualified to help them.  This group generally feels very alone and overwhelmed when it comes to investment and retirement decisions, even though they save a much higher share of their income and thus have fairly secure retirement outlooks.<h3> Americans Living Abroad</h3>Among American expats, there is a considerable amount of confusion surrounding personal finances and retirement. Much of this revolves around U.S. taxes and how it integrates with whatever foreign tax they pay in their resident country.   As a result, they too have very complex financial planning and investing needs.Effective retirement readiness planning and investment management are major challenges, as there are very few places to turn for answers or advice. Also, self-managing one&rsquo;s accounts back in the U.S. can be very difficult, given the administrative red tape and because many U.S. financial institutions would rather not take the risk of serving expats.   Many brokerages and banks are systematically closing accounts with a foreign address.Likewise, most foreign financial institutions are also not disposed to serve American expats, with the cause being compliance with the far-reaching information sharing requirements of FATCA regulations.  As a result, this group is also facing very few options.<h3> Non-Resident Aliens</h3>Foreign citizens living outside the U.S., with no U.S. citizenship or residency, but with U.S. based financial assets.A large percentage of this segment are foreign professionals who previously worked in the U.S. and accumulated certain financial assets that remain there even after they&rsquo;ve left the U.S., such as real estate, bank and brokerage accounts, 401k and other qualified assets. Additionally, foreign citizens who have inherited various financial assets in the U.S. and have chosen to leave those accounts in the U.S is also contributing to the growth of this segment.It is becoming very common for high-net-worth (HNW) international families to purchase U.S. real estate, either as an investment or to establish a stronger connection to the U.S. for their families.This group also has fairly substantial and complex wealth management needs.  However, the primary opportunity with these investors is to provide oversight of their qualified and non-qualified investment portfolios in the U.S., which would be nearly impossible to self-direct for a non-resident alien living abroad.<h3> <strong>  Primary Financial Planning and Wealth Management Needs </strong></h3>For these growing niche segments, their primary financial and investment planning needs consist of several specific service requirements.  Beginning with investment management, cross border investors need specialized investment portfolio management that takes into consideration their specific situation. This includes establishing and funding brokerage accounts, investment portfolio construction and ongoing monitoring.Additionally, many of these investors require specialized financial planning and wealth advisory services, delivered through a personal relationship with a knowledgeable financial advisor. Key areas of focus are:<li> Personal risk tolerance</li><li> Overall balance sheet review and asset allocation</li><li> Stock option and equity compensation analysis</li><li> Tax strategies and optimization of investment portfolios to maximize tax efficiency</li><li> Retirement readiness and financial projections</li><li> Review of real estate and other alternative assets</li><li> Advanced retirement planning related to: estate planning, asset protection and insurance, charitable giving, and more.</li>Because of the complexities involved, cross border investors also require advanced and specialized client service and administrative support.  Examples include assisting in the movement of funds, management of various investment accounts, as well as handholding in the process of opening new accounts, transferring assets and executing foreign currency transactions.  Other general service items can be complicated by foreign addresses and the lack of U.S. citizenship, thus a dedicated and specialized technology and service platform is necessary.Finally, rounding out the wealth management needs includes introducing clients to other qualified professionals when required, such as tax, legal, immigration, HR, and others.In our next few articles, we&rsquo;ll highlight a specific cross border individual story and how a cross border wealth management approach solved their challenges.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 15:03:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 15:03:14.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-financial-planning-and-wealth-management-needs-for-cross-border-professionals/\", \"post_id\": \"7895\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 15:03:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 15:03:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-financial-planning-and-wealth-management-needs-for-cross-border-professionals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7894\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3683\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cross-border-professionals_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1068\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449693000,"author_id":31,"chart_url":""}

Sometimes they are seen as a waste of time because not a lot gets accomplished. They may be considered boring, time consuming and sometimes emotions take over when disagreements come up. As a mentor and coach to business owners I insist that partners meet on a regular schedule and also with their teams.</p><p> Partners who do not have regular ongoing scheduled meetings to clarify, plan and strategize are jeopardizing their very partnership and the business. What I know as a fact, when partners and departments within a business don&rsquo;t talk to each other, at the very least, misunderstandings and false assumptions abound, ill feelings begin to fester, the business does not function as well as it could and for certain,  money is left on the table.  Eventually I may get the call to rescue a dying partnership relationship.</p><p> Tad and Jonathan were ready to quit when they called me. Each accused the other of not fulfilling the tasks they were obligated to do.  They barely remembered the last time they met to discuss the business. Each focused on whatever he thought he should and viewed the other as the problem when things didn&rsquo;t work.</p><p> It was mind boggling to hear the differences in perception of where they were and where they were going. As they worked separately without consulting each other, the space between them was widening.</p><p> In  facilitating the difficult conversation between them the first thing I taught them was how to listen to each other. They were grateful and amazed that they could have a conversation that left out the emotions.</p><p> Next they came to the realization that their basic original desires and dreams for this business were still the same and they actually still liked each other. It became clear that the resentment that each of them was harboring about the other was the result of not communicating. Although each was doing what he thought he should, they were on separate paths. Tad was in charge of finances and the IT department. Managers of the various teams, design, production, marketing and fulfillment reported directly to Jonathan. But even the team managers didn&rsquo;t meet and nowhere was the infrastructure to discuss how everything fit into the big picture of the original vision and mission the partners had planned.</p><h3> One of the greatest advantages of having a partner was ignored; having someone to share responsibility, brainstorm new ideas, and ongoing evaluations about what is working and what isn&rsquo;t.</h3><p> <br/> Regular meetings with tight and useful agenda items keep the work of the business on track with the parts fitting together like a well-oiled machine the effects of which show up in a growing bottom line.</p><p> Overcome your habit of avoiding meetings and build in meaningful schedules to talk about the big picture and the details at least once a week.</p><p> You have made a major investment of time, maybe money and your dream.

It&rsquo;s also a time to look ahead, for yourself and your firm.</p><p> In our coaching experience through the years, December is an opportunity for you to plot the course for the future of your practice.</p><p> There are many key areas that need your attention. We put together a year-end checklist, with templates you should download, to help you plan for intentional success and stay on track.</p><h3> Set Goals</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m a big advocate of setting goals because they inspire, stretch, engage, and provide purpose to an organization.</p><p> Setting goals provides you with long-term vision, short-term motivation, and a means to identify what is important. It helps you organize your time and resources so that you can be more productive and develop new skills required to achieve each goal.</p><p> Ensure your goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time based.</p><p> Specific:</p><p> Identify specific goals by answering the following questions:</p><li> Who is involved?</li><li> What do I want to accomplish?</li><li> Where will the goal process take place?</li><li> When will the goal start and end?</li><li> Which requirements are needed to complete the goal and which challenges may occur?</li><li> Why do I want to achieve this goal? (purpose and benefits of accomplishment) <br/>  </li><p> By establishing a specific goal rather than a general goal, you create a bond with your goal. The goal now embodies meaning, challenge, and reward along with a much greater chance of accomplishment.</p><h3> Measurable:</h3><p> Create a measurement system for your goal by establishing periodic checkpoints to measure progress toward reaching each goal you set. Measuring progress helps you stay on track by meeting deadlines and target dates. Ask yourself questions to identify your progress such as: How much?, How many?, and How will I know when my goal is accomplished?</p><h3> Attainable:</h3><p> Attainable goals are reached when you link importance and achievement together. After identifying your most important goals and the success of achieving each goal, you will find ways to develop the attitude, skills, and ability to reach them. By instilling these characteristics you will create a new vision and desire to attain goals previously overlooked.</p><h3> Realistic:</h3><p> Shooting for the moon can be realistic as long as you make a commitment to reach your goal. Making a commitment leaves no room for excuses. Identify a realistic goal by asking yourself: &ldquo;What conditions need to be present for me to attain this goal?&rdquo;</p><h3> Timely:</h3><p> &ldquo;Sometime&rdquo; and &ldquo;someday&rdquo; will not allow you to reach your goal. Solidify your goal planning by establishing a time frame with specific dates. I like to use a timeline with each of my goals which also aides in progress measurement.</p><h3> Your Assignment:</h3><p> <br/> Download  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/product/ironstone-goal-planning-poster/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ironstone&rsquo;s Goal Planning Poster </a>  to start setting, assigning, and tracking your goals.

These scenarios are detrimental to any company. Marketing plans are essential to provide direction towards your goals and firm growth. Without growth and a plan to get there, your firm is at risk to silently fade away.</p><p> Advisors face common challenges when it comes to marketing. Many cite that time, talent, and the implementation of written plans are their top concerns. These elements are critical to your long-term success and the absence of any component reduces your marketing efforts significantly.  In addition, marketers need to develop and implement strategies to address communal growth dilemmas facing advisors to overcome investor perception.</p><h3> Your Assignment:</h3><p> <br/> Download the  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/product/essential-guide-to-financial-advisor-marketing-complete-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Essential Guide to Financial Advisor Marketing </a>  to help you identify marketing components that are vital to a successful marketing plan.

One of the focus areas analyzed was the effectiveness of creating ideal client profile definitions.</p><p> The study found that firms with a formal ideal client definition have greater success in attracting clients that meet specific criteria and they are less likely to accept clients who are not profitable for the firm. Firms without a clear definition tend to accept clients that don&rsquo;t meet entry point minimums and, in general, are not suitable for the firm.</p><h3> Your Assignment:</h3><p> <br/> Download our  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/product/create-an-ideal-client-profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Create an Ideal Client Profile </a>  workbook to review a series of key questions you must ask to determine who your ideal client is.</p><h3> Create Your Unique Value Proposition</h3><p> <br/> Do you have a defined clear answer that inspires questions?

{"original_id":3565,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Reasons Why to Focus On The Negative","link":"10-reasons-why-to-focus-on-the-negative","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Think positive,&rdquo; is the call coming from coaches. &ldquo;Just let the negative thoughts float away,&rdquo; a phrase many a Yoga instructor has uttered. It has been my observation that these well-intended recommendations simply fall way short for many people. They&rsquo;re just impossible to carry out. Sure, on the surface many people who claim to be enlightened seem to peaceful, loving folk. And I don&rsquo;t doubt that their behavior matches that. However, what goes on in their head, your head, yes, my head is likely very different.</p><p> And I would like to dig even a little deeper, beyond the thoughts that cross our brain. Consider the ones that never make their way to the level of our awareness; the so-called subconscious? Those are the ones that I believe control our lives in ways of which we have no idea.</p><p> For those of you unfamiliar with my work, here is the short version of how I believe our brain operates. The predominant brain is what I have called the Automatic Brain, or AB. The AB is primitive, animalistic, highly reactive, and on autopilot. Its only function is to protect us from danger, threat, or vulnerability. The way it does that is by storing information; most actively between birth and adolescence. When our experience matches stored information that indicates potential danger, the AB causes us to fight or flee. Because our AB is more highly evolved than other animals, we are capable of having thoughts, which are part of the fight-or-flight reaction caused by this brain&mdash;arising from the reaction itself, as well as helping to perpetuate it (for our &ldquo;safety&rdquo;, of course).</p><h3> <strong>  Here are 10 reasons why and how to focus on the negative. First the why: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. It&rsquo;s running the show whether you like it or not</h3><p> Much of the information stored by the AB is sitting deep in its memory banks, well below our level of awareness. Nevertheless, the AB is actively referencing it against our experiences. The fight-or-flight stored in our memory banks can be in the form of emotions generated by thoughts. The most prominent is anger, even rage. You see, anger is the ultimate fight response and often originates from any circumstance where we perceive being &ldquo;one-upped&rdquo; or have lost the security of being loved.  These are tucked away neatly in the danger memory banks of the AB. To the AB everything holds the possibility of danger, therefore it refers back to these memories all the time, yet we are unaware.</p><h3> 2. Being positive, thinking good thoughts, happiness it&rsquo;s all dangerous</h3><p> &ldquo;How absurd,&rdquo; you say?  Not really to the AB. It turns out the AB is concerned about only one thing&mdash;to keep us safe. Having a Pollyanna attitude can leave us unprotected, guard down, vulnerable to attack. Those subconscious emotions are a good place to go in order to distract us from such &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; places and that&rsquo;s precisely what happens.</p><h3> 3. The subconscious is at the root of many physical and mental illnesses</h3><p> As you proceed in life, danger abounds; usually not real danger, but as long as the possibility of it exists, your AB will go into action. The negative emotions/thoughts stored in the danger memory banks can cause you to fight or flee even situations in which you wish to be. The resultant electrochemical reaction can cause a slew of physical and psychological problems.</p><h3> 4. The negative emotions themselves can represent danger</h3><p> Since our AB is storing information from childhood, it has a lot of crazy stuff in there. Additionally, other life experience may have caused emotions, as anger toward a particular person, and facing the anger leads to much guilt. Unfortunately, since our AB does not think and only reacts, just because we suppress these feelings, it still uses them to &ldquo;keep us safe&rdquo;.</p><h3> 5. We can never know positive if it were not for the negative</h3><p> Everyone has a story and every story has its share of negative. We must be aware that our AB&rsquo;s default is to the negative as the negative is what eventually can hurt us. In fact, it is this negative that allows us to have some perspective on the meaning of positive.</p><h3> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s the how to effectively focus on the negative: </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  6. Meditate on past persons, places, or things that caused, or still cause, you anger and rage. </strong></p><p> <strong>  7. Write them down in explicit detail; mainly why they cause such anger. </strong></p><p> <strong>  8. Understand that this exercise is not to be unforgiving or confrontational. It is to diffuse the power of these subconscious emotions, not relive them. Keep what you find to yourself until they no longer cause a reaction. </strong></p><p> <strong>  9. As you bring them up to the level of awareness, you will begin to see how they play a role in your everyday circumstances&mdash;from your relationships at home, to those in the workplace, to your feelings about yourself and perhaps your own inadequacies. </strong></p><p> <strong>  10. The more detailed you can be, the more freedom you will feel.   </strong></p><p> When you bring these negative emotions up to the level of awareness and consciousness, you begin to open the access door to your Mind, the gateway to our Divine nature, where there exists a peace that seems impossible for our mortal brains to comprehend.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 17:10:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 17:10:01.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-reasons-why-to-focus-on-the-negative/\", \"post_id\": \"7903\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 17:10:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 17:10:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-reasons-why-to-focus-on-the-negative\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7902\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3687\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/focus-on-the-negative.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"474\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449658800,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

They are always part of something bigger&mdash;as in your entire business and revenue model.</p><p> Take &ldquo;Victor&rdquo;. Three years into his consulting business serving corporate clients he was making low six-figures. His revenue model was simple: charging hourly and project rates for his services. But his system was entirely based on time&mdash;he charged the same whether his work resulted in huge savings for the client or modest incremental changes.</p><p> Time for a tweak.</p><p> Victor had become quite adept at knowing which projects had high potential for earth-moving results for his clients. So he agreed to try just one small change.</p><p> The next high-potential client appearing on his radar got a new proposal&mdash;one that was value-based and explicitly showed the client the value of the work vs simply the steps to get there. He created three pricing options, all linked to specific results and BASED ON VALUE, not time.</p><p> First client out of the chute bought the high-end option, which brought Victor <strong>   three times his old hours-based fee. </strong>  Which the client was happy to pay because it was so clearly linked to results.</p><p> Happy client, thrilled consultant.</p><p> Now it&rsquo;s your turn.</p><p> Here are a few suggestions from tweaking to downright overhaul:</p><p> <strong>  Hike your hourly or retainer fees at least annually. </strong>  You may prefer working on an hourly basis, especially if your work is time-intensive and challenging to scope properly. If you continually serve the same clients, you&rsquo;ll often feel limited to small cost-of-living bumps. But let me encourage you to push that envelope. There is often far more room than you think to adjust your rates. And if you have clients that no longer fit or who are highly challenging? You can raise your rates more aggressively to reflect your sweet-spot and the others will start dropping away over time.</p><p> <strong>  Introduce project fees. </strong>  Most clients prefer project fees&mdash;they know going in what it&rsquo;s going to cost and it gives them some comfort and sense of control. The key is not to base your project fee just on time, or it becomes an even bigger trap than hourly fees. Try a Victor&mdash;especially with a new client who has no other frame of reference with you BUT the value that you show you can achieve for them.</p><p> <strong>  Results billing. </strong>  This is when you can really create deep bonds with your clients. With a few noted exceptions (think consultants doing large-scale cost-savings projects), billing linked to specific results requires mutual trust and an open, candid working relationship between peers. In my own business, I have a handful of relationships where I represent clients for speaking engagements and high-impact consulting gigs. I don&rsquo;t charge up front, but take a fee on business that we close. Essentially, I&rsquo;m working on spec&mdash;so I only consider that with someone I know well, whose work is ready for that scale and who I trust implicitly to do the right thing. And yes, I do have a horror story&mdash;but only one over many years of consulting. Acceptable risk, don&rsquo;t you think?</p><p> <strong>  Examples: linking all or a portion of your fees to a percentage of savings/revenue increases; establishing progress fees related to specific client milestones; taking a percentage of a defined goal. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Profit-sharing and/or ownership interest. </strong>  This is rarified territory and yet there are possibilities here to really stretch your revenue. The key&mdash;like with results billing&mdash;is deep trust on both sides of the equation. And your advice has to have a direct, visible impact on your client&rsquo;s bottom line or you&rsquo;re both wasting time with this approach. Word to the wise: if you feel the necessity to have a 20-page document outlining how this works in all situations&mdash;walk away. This approach is not for you.</p><p> <strong>  Examples: your fees include a percentage of the profit (net after expenses); you take an ownership interest in return for reduced fees. </strong></p><p> These are just a few ways you can work within your existing fee structure to better leverage the time and energy you&rsquo;re spending with your clients.</p><p> For an even deeper exercise, you&rsquo;ll want to look at ALL aspects of your business and revenue model&mdash;including leveraging through employees or contractors; developing books and products; and creating multiple options and price points for your niche audiences.</p><p> More on that in a later post.</p><p> In the meantime, please take a good hard look at how you&rsquo;re billing. Are you being properly compensated for the value you add to your clients?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 19:48:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 19:48:18.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/raising-your-consulting-fees/\", \"post_id\": \"7905\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 19:48:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 19:48:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"raising-your-consulting-fees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7904\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3688\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Raising-Your-Consulting-Fees-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"401\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-does-it-mean-to-be-extremely-productive\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"What Does It Mean to Be Extremely Productive?\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449684000,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}

People have already expressed concern about  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.iinet.net.au/protecting-your-privacy/#sthash.aPvOXPE3.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   security aspects  </a> </u>  of the facial biometrics database and a  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/10/12/australia-meta-data-problems/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds#F_cJJvEkRiqT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   metadata database of Internet users  </a> </u> , which started this fall.</p><p> &ldquo;The idea of a cloud passport would of course be grounded in absolute security,&rdquo; Bishop told the press. Exactly how this &ldquo;absolute security&rdquo; would be attained, she didn&rsquo;t say. Australia also hasn&rsquo;t talked about the idea with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.itnews.com.au/news/australia-considering-passport-less-travel-411218#ixzz3sMChSsrd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   any countries other than New Zealand  </a> </u> , reports ITNews Australia.</p><p> &ldquo;The Government must also consider the privacy implications if Internet providers are to be compelled to collect data on Australians,&rdquo; writes Steve Dalby, chief regulatory officer for Internet provider IINet. &ldquo;The vast amount of data stored would prove to be an appealing target for hackers all around the world&mdash;creating a risk of information and identity theft in the event that storage of the data is breached.&rdquo; It could also be abused by law enforcement and considered a privacy violation, writes Bogle.</p><p> &ldquo;They might as well paint a bulls-eye on the server farm and hang a sign on it that says &lsquo;Please Hack Me,&rsquo;&rdquo; writes ValueWalk. &ldquo;In the black market, that kind of data is worth billions. And governments don&rsquo;t exactly have a sterling track record of tip-top network security.&rdquo; A recent report from the Australian Government&rsquo;s Cyber Security Centre said government cybersecurity incidents are up over 300 percent from 2011 to 2014, the organization writes, such as one incident that released the  <u>  <a href=\"http://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-security-proposal-raises-eyebrows-in-australia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   information about 10,000 refugees  </a> </u> .</p><p> Managing the database itself would also be a security issue, Intelligent Business Research Services infosec analyst James Turner tells ITNews Australia. &ldquo;The big questions around this database of identities will need to focus on data governance,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying. &ldquo;Who will be allowed to make changes, how are updates to records authorized, and all the way through, a comprehensive and reliable audit trail will need to be maintained, and protected to the same level as the cloud database.&rdquo;</p><p> Ironically, the system could also make work more difficult for law enforcement, because they would find it more difficult to create aliases themselves, according to Turner. &ldquo;Naturally, this cloud repository of identities will be of great interest to nation states keen on creating false identities for their spies,&rdquo; he tells ITNews. &ldquo;[The repository] would let a nation state validate if someone was actually who they claimed to be. This could make operations tricky for Australian spooks or undercover officers who want to work under an alias.&rdquo;</p><p> Eventually, though, the whole notion of &ldquo;Papers, please!&rdquo;&mdash;passports have been around for more than a hundred years&mdash;could become a thing of the past.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 19:48:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 19:48:47.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"post_id\": \"7907\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 19:48:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 19:48:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-paperless-passports-in-your-future\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7906\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3689\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/paperless-passport.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"737\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449676800,"author_id":339,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3568,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Sure You Want To Keep The Marital Home? Answer These Four Questions","link":"are-you-sure-you-want-to-keep-the-marital-home-answer-these-four-questions","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> If you&rsquo;re divorcing, you&rsquo;ve no doubt been asked &ldquo;Will you get to keep the house?&rdquo; It seems that in many divorces, the marital home can begin to feel like kind of a prize, something to fight for. It&rsquo;s almost as though there is an unspoken notion that the spouse who moves out appears in some ways to have &ldquo;lost.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Granted, the marital residence carries significant symbolic and cultural weight. After all, &ldquo;Home is where the heart is&rdquo; &ndash;or so we&rsquo;re told. In addition, for many couples, the marital home is their largest single asset. But does that mean the person who gets the house &ldquo;wins?&rdquo; Is there any financial truth to that idea?</p><p> Since both financial and emotional factors weighing heavily on the decision, handling the marital residence in divorce is an excellent opportunity to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thinkfinancially.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Think Financially, Not Emotionally&reg;  </a> </u> . As difficult as it may be at first, you need to make decisions about your home based on thoughtful analysis of the value and cost of retaining the property as an asset &ndash;not on emotions.</p><p> So, with your financial thinking cap on, here are four important questions to ask yourself in evaluating whether to keep your marital home:</p><h3> Can you afford the real cost of owning it &ndash; now, and in the future?</h3><p> There&rsquo;s much more to keeping the house than just getting to live there. Think carefully about what it will cost you to own the property, and whether you can sustain those costs while still ensuring your secure financial future. Your primary residence might be an impressive property with many enviable amenities. However, the larger your home, the more truly expensive it is to own. Make sure you&rsquo;ve considered:</p><li> property taxes</li><li> homeowner&rsquo;s insurance</li><li> maintenance and repairs</li><li> improvements</li><li> furnishing <br/>  </li><p> None of these will get less expensive over time, and the older your house gets, the more maintenance and repair it will need. It&rsquo;s easy to want a house with a new roof, sparkling swimming pool, and top-notch appliances, but project yourself ten or twenty years into the future. How might you feel about tackling those replacements?</p><p> If your income won&rsquo;t keep up with these demands on it, you may conclude that a more modest property would make better financial sense.</p><h3> Can you refinance the mortgage?</h3><p> If you are going to keep the house, your husband will almost certainly want his name off the mortgage; however,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-a-divorce-how-one-spouse-can-keep-the-house-1415206299\" target=\"_blank\">   refinancing the mortgage  </a> </u>  in your name alone presents its own set of challenges. For starters, you will have to meet federal requirements concerning your debt-to-income ratio. While it&rsquo;s true that income from alimony or child support can be used to qualify for a mortgage, be mindful of this critical catch: It can only count as income after there&rsquo;s a documented history of those payments having been reliably received. Mortgage lenders know how often ex-husbands default on support payments, so they proceed with caution.</p><p> If a &ldquo;jumbo&rdquo; mortgage (defined as more than $417,000, in most markets) is involved, the hurdles are even higher.</p><h3> Can you sell it when you want to?</h3><p> Your home can be a tremendously valuable asset &ndash; but you&rsquo;ll only fully access that value if and when you sell it. In deciding whether the marital home is an asset you want to keep, consider what the housing market conditions are where the property is located.</p><p> Projections of future conditions are especially important &ndash; and no matter how rosy the outlook, there are no guarantees. How long do you expect to live in the house? What are the most reliable projections for housing market conditions in that time span? Can you live with the inherent uncertainty of even the best projections?</p><h3> Can you handle the tax implications?</h3><p> If you sell your house for more than you paid for it (plus any capital improvements), you may have a significant taxable capital gain, even after taking the $250,000 exclusion you&rsquo;re entitled to as a single woman. You&rsquo;ll need to pay both state and federal taxes on that gain, and those taxes are on the rise. The federal maximum was raised in 2013 from 15% to 23.5%, and there have been proposals in 2015 to raise it further, to 28%.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a simple example: Let&rsquo;s say you originally paid $200,000 for your house, which now has an appraised fair market value of $1,000,000, and you&rsquo;re going to sell it for that much. Your selling costs are 6% or $60,000. The $1,000,000 sales price minus $60,000 selling costs = $940,000.</p><p> Subtract from that your original purchase price: $940,000 &ndash; $200,000 = $740,000 profit.</p><p> Subtract the $250,000 tax exclusion you are allowed on the capital gain from sale of your primary residence: $740,000 &ndash; $250,000 = $490,000 in capital gain.</p><p> For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s assume your total capital gains tax rate is 20%. You will now owe the federal government 20% of $490,000, which is $98,000. If the capital gains tax rate increases to 28%, you&rsquo;ll owe $137,200. (And that doesn&rsquo;t include state capital gains tax!)</p><p> Work through the likely numbers for your own property, so that you&rsquo;ll know ahead of time what your capital gains tax hit is likely to be, and whether you can handle it.</p><p> If you approach the decision of whether to keep the marital home through the lens of critical questions like these, you might conclude that yes, you&rsquo;re in excellent shape to meet the challenges of hanging on to it, and that furthermore, it is what you really want to do with your money. However, it&rsquo;s also possible you&rsquo;ll realize that keeping the property isn&rsquo;t a wise move, financially. If that&rsquo;s the case, please don&rsquo;t think of giving up the marital residence as a loss. Instead, recognize it as an opportunity to move on to a secure future in a new home that will make excellent financial sense.</p><p> <strong>  Reminder:  </strong> Aside from the end of the marriage itself, there are few considerations more emotionally charged than leaving the home in which you were married and perhaps raised a family. I know it can be a difficult, wrenching decision. However, I urge you to put emotions aside and consider keeping the house to be a financial question. Should it make more sense to move, you can make your next house a lovely home as well &ndash; with the security of knowing it isn&rsquo;t risking your financial future to do so.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip:  </strong> If you&rsquo;re not sure what housing market conditions are in your area, consult a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-a-landers/the-three-key-players-eve_b_1303717.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   real estate appraiser  </a> </u> . You&rsquo;ll get a good understanding of the local market and the value of your home in that context.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters: </strong>  If you do opt to keep the marital residence as your own asset after your divorce, be sure to remove your ex-husband&rsquo;s name from all the legal documentation related to it. This may require a visit by your attorney to the Registry of Deeds, or the equivalent agency in your state.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 20:11:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 20:11:12.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-sure-you-want-to-keep-the-marital-home-answer-these-four-questions/\", \"post_id\": \"7908\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 20:11:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 20:11:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-sure-you-want-to-keep-the-marital-home-answer-these-four-questions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7906\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3690\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/paperless-passport.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"580\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449680400,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}

Companies, large and small, cannot survive without great leadership, sound strategy and flawless execution.</h3><p> <br/> Those that thrive go a step further; they breathe culture. And what, in a nutshell, is culture?</p><h3> Culture is meaningful work, well done.</h3><p> <br/> Indeed, there are plenty of sub-segments to the success factors I have identified. The untapped resource is the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;Average Joe.&rdquo; Average Joes are the majority of most work forces. Because they aren&rsquo;t categorized as whiz kids or water walkers, it&rsquo;s easy to take them for granted. Do not take them for granted. Applaud them. Nurture their talent. Listen to them. Take pleasure in watching the difference these unsung heroes can make.</p><p> In my years as a CEO, I had the pleasure of working with several unsung heroes. Here are the stories of five of them who worked with me at Jacobs Suchard:</p><p> <strong>  1.  Ronnie, a union employee </strong> , never missed the company Christmas party or the summer social event. Ronnie was an organizer &ndash; a leader in cultural development. He refused to be blocked by the rock wall that separates managements from unions. This guy took a sledge hammer to that wall and turned it to rubble.</p><p> <strong>  2.  Bruce, a Marketing Manager </strong> who struggled with detail, flourished as a creative resource. Bruce masterminded the sponsorship of a nation-wide charitable endeavor. When paraplegic athlete Rick Hansen returned to the shores of the Atlantic after wheeling around the world, Bruce&rsquo;s promotion increased our coffee sales by 3 share points &ndash; in hard cash, several million dollars in profit.</p><p> <strong>  3.  Gary, an ex-marine middle manager </strong> looked beyond conventional channels to drive our Toblerone Chocolate business. He identified the link between the brand&rsquo;s Swiss heritage and that of the restaurant chain, Swiss Chalet. Gary sold the idea of a free Toblerone with turkey meals. Sales increased by millions of bars . . . and the offer continued for 6 years.</p><p> <strong>  4.  Paul, a salesman </strong> , was the sales department&rsquo;s answer to Ronnie. Paul wore the company colors on and off the job. A CEO couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better soldier in the battlefield. Paul set the values example for every employee. He laughed a lot and made hard work fun. That&rsquo;s important, especially when a business or industry slips into an economic downturn.</p><p> <strong>  5.  Gail, an accounting clerk </strong> , inspired like no other. Each year, a group of employees partook in a one-week Outward Bound team-building excursion. Though Gail was fighting breast cancer, she volunteered, claiming she was well enough to endure the hardships of mountain wilderness. As it turned out, the ten women on that expedition hauled Gail to the top of the world (the summit) on a makeshift stretcher. She asked that they keep her secret. Within the year, Gail was gone. Ten years later, one of her team mates tearfully shared her story with me.</p><p> No one is an average Joe. Not Ronnie, not Bruce, Gary, Paul , and certainly not Gail. These folks are a company&rsquo;s most valuable players, the unsung heroes. <strong>  Every leader ought to treat them as such. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 20:16:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 20:16:10.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/in-praise-of-average-joes/\", \"post_id\": \"7910\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 20:16:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 20:16:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"in-praise-of-average-joes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7909\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3691\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/average-joe.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"710\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449692100,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3570,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Expectations, Caring and a Tale of Two Trees","link":"expectations-caring-and-a-tale-of-two-trees","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As my husband and I were comparing schedules this morning, trying to figure out when we will get the chance to get the annual Christmas tree, I was reminded of the contrasting experiences we&rsquo;ve had in the past and how critical it is to deliver on expectations and show that you care.</h3><p> <br/> Year-before-last, we put off buying our Christmas tree until the last minute.  With only two days to spare, before Saint Nick was to hurl himself down our chimney laden with gifts, we made the trek up to northern Westchester County to find our tree.  We had some romantic idea about walking through the snow and cutting down our own, but when we reached the famed-tree-farm, all we found were stumps.  Luckily, Google Maps came to the rescue, guiding us to a nearby tree-competitor, and we adopted our woeful-looking Charlie Brown Christmas tree and took it home.  It wasn&rsquo;t beautiful, but it was ours.</p><p> Last year, we vowed to be more on top of things!  So on the first day of tree-cutting-season, we packed into the Prius and headed north!  I tend to be a loyal-creature, so without hesitation we went back to the birthplace of last year&rsquo;s tree, with money to spend, and what we saw was&hellip;  Well&hellip; it was sad.  That&rsquo;s probably the only way to describe it.</p><p> You see, we had made some assumptions.  We assumed that the reason all the trees looked so dodgy last year was because it was at the end of the season &ndash; that the good ones had all been taken.  We assumed that the reason the place was empty was because everyone else on the planet who celebrates Christmas was more prepared than we, and were spending their last weekend before the holiday singing carols and sipping hot cocoa around their tree instead scrambling to buy one.  We assumed that the reason the &ldquo;bakery&rdquo; was bleak and dirty was because we were were past the date of festivity.  Turned out we assumed wrong.</p><p> All the trees, even on the first day of tree-cutting-season, were dodgy.  The place was empty, except for some family members that were there to hand you a saw and collect your $80.  And the bakery?  It looked like it hadn&rsquo;t been touched since last season.  But they did have hot cider and stale donuts for $4.50.   It broke my loyal heart.</p><p> We bought the cider and the donuts, climbed into the Prius, mapped our way to the other tree farm, and found our way to tree heaven.</p><p> Yes, it&rsquo;s true, last December we found tree heaven.  But don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t keep it from you.  It&rsquo;s called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wilkensfarm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wilken&rsquo;s Farm  </a> </u>  in Yorktown, NY, and it was wonderful!  What an operation!  Hundreds of beautiful trees from which to choose.  Gleeful children running around, laughing and smiling with their families.  Strapping young teenage-boys ready to help.  Holiday music.  Picnic tables and hay-bale-piles.   A scrumptious bakery lit with twinkle lights offering mouth-watering-treats and FREE hot cider.  And when I paid for my tree and wreath, they gave me a free ornament!  How cool was that?!  It was tree-farm-heaven I tell you!  Exactly what we had expected  and just a little more.</p><p> I expected that if there was a bakery, that it would be clean and the food fresh.  Not perfect.</p><p> I expected that if I were going to drive 45 minutes from home to get a tree, instead of to the Home Depot 5 minutes away, that the experience would make it worthwhile.   But the experience didn&rsquo;t need to be perfect.</p><p> If the Charlie-Brown-tree-farm had delivered on my expectations, they would have our business &ndash; probably for years.  If they were to kick in &ldquo;a little more&rdquo; I&rsquo;d probably shout it out to the world (because that&rsquo;s just my style).  But they didn&rsquo;t.  Boo.</p><p> Wilken&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t perfect, it was a working farm, for goodness sake, but the imperfections were easy to overlook because they met my expectations and gave just a little more, which let me know they cared.</p><p> And what did that &ldquo;little more&rdquo; cost them?  The free cider?  The ornament (that had Wilken&rsquo;s Farm on it &ndash; so it served a marketing purpose)?  The young boys working minimum wage helping the hundreds of customers milling about for trees?  The music they played?  It wasn&rsquo;t that they spent a lot that made the difference &ndash; it was that they thought about the experience from the customer&rsquo;s perspective, delivered on our expectations &ndash; and gave us just alittle more.  They cared.</p><p> And now, my heart belongs to Wilken&rsquo;s Farm.  And I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how, with our crazy schedules, we&rsquo;re going to make it out there this year, out of tradition.  And I&rsquo;ll continue to tell everyone I know (and blog about it).  And we&rsquo;ll be one of the many laughing-smiling-families running about in search of the perfect Christmas tree for years to come.  Because that&rsquo;s what happens when you meet expectations and you show that you care.  People are looking for a reason to be loyal.</p><p> This seems like such an obvious thing, when you look at it from a customer-experience-perspective, but (like it or not) it&rsquo;s equally applicable from a leadership-perspective.  People show up in our workplaces filled with enthusiasm and energy to spend, looking for a reason to stick around &ndash; to give their best.  Nobody begins a new position or a new job hoping it will be a bust.  If, as leaders, we can simply put ourselves in their shoes, deliver on expectations and give just a little more &ndash; simply let them know that we care &ndash; then we can harness a relationship that will pay dividends for years to come.</p><h3> Deliver on expectations and let others know you care.  You can harness relationships that will pay dividends for years to come.</h3><p> <br/> Are you doing that?  How do you know?</p><p> Because unless you have hoards of people laughing and smiling around your metaphorical-tree-farm, it might be worth asking the question.</p><p> Were my expectations askew?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  If I&rsquo;m going to spend $80 for a Christmas tree, I expect it to be somewhat Christmas-tree-shaped, healthy enough to last the month, and green.

Being aware of the 5 key risks to your retirement income and making sure that you are protecting yourself will go a long way toward helping you to have the type of retirement that you want.</p><h3> Risks to your Retirement Income</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Canadians are living longer, healthier lives in retirement. </strong></p><p> Being able to enjoy longer healthier life after work is a good thing, but it means that it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect that one or both members of a couple who are aged 65 will live to age 90. If you are thinking of early retirement as an option for you, it means that you will need to have a way to fund 25-30 years of income after you stop working.</p><p> <strong>  2. Inflation eats away at your purchasing power. </strong></p><p> Inflation is a major threat to retirement plans. While it is not likely that we will see inflation rates increase to 1970s levels, a relatively modest annual rate of even 2 percent over a 25-year retirement period can erode a retiree&rsquo;s purchasing power by 40 percent. A retirement portfolio must be able to keep up with inflation.</p><p> <strong>  3. Lack of diversity in asset allocation is not the best strategy to fund your retirement. </strong></p><p> Putting all of your retirement eggs in one basket is not the best approach if your goal is to have a well-funded retirement. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 may have made many people hesitant about investing in the stock market, but equities can provide the type of long-term growth which you will need to fund your retirement. The best choice is to have a diversified portfolio which includes a combination of equities, cash and bonds to provide you with growth and help you ride out periods of inevitable volatility in the market.</p><p> <strong>  4. An aggressive withdrawal rate increases your risk of outliving your investments. </strong></p><p> To ensure that you don&rsquo;t outlive your retirement savings, you will need to be conservative with your withdrawal rate. A safe withdrawal rate is the amount of money that you can withdraw from your investments each year to make your money last in retirement.</p><p> <strong>  5. Increased health care costs can put a strain on your retirement budget. </strong></p><p> Government programs and private insurance do not fund all health care costs. Paying for services which are not covered can deplete savings and interfere with cash flow.</p><h3> How to Protect Yourself and Have the Kind of Retirement You Want</h3><p> <br/> The key to having the kind of retirement you want is to have a written plan. Seeing the numbers is a good way to see where you are now and what you need to do to fund the retirement you want.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 20:47:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 20:47:31.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-risks-to-your-retirement-income-and-how-to-protect-yourself/\", \"post_id\": \"7914\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 20:47:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 20:47:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-risks-to-your-retirement-income-and-how-to-protect-yourself\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7913\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3693\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/risks-to-retirement.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"461\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449673200,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s a fascinating topic, and while there is a lot of research on the matter (pun intended), my perceptions stem more from a combination of patterns I&rsquo;ve seen in the marketplace, a little of the &ldquo;left brain/right brain&rdquo; philosophy and a little empirical research. How are men and women different?</p><p> Things I&rsquo;ve noticed include their age when they embark on their entrepreneurial venture.</p><p> <strong>  Men are younger, riskier, and tend to borrow the capital they need, where women are older, and typically dig into their own money. </strong> Mark Zuckerberg borrowed the capital for his Facebook business, and gazillionaire Sara Blakely cleaned out her savings to start the Spanx company. Mark was still in college, and Sara was nearing 30.</p><p> I mentioned that men are risk takers, as evidenced by the infamous Steve Jobs quote:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Compare that to Sheryl Sandberg who hit the nail on the head when she asked women this:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;What would you do if you weren&rsquo;t afraid?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> <strong>  Women tend to offer a &ldquo;give back&rdquo; aspect to their business operation, like donating to causes that will find clean water for third world countries. </strong> It could be their nurturing side springing forth, or because of their age, they&rsquo;ve seen more of the unfortunates of this world than their younger male counterparts. Women, I believe, are very self-critical, and blame themselves for failed programs. Men, on the other hand, will blame others, the marketplace, or another factor, rather than themselves.</p><p> In this left brain/right brain illustration, we clearly see that women take after the right side, and men the left.  <strong>  An interesting story by  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/30/brain-sex-men-from-mars-women-venus-not-so-says-new-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Guardian of November 30, 2015  </a>   states that the whole &ldquo;men are from mars and women are from venus,&rdquo; is mostly bunk. </strong> A more recent and closer look reveals that the brains of both sexes are similarly unique, with overlapping features, but nothing that would indicate that the brains are from different sides of the galaxy.</p><p> Other notable differences include:</p><li> Women entrepreneurs focus more on their experience and interests. For example, I&rsquo;ve worked with several women who were trying to develop a bra that really fits.</li><li> Women entrepreneurs are more likely to work towards controlled, profitable growth with less interest in merely positioning themselves for a lucrative exit.</li><li> Almost 1 in 5 women say they lack the technical knowledge required for their business, compared to only 1 in 20 men. A quarter of women say they don&rsquo;t have the networks necessary to build their businesses, while less than 1 in 10 men say this is a problem. <li>  <strong>   What we can take away from this is that men are generally more concerned with action and results.  </strong>  Women seem to be more focused, but worried about their success.   <strong>   Or, to put it bluntly, men tend to focus on quantity, while women worry more about quality (I&rsquo;m only saying it like I see it.)  </strong>  <br/>    </li></li><p> In the long run, no matter the gender, they both can fall into the trap of placing more of their time and energy into the passion part of their business, and ignoring the realities of running a business.  <strong>  This is the target of my book Passion and Reality for Business Success and website www.startupconnection.net; that entrepreneurs &ndash; no matter their gender &ndash; frequently overlook crucial issues like competitive analysis, market plans and proper distribution. </strong></p> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-08 21:06:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-08 21:06:30.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/entrepreneurs-how-are-men-and-women-different/\", \"post_id\": \"7916\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-08 21:06:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-08 21:06:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"entrepreneurs-how-are-men-and-women-different\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7915\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3694\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Entrepreneurs-How-are-Men-and-Women-Different-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"794\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449669600,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

However, there are many lessons to be learned from the King&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate plan  </a> </u> .</p><p> In his prime,  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Elvis Presley  </u>    </a> was the highest earning celebrity. It is estimated that he earned around $1 billion during his lifetime.

It all goes back to Elvis&rsquo; manager,  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Tom_Parker\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; Tom Parker  </a> </u> . Now, before we destroy Mr. Parker&rsquo;s character, it&rsquo;s important to note that Elvis&rsquo; manager was responsible for helping the King sign many lucrative deals. However, Parker also charged Presley a 50/50  <a href=\"http://musicians.about.com/od/beingamusician/bb/managercontract.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   manager&rsquo;s fee  </u>    </a> &mdash; a far cry from the industry standard of 20 percent.</p><p> Additionally, Elvis lived a lavish lifestyle filled with expensive properties and automobiles. In fact, he even bought  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac\" target=\"_blank\">   Cadillacs  </a> </u>  as gifts for members of his  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Mafia\" target=\"_blank\">   Memphis Mafia entourage  </a> </u> . Parker also set up companies like  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley_Enterprises\" target=\"_blank\">   Elvis Presley Enterprises  </a> </u>  in order to reduce Presley&rsquo;s share to 22 percent of every dollar earned &mdash; even on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/merchandising.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   merchandising  </a> </u> . When Elvis Presley passed away, his will named his father  <u>  Vernon Presley </u>  as the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   executor  </a> </u> . Unfortunately for Elvis and his estate, Vernon was not financially savvy and thus turned to the ever helpful Parker for legal guidance. Parker managed to persuade Vernon that given his failing health, he should let him manage the Presley estate and receive 50 percent of all income it generated.</p><p> Fortunately, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/probate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   probate  </a> </u>  investigation revealed Parker&rsquo;s schemes and all agreements with Elvis&rsquo; former manager ended. Eventually, the Presley family turned Graceland into a tourist attraction that earned tens of millions of dollars every year.</p><p> Of course the major lesson to be learned from the Elvis Presley estate is choose your executor carefully. Ensure that the person you select is trustworthy and has your best interests at heart. Also, although Elvis Presley&rsquo;s estate was dwindled through the scheming of Tom Parker, the King was smart enough to create a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/testamentarytrust.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   testamentary trust  </a> </u>  where his nine-old daughter  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Marie_Presley\" target=\"_blank\">   Lisa Marie  </a> </u>  was named as the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   beneficiary  </a> </u> .</p><p> Estate planning can be confusing, especially if you have substantial assets.

Since the June collapse, however, there is one sector that continues to score with investors, both here and overseas &ndash; sportswear.</p><h3> The Great Soccer Revival</h3><p> <br/> Back in March the Chinese government announced its plan to improve the country&rsquo;s outlook on sports, beginning with soccer.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2015-08/18/content_21629469.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The soccer reform plan  </a> </u>  issued by the State Council separated the Chinese Football Association from the General Administration of Sports of China, according to China Daily.</p><p> Hopes for the reform include decreased corruption and increased professionalism within the sport of soccer, or &ldquo;football&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s called in China. Perhaps too, Chinese sports enthusiasts would be able to witness their men&rsquo;s soccer team regain ground, having only competed in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/china-wants-better-soccer-great-for-puma-adidas-nike-2015-11\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one FIFA World Cup  </a> </u>  back in 2002.</p><p> The Chinese education ministry has also played a role in this &ldquo;soccer revival.&rdquo; The ministry  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/19/adidas-china-soccer-idUSL5N10U2JR20150819\" target=\"_blank\">   signed a three-year deal  </a> </u>  with sportswear brand Adidas to help promote soccer in schools, &ldquo;with the hope of creating interest in the sport,&rdquo; according to Barclays luxury goods analyst Julian Easthope.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.antasportswear.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Anta Sports  </a> </u> , the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest sportswear brand (that just launched its soccer line in November), is one of the direct beneficiaries of such reforms, in addition to better-known names like Adidas, Nike and Puma.

Average Chinese citizens look up to their leaders, and often will follow or play their leaders&rsquo; sport, explains portfolio manager Xian Liang who grew up in Shanghai.</p><p> Mao Zedong, for example, was best known for his passion for swimming. &ldquo;In the 1950s and 60s public swimming pools were built all over Shanghai, just because Mao Zedong was a devoted swimmer and swam across the Yangtze at the age of 73,&rdquo; says Xian.</p><p> Similarly, Deng Xiaoping, paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1992, was remembered for playing bridge, a card game also enjoyed by Warren Buffett and that Deng learned in France as a young student and revolutionary.</p><p> Mao and Deng enjoyed soccer, too. Mao played goalie in high school and Deng collateralized his clothes to pay for a soccer game ticket in Paris in his earlier years.</p><h3> China&rsquo;s Catching Up to America&rsquo;s Love for Sports</h3><p> <br/> Past game preferences aside, it&rsquo;s clear that Xi&rsquo;s ongoing spirit for soccer, paired with the opportunities presented by recent reform, is transforming China&rsquo;s outlook on sports as well as consumer habits.</p><p> Although America still beats China when it comes to sportswear spending per capita, China is catching up. Spending per capita in China is U.S. $17 per year, compared to U.S. $285 per year spent by Americans,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.barrons.com/articles/china-sportswear-stocks-stage-big-comeback-1444109902\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   according to Barron's  </a> </u> . Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank highlights Chinese sportswear sales at 16 percent, surpassing that of the broader retail market.</p><p> As a more health-conscious, sports-oriented society continues to emerge, Chinese luxury shoppers could also find new interest in sportswear brands that fit their active lifestyles a bit differently than say, Louis Vuitton and Gucci would.</p><p> No matter how you look at it, the industry is changing and sportswear brands continue to score, while other sectors have come up short.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 15:58:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 15:58:33.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-chinese-sector-continues-to-score/\", \"post_id\": \"7922\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 15:58:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 15:58:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-chinese-sector-continues-to-score\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7921\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3699\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/China-Sportswear-Industry.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"871\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449774000,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

However, we sleep specialists usually add the proviso &ldquo;but not close to bedtime.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> We have thought that by raising core body temperature and activating the sympathetic (fight or flight) systems, that exercise right before bed was counterproductive.</p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t you know, just when we thought we had this all figured out, here comes one of those annoying studies that makes us rethink what we thought was a certainty. In this month&rsquo;s journal Sleep Medicine, a study based on the 2013 National Sleep Foundation Sleep in America Poll demonstrates how little we may actually know.</p><p> In this study, 1,000 people were surveyed regarding time of exercise and quality and length of sleep. The results were rather surprising. As expected, early morning exercisers had the best sleep outcomes. They had the highest likelihood of reporting good sleep quality and lowest likelihood of waking unrefreshed. However, the evening moderate or vigorous exercisers did not differ from non-exercisers concerning their sleep. In fact, the vast majority felt that late exercise either had no effect on their sleep or improved it.</p><p> The findings are rather stunning and show that we may have been wrong about the effects of exercise on sleep all along. As the authors point out, it is true that elevated core temperature can hinder sleep, but the rapid drop in temperature occurring soon after exercise may trump that and in fact, help to induce sleep. We also know that after exercise, self-reported anxiety, as well as drops in blood pressure and muscle tension are most evident in the first one to two hours following exercise.</p><h3> What is the take home message?</h3><p> <br/> I, for one, will start to look at timing of exercise differently in my patients with sleep problems. There are many of us who just cannot exercise in the morning, either because of timing or inherent circadian rhythms. It would appear that exercise, even if close to bedtime, is preferable to no exercise. Based upon this study I think all of us need to reexamine our rules of sleep hygiene.

{"original_id":3579,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Should You Tweak Your Retirement Plan to Serve Women?","link":"should-you-tweak-your-retirement-plan-to-serve-women","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Do you have a one size fits all retirement plan or one that considers the specific needs of your plan demographics? </strong> Some might look to the Plan size is a benchmark and others may look to comparisons of average plan balances to similar asset size plans. That fails to consider the actual retirement income needs of the participants. These benchmarks don&rsquo;t consider the needs of women. Let&rsquo;s say that your plan has 80% women. If so, it should consider features that have women savings to the levels suggested by research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute1.</p><h3> Age demographics and women&rsquo;s retirement</h3><p> <br/> Employees who are younger typically will have lower balances compared to older workers even if they save 10% of salary. Research from Employee Benefit Research Institute by Jack VanDerhei, Ph. D1. He shows that men and women have different savings needs. For a 25-year-old man earning as much as $65,000, an 8.2 percent savings rate equates to a 90% success probability. A 25-year-old female earning as much as $65,000 needs a 9 percent savings rate to achieve a 90% success probability. If that same woman waits to age 55 she would have to save 18.5 percent and would see the success probability drop to 50 percent. That is the blessing and savings curse of a longer life expectancy.</p><p> Often women have lower account balances than men even when they make the same income. Why haven&rsquo;t women accumulated more? Often they have taken time out of the workplace to take care of family. They often focus their energies and money on their children. This often is at the expense of their own retirement. It&rsquo;s important that they are tracking the retirement accumulation they need at different age milestones.</p><h3> The average plan balance comparison fallacy</h3><p> <br/> Plan balances are often used to compare plans. Is that the best comparison when focusing on creating adequate balances for a dignified retirement? I know one firm that has a $200,000 plus average balance in their retirement plan. I know another plan that has $150,000 average balance. In isolation, the larger one looks pretty good compared to the other as well to many Americans who have nothing. One of the firms is a large law firm. Based on my expectation of what the average attorney makes, this likely doesn&rsquo;t fund one year of retirement. In either case will that average balance grow to be the number its employees will need to fund their retirement years? In fact, do these balances represent a few million dollar balances averaged with some thousand dollar balances? Focusing on average account balance comparisons fails to focus on the specific retirement savings balance needed in order to live a dignified retirement.</p><h3> Women&rsquo;s retirement readiness benchmarks versus men&rsquo;s</h3><p> <br/> Women face a different set of retirement challenges than men such as longevity, inconsistent employment due to family care responsibilities, etc. Therefore, it would be wise to manage and monitor their retirement progress separately. Women who have been in and out of the workforce likely need some help in recalibrating their retirement savings need.</p><p> Are you using auto enrollment to make sure that all participants are nudged towards being in the plan? Are you using an auto deferral rate? The automatic deferral rate should be based on the majority of the population. You should also consider terminating the loan feature. People get to take loans on their Social Security or pensions? The government assesses a 10% percent early withdrawal penalty and accelerates the taxes on early withdrawals. This should help deter people from not staying focused on the long-term goal of a dignified retirement.</p><p> There is no substitute for an individualized approach. This becomes especially true when there&rsquo;s a lot of income, age, gender, and racial differences in your population. Issues surrounding spouse or no spouse, assume Social Security or not, would be handled on an individualized basis. The customization should come from an advice program or certified financial planner professionals and/or charter retirement planning counselor&rsquo;s help clients focus on accumulating the balance they need to accumulate for a dignified retirement. These two credentials address both the plan sponsor functions and advising employees on how to use the retirement plan to help them pursue a lifetime of financial well-being.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re working with a specialist retirement plan consultant, they should be able to help you look at your advice and education options. Retirement plan consultants affiliated with LPL Financial have access to Worksite Solutions which offers a unique, comprehensive suite of education and advice services. There are other tools in the marketplace that may be better suited for your employees. Look for retirement plan consultants who specialize employee education and advice to help. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 17:24:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 17:24:45.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/should-you-tweak-your-retirement-plan-to-serve-women/\", \"post_id\": \"7930\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 17:24:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 17:24:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"should-you-tweak-your-retirement-plan-to-serve-women\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7929\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3704\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/retirement-plans-for-women.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"732\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449759600,"author_id":207,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3580,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Proven Ways To Get In Front Of Decision Makers","link":"3-proven-ways-to-get-in-front-of-decision-makers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve been buying and selling for close to 20 years. And when it comes to finding ways to get in front of decision makers, I&rsquo;ve tried them all.Cold calling. Networking. Events. Speaking. Blogging. Video. Outbound sales.Been there. Done that.And guess what: some of these work, some of the time.No matter what anyone says, you can get results through cold calling. Networking. Trade shows. Attending conferences.But those results can be few and far between. And they&rsquo;re almost always hard-won.In my experience, there are three methods that work all of the time. No matter what industry. What company size you&rsquo;re targeting. What type of decision makers you&rsquo;re trying to get in touch with.And it&rsquo;s not just my experience either &ndash; there&rsquo;s a ton of data from leading sales research firms (some of which I&rsquo;ll reference in this post) that supports my thinking.</p><h3> How I Get In Front Of Decision Makers</h3>I guess you could say I&rsquo;m blessed with a highly analytical mind. And I hate wasting time. So I track everything in my business religiously.Number of leads generated. Opportunities uncovered. Conversion rates. Deal size. Win rates.And the results are sometimes suprising. And humbling. And every once in a while, they&rsquo;re not what you&rsquo;d expect.Take cold calling. Five years ago, this gave me a 20% conversion rate from call to conversation. And a 20% conversion rate from conversation to meeting. Meaning that out of every 100 dials I made, I ended up with 5 meetings scheduled.So I did that for 6 months, week in, week out. And I actually landed a six-figure sale in three months from starting.Two years later, I thought I&rsquo;d do it again. Except that I made 1000 calls this time. The result ? Not a single meeting. Not-a-one.To me, cold calling is dead. Buried. Not a doubt in my mind.Things change, and what used to work yesterday may not work tomorrow. Meaning my job is to always stay ahead of the curve, trying new things and tweaking them until I get it just right.So I&rsquo;m always tinkering. Always thinking of new stuff to try, new approaches to consider.And over time, I discovered three methods that stand head and shoulders above everything else when it comes to getting in front of decision makers.<h3> #1. Tap Into The Power Of Referrals</h3>If you&rsquo;re not already actively soliciting and getting referrals from your existing client base, you really, really should.Why ?Because they are the most effective, productive and powerful way for getting in touch with decision makers and potential clients inside organizations.The simple fact is this: opportunities generated via referrals have higher close rates (often more than 50%), close faster and close with far fewer steps.If you&rsquo;re looking to get in front of decision makers, consider this: B2B buyers are 5X more likely to engage when introduced (<u> <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/linkedin-sales-solutions/the-impact-of-social-selling-on-sales-perception-45184696\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Linkedin </a></u>), and 73% of executives prefer to work with sales professionals referred by someone they know (<u> <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/sales-solutions/global/en_US/c/pdfs/linkedin-sbi-sales-research-report-us-en-130920.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  IDC </a></u>).When I first started actively pursuing referrals, I was amazed by the results. I went from not having a single referral to getting introductions to almost a dozen people in two weeks. About half of those led to actual meetings.Conversion rate from-ask-to-meeting in referrals: 50%. Conversion rate from cold calling: 5% (and that was back when it actually worked).My good friend and colleague Joanne Black puts it this way: &ldquo;Forget the tired, old sales mantra, &ldquo;Always Be Closing.&rdquo; <u> <a href=\"http://www.nomorecoldcalling.com/too-busy-to-get-referrals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Smart salespeople should &ldquo;Always Be Asking.&rdquo; </a></u> That&rsquo;s how you get referrals and meet your key prospects every time.&rdquo; <h3> #2. Close 74% Of Deals With Research</h3>In our research on <u> <a href=\"/category/grow/sales-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;What Sales Winners Do Differently&rdquo; </a></u>, we interviewed 700 B2B buyers and asked them about why they chose to buy from one firm versus another. The result ?The #1 reasons why buyers choose to buy from one vendor versus another is &ldquo;because the seller educated them with new ideas and perspectives&rdquo;.What&rsquo;s even more interesting is this: according to Forrester Research, <u> <a href=\"http://www.jillkonrath.com/sales-blog/i-finally-had-the-guts-to-ask-this-sales-question\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  you have a 74% chance of closing a deal </a></u> if you&rsquo;re the first vendor to create a viable vision for the future.Here&rsquo;s my own result &ndash; when we started pulling together our panel for our latest research, I approached a few hundred potential panel members. I simply sent two emails, inviting them to be a part of the panel and listing the benefits. Result ? 44% accepted to be on the panel.After the research came out, I reached out to these panel members, offering a 60-minute research briefing call. Result ? A 90% acceptance rate.Over the first two weeks of doing this, I got over a dozen senior executives, most of whom I&rsquo;d never met or spoken with to spend an hour with me on the phone.Conversion rate for research: 40% (90% of 44%). Conversion rate for cold calls: 5%.<h3> #3. Don&rsquo;t Focus On Finding Decision Makers. Make Them Find You.</h3>Sometimes, people ask me why I spend so much time building my brand online. Why not spend that same amount of time simply prospecting, or taking a more direct approach to generating conversations ?Fair question. It is a lot of work.Here&rsquo;s why: I am convinced that, today and in the future, buyers will (continue to) use the Internet as the #1 channel for finding, vetting and connecting with potential vendors and partners. If you&rsquo;re trying to get in front of decision makers, you may want to take that more literally than you initially imagined.Already, 67% of the buying cycle now happens before the seller enters the conversation (Sirius Decisions).And more than 50% of buyers consult third-party sources before consulting a company&rsquo;s salesforce, including third-party sites, feedback from a business partner, social channels and conversations with peers who already have experience with the product or service (<u> <a href=\"http://www.avanade.com/~/media/documents/research%20and%20insights/the-new-customer-journey-global-study.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Avande </a></u>)By comparison, it now takes an average of 18 dials to connect with a potential decision maker, call back rates are less than 1% and less than 24% of sales emails are opened (<u> <a href=\"http://blog.topohq.com/sales-development-technology-the-stack-emerges/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TOPO </a></u>).By now, you should have gotten a pretty good idea of why I relentlessly focus on three core methods to get in front of decision makers: referrals, research and Google.As for you, you&rsquo;ve now got two choices:1. You can read this, and continue on with your life (which is what the vast majority of people reading this will do)2. You can take action, and find a way to incorporate one of these three methods into your sales process. Pronto.As always, the choice is up to you. And I&rsquo;m not a betting man, but if I were, I&rsquo;d take a 74% closing rate any day of the week.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 18:51:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 18:51:17.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-proven-ways-to-get-in-front-of-decision-makers/\", \"post_id\": \"7932\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 18:51:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 18:51:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-proven-ways-to-get-in-front-of-decision-makers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7931\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3705\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Get-in-Front-of-Decision-Makers.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"916\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449779400,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}

It is no longer a matter of knowledge, ability, and skill.</p><p> As entrepreneurs and business owners you need to be psychologically prepared to deal with strong competition, recover from mistakes and failure quickly, tackle tough situations, devise strategies, and  <u>  collaborate with others </u> .</p><p> In other words, you need mental toughness to manage the emotions, thoughts, and behavior that will set you up for success in business and life.</p><p> Mental toughness allows us to push past hard situations and face adversity with confidence.</p><p> Here are 4 secrets of mental toughness taken from the FBI playbook,:</p><h3> <strong>  SECRET #1 Mental Toughness Requires Self-Control </strong></h3><p> <br/> Being the loudest, or toughest, or meanest is not being mentally tough&mdash;it is being a bully. </p><p> People act aggressively out of defense. Only when we do not feel strong enough to resolve a situation do we rely upon aggression as a means of dealing with the conflict.</p><p> The strongest leaders you know do not need to act aggressively because they have power.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS For You: </strong></p><li> Spend your energy on understanding your weaknesses so you can manage them rather than trying to cover them up.</li><li> Focus on turning painful situations into a time for personal growth and meaningful development. </li><li> Control your own emotions, thoughts, and behavior, rather than trying to control other people. Meditation is described as too touchy-feely by many, but it is a valuable tool for building mental toughness. The discipline of continually bringing thoughts and emotions back to where you want them (instead of letting them wander) is the way to start bringing them under your conscious and intentional control. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  SECRET #2 Mental Toughness Requires Positive Thinking </strong></h3><p> <br/> Positive thinkers are not optimists and here is why: </p><li> Positive thinkers believe they will prevail in their circumstances rather than believing their circumstances will change. </li><li> Optimists believe their circumstances will eventually change for the better. <br/>  </li><p> FBI Agents are not optimists who hope or expect an arrest to go without a hitch&mdash;instead, they prepare for the worst and practice ahead of time.</p><p> When they do come across adversity, they don&rsquo;t wait and hope things will change for the better. They adapt quickly to the new situation and remain flexible by choosing to remain positive so that they will find a solution.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS For You: </strong></p><li> Talk positively to yourself.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J863EO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=spacforrent-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001J863EO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research has determined  </a> </u>  that you say between 300-1,000 words to yourself per minute.

I&rsquo;m terrible at this.&rdquo;) <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  SECRET #3 Mental Toughness Requires Grit </strong></h3><p> <br/> Jack Dempsey once said, &ldquo;A champion is someone who gets up when he can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p> He was talking about perseverance and determination&mdash;grit.</p><p> Entrepreneurs, leaders, and business owners all know that while intelligence and creativity are important, you need grit to accomplish anything big.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Researchers like Angela Duckworth  </a> </u>  have found that grit is more predictive of success than IQ in military academies like West Point. </p><p> In fact, grit is unrelated, or even negatively correlated, with talent. When working with West Point cadets, she found that those who scored higher in grit had the mental toughness to keep going when times got tough.</p><p> The high score on grit surpassed other tests such as SAT scores, IQ, class rank, leadership, and physical aptitude when it came to predicting retention rates.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS For You: </strong></p><p> Gritup </p><li> Face your fears</li><li> Pursue work that has value and meaning for you</li><li> Believe in something bigger, better, and bolder than yourself</li><li> Establish strong relationships</li><li> Challenge your brain</li><li> Challenge your body</li><li> Control your emotions and thoughts through meditation and mindfulness exercises <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  SECRET #4 Mental Toughness Requires Visualization </strong></h3><p> <br/> Visualizing your success is a powerful mental toughness tool because when we visualize our success, our brain produces dopamine&mdash;a &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; hormone that associates our visualized success with actual success.</p><p> In fact, parts of our brain can&rsquo;t tell the difference between a visualized version of a successful performance and an actual performance!</p><p> Be careful, however; your brain is smart enough to recognize a fantasy for what it is and will not produce the dopamine that you need to create the motivation to succeed.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS For You: </strong></p><li> Imagine a presentation or meeting in the future where you need to perform at your best</li><li> See yourself in front of the crowd&mdash;what you will be wearing and how you will be standing</li><li> Practice exactly what you will say and how you will say it&mdash;many times</li><li> Anticipate negative reactions or questions from the group</li><li> Imagine how you will respond</li><li> Rehearse your body movements <br/>  </li><p> As our world becomes more and more complex, mental toughness will become an essential mindset.</p><p> Building mental toughness is a life long task, but here is the good news: Mental toughness is not something we were born with&mdash;it is something we can learn.</p><p> When have you been mentally tough?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 18:57:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 18:57:20.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-secrets-of-mental-toughness/\", \"post_id\": \"7934\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 18:57:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 18:57:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-secrets-of-mental-toughness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7933\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3706\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Secrets-of-Mental-Toughness.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"552\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449743400,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

This is  <strong>  money I earned from building my business  </strong> and while I like the fact that our advisor emails me to let me know it was received (this saves me time and worry) he ALWAYS says &ldquo;Just wanted to let you know we received John&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;   <strong>  What does he think the only earner is John, that is so annoying!!!  </strong>  I should say something but I won&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not worth it.   <strong>  The accounts are growing and that is what&rsquo;s important right?  </strong> Hmmmm   <strong>  Feeling happy, NOT&hellip; </strong></p><p> Dear Diary, </p><p> Our financial advisor called today and after asking how I was he immediately asked for John.  Then he and John proceeded to talk about our investments.  I told John how much this bothers me (I&rsquo;ve been telling him for 10 years now) but he just says &ldquo;Hey he is doing a good job with the money, and isn&rsquo;t that why we decided to work with him?&rdquo; <strong>  When I disagreed he just said &ldquo;Your being to sensitive.&rdquo; </strong> <strong>  I hate it when he says that. </strong>   But I guess he is right he is managing the money well but I really don&rsquo;t like it.  <strong>  If I had more time I would deal with this but there is just too much to do. </strong>   Maybe I should just let the two of them handle it, not sure why I&rsquo;m getting so stressed about it.  Feeling frustrated...</p><p> Dear Diary, </p><p> John spent the day at a big sporting event with our financial advisor.  <strong>  I never get to see him and then he spends the whole day with our advisor, are you kidding me.  </strong> And I&rsquo;m home driving the kids and cleaning after a full week of work myself, what&rsquo;s wrong with this picture. And then he comes home exhausted and all he has to say is &ldquo;Our portfolio is doing well&rdquo;, just great!    <strong>  Feeling totally disconnected... </strong></p><h3> Key Points: <br/>  </h3><p> 1.  <strong>  Women are relationship driven; </strong>  While performance is important to women how you develop a relationship with her can often be more important.   <strong>  Never rush off the phone with a woman in order to speak with the husband. </strong>   Finds areas of commonalities, remember details of the woman&rsquo;s life in order to create more conversation and develop the relationship further.</p><p> 2.  <strong>  Engage her from the Start: </strong>  Make it a common policy that you want both parties engaged in the conversations and decision making process.   <strong>  From the start let your prospects know why you feel it is important that both parties are involved </strong>  with every decision and that you want both parties to be clear and confident with the decisions you make.  This will allow you to feel more comfortable reaching out to the woman and asking for her opinion even when you have already received approval from the man in her life.</p><p> 3.  <strong>  Make her Feel Special;  </strong> Women do not wanted to be treated as just a number or customer, they want to like you and want you to like and respect them.  <strong>   Make a point of sending the woman a birthday gift </strong>  or a random gift for another important day in her life, or simply call to share a personal story or to ask about an important event in her life.  This personal touch will go a long way in terms of referrals and loyalty.</p><p> 4.  <strong>  Invite them Both </strong> ; If you have an opportunity to invite the husband to a special event be sure and  <strong>  find an event that the woman would enjoy as well </strong>  or invite the couple and include your own spouse to make it a foursome.  This may not always be easy but where there is a will there is a way. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 18:59:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 18:59:35.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/take-exceptional-efforts-to-turn-your-new-female-client-into-your-most-loyal-raving-fan/\", \"post_id\": \"7936\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 18:59:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 18:59:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"take-exceptional-efforts-to-turn-your-new-female-client-into-your-most-loyal-raving-fan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7935\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3707\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Turn-Your-New-Female-Client-Into-Your-Most-Loyal-Raving-Fan.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"447\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449763200,"author_id":5,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3583,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Deadly Sins of Sales Feedback","link":"7-deadly-sins-of-sales-feedback","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The sales feedback managers give is paramount to both team and individual success. Here's a look at the seven deadly sins to avoid when giving feedback to your team.</p><p> Last week, I took part in not one, but two impassioned conversations about sales feedback with featured guests on the Sales Influencer Series,  <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1J7CYwV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Redhawk Consulting CEO Matt Hottle  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1Gnn7wE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Next Generation Catalyst CEO Ryan Jenkins  </a> </u> .</p><p> In the midst of these conversations, both Hottle and Jenkins emphatically brought up the same point: \"Look at General Electric! They just changed the performance review strategy they've had for 30 years to something radically different!\" </p><h3> <strong>  The 7 Deadly Sins of Sales Feedback </strong></h3><p> <br/> There's a major evolution taking place in how we give sales feedback to our team. To that effect, here are the 7 deadly sins of sales feedback to avoid with your team.</p><h3> Sin #1. Delay feedback for days, weeks or months. <br/>  </h3><p> You should be giving sales feedback as soon as you possibly can. Two cases in point.</p><p> In a  <u>  Blab roundtable </u>  I just did with Dionne Mischler and IT Savvy VP of Sales Vince Gatti, Vince noted that he provides sales feedback every single day.</p><p> In my interview with Ryan Jenkins, Ryan cited a great example of a sales leader he spoke with who sat in his car each day after work and texted his sales reps a piece of either positive feedback or constructive criticism on that day's performance.</p><p> That's the type of sales feedback that proves most effective in 2015, and it's why General Electric saw fit to change its 30 year old performance review structure.</p><h3> Sin #2. Evaluate with your gut instead of data. <br/>  </h3><p> In my post on \" <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1z5YroP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Best Way to Evaluate Sales Rep Performance  </a> </u> ,\" I cited two important articles from  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/02/most-hr-data-is-bad-data\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marcus Buckingham  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/MikeKunkle/managing-sales-productivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mike Kunkle  </a> </u>  illustrating the importance of giving sales feedback that's based on data, rather than gut.</p><p> Quality sales feedback is data-driven. As the Buckingham article points out, most gut-based feedback managers provide reps is wrong, and ultimately reflects more on the manager than the rep itself.</p><p> The tools are out there to provide data-driven feedback, and mangers should deploy those to ensure the feedback they're offering is successful and, most importantly, accurate. Use Mike Kunkle's template to start evaluating sales reps based on data.</p><h3> Sin #3. Fail to incorporate recognition and coaching. <br/>  </h3><p> Sales feedback that does not include recognition of success and coaching lessons is a waste of time and destined to build poor culture.</p><p> Anyone can point at your numbers and tell you, \"Okay, you hit quota!\" or \"You missed quota this month!\" Where you can add a lot of value to feedback is by digging deeper into why you're succeeding or where you can become more effective.</p><p> People love hearing why what they're doing is working -- and if phrased correctly, they'll embrace explanations of how they can do better. Look to incorporate a little of both each time you provide sales feedback and you'll get a lot more out of your conversations.</p><h3> Sin #4. Admonish in public and celebrate in private. <br/>  </h3><p> Huge sin right here. Make it a point to admonish in private and celebrate in public.</p><p> If someone needs to be chastised for failing to hustle or follow the proper process, have that conversation in private and make it a constructive one. You're not going to be able to do so in public.</p><p> Likewise, you should be celebrating success in public -- doing so sets the tone with the rest of your team, increases likelihood of loyalty and helps others know who to go to for help.</p><h3> Sin #5. Don't apply to tangible, set expectations. <br/>  </h3><p> If your sales feedback is completely removed from the tangible expectations you've set for your team -- say, you chastise someone for not making enough phone calls when that's never been a codified point of emphasis in your process, then it's missing the point.</p><p> The whole point of sales feedback is to further cement, reaffirm and align codified expectations. Think of it as an extension or continuation of your initial sales onboarding and training.</p><p> The sales feedback you give should always relate back to that initial onboarding and training. And if it deviates from it -- perhaps due to a change in company process or some other reason -- be sure to clarify that and explain why.</p><h3> Sin #6. Deliver as a monologue, not a dialogue. <br/>  </h3><p> People love to engage in conversations about their performance -- they don't like being talked at. </p><p> If your sales feedback tends to be a soliloquy rather than a mutual dialogue where you both learn from one another, then you're making a huge mistake with how you give feedback.</p><p> You should look at sales feedback as an opportunity to learn from your reps and get their feedback as well.</p><p> The more you learn about them, the obstacles and challenges they face, what motivates them and so forth, the better equipped you'll be to offer directly applicable feedback tailored to their needs.</p><h3> Sin #7. Offer no path to future success. <br/>  </h3><p> Last but not least, sales feedback that does not include a roadmap to future success -- even if it's just, \"keep doing what you're doing,\" is defanged from it's full capabilities.</p><p> Harness the moment and help your reps visualize their path to future success. Make the whole point of the conversation, \"here's how you can succeed moving forward,\" not, \"here's what you did wrong.\"</p><p> As counter-intuitive as it may seem, sales feedback is about having a forward-facing conversation. Look towards the future in your conversation and in the feedback you give, and it will resonate much more with your reps.</p><h3> Making Sales Feedback More Effective <br/>  </h3><p> The sales feedback you provide your team will have an impact, one way or another, on its performance. </p><p> Avoid these 7 deadly sins to assure maximum effectiveness and get the most of your conversations.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 19:26:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 19:26:46.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-deadly-sins-of-sales-feedback/\", \"post_id\": \"7938\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 19:26:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 19:26:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-deadly-sins-of-sales-feedback\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7937\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3708\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Deadly-Sins-of-Sales-Feedback.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1073\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449756000,"author_id":228,"chart_url":""}

What is the primary goal for your website visitors? How are you directing your visitors to accomplish these goals? </strong> If the goal of your website is to create sales and get more business, then it is important that your website has effective Call to Actions, otherwise known as CTAs. A CTA is a button or link that you place on your website to drive prospective customers to become leads by filling out a form on a landing page.</p><p> One of the biggest most costly mistakes that we see on Financial Advisors websites is in their CTA, or lack thereof. Without a call to action, your website cannot generate leads like it is intended to do. You could write the most compelling website copy, and it wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything if a call to action wasn&rsquo;t clearly defined to capture that prospects information. A clear call to action will help to increase your profits by maximizing conversions and improving user experience. In effect, it is the next stage of your sales cycle.</p><p> <strong>  An effective CTA provides: </strong></p><li> Focus to your site</li><li> A way to measure your sites success</li><li> Direction to your visitors <br/>  </li><p> As an Advisor, present your services and start a conversation with people who need your help. Present your value and use calls to action to direct visitors to a contact form, a newsletter subscription, or other call to actions such as:</p><li> Download an E-book</li><li> Make an appointment</li><li> Free consultation</li><li> Interactive Tools</li><li> Webinars <br/>  </li><p> A call to action provides your visitor with direction and a number of different progression points. CTAs must be logical and related to the content on the page. For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a CTA that asks your visitor to &ldquo;Schedule an assessment of their RRSP investment mix&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s a logical path to that call to action? It could be, 1) Visitor enters by searching for some tips on effectively saving for retirement, 2) Visitor likes the article and decides to look at what your practice does with respect to Retirement Savings advice and 3) Visitor sees your call to action to schedule an assessment, clicks on it and submits their contact information (first name, last name, email, etc.). Think about what your calls to action will be and plan out the path for how you want your prospects to get there.</p><p> Not many people pick up the phone these days as a result of visiting a businesses&rsquo; website. This is why it is far better to have a softer call to action that allows you to communicate with your prospects on a regular basis.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 19:43:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 19:43:49.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-youre-losing-clients-by-ignoring-this-critical-website-mistake/\", \"post_id\": \"7940\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 19:43:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 19:43:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-youre-losing-clients-by-ignoring-this-critical-website-mistake\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7939\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3709\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Critical-Website-Mistakes.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"599\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449744300,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3585,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Speed Creates Customer Confidence the Velocity of Customer Service","link":"speed-creates-customer-confidence-the-velocity-of-customer-service","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Create Confidence <br/>  </h3><p> Recently I had the privilege of working with Busey Bank and heard their CEO, Van Dukeman, share a concept he referred to as the  Velocity of Business , which had to do with how quickly business moved.  As I listened to his presentation, I realized the importance of how this applied to the customer service experience.</p><p> Velocity  is a power word.  Fast, powerful, speed, charging ahead, positive motion; these are some of the words that come to mind when I think of the word  velocity .  The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as quickness of motion and rapidity of movement, along with some other more technical definitions.</p><p> So how does  velocity  enter into customer service?  It&rsquo;s about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-experience-2/customer-service-strategy-deliver-value-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   speed  </a> </u>  of service.  How long does the customer have to wait in line, or wait for a return phone call, or an email response &ndash; or for just about anything?  It&rsquo;s about a rapid response, one that meets if not exceeds our customers&rsquo; expectations.  And, at the same time,  velocity  can create confidence.</p><p> I just love it when one of our clients tells us they are impressed with how fast we respond.  Our goal is to return emails and phone calls the same day they are received &ndash; ideally within an hour.  The worst case may be the next business day for emails and phone calls that come in late in the day.  And, if a customer is having a problem, we want to respond within minutes.  We&rsquo;ve been awarded customer service training and speaking contracts because of our ability to quickly respond to our customers&rsquo; requests.  After all, we must practice what we preach!</p><p> I&rsquo;m impressed when I read the reports about how some companies are responding to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-service-2/man-uses-social-media-to-resolve-customer-service-problem/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media  </a> </u>  comments within minutes.  Many of these companies are recognized in surveys and polls for their stellar customer service.  Conversely, I&rsquo;m stunned at the companies who wait 24-48 hours to respond.</p><p> However, the best of the best take the concept of speed to an even higher level by practicing proactive service, the ability to anticipate needs ahead of a customer&rsquo;s request.  It&rsquo;s the server who always fills the guest&rsquo;s water glass before it is empty.  As a very basic example of this concept, we like to track the packages that we ship from our office and email our clients to let them know when they have arrived and who signed for them.  Many times our emails show up in our clients&rsquo; inboxes before the package shows up in their office.</p><p> Velocitize  your business.  Create a sense of urgency.  Respond quickly.  Be proactive and anticipate your customers&rsquo; needs.  It creates confidence, which can ultimately lead to the ever coveted, loyal customer.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 19:48:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 19:48:20.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/speed-creates-customer-confidence-the-velocity-of-customer-service/\", \"post_id\": \"7942\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 19:48:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 19:48:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"speed-creates-customer-confidence-the-velocity-of-customer-service\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7941\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3710\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Speed-creates-customer-confidence-the-velocity-of-customer-service.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"933\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449778500,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3586,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Embracing the “F-Word\"—Inclusive Leaders Should Support Feminism","link":"embracing-the-f-word-inclusive-leaders-should-support-feminism","source_link":null,"content":"<p> While it seems more acceptable to identify as a feminist now than in the past, there&rsquo;s no doubt that feminism still makes some people uncomfortable. In many cases, it&rsquo;s because people don&rsquo;t understand what feminism means. Some people think it&rsquo;s women trying to &ldquo;overthrow&rdquo; men from power; others think it&rsquo;s simply women hating men. Being unaware of what the correct definition is prevents us from addressing unconscious biases toward feminists, which not only hurts women, but can also have a negative effect on business success.</p><p> Merriam-Webster is here to set the record straight.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Feminism  </a> </u>  is defined as &ldquo;the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes&rdquo; and &ldquo;organized activity on behalf of women&rsquo;s rights and interests.&rdquo;</p><p> The key word here is equality. Feminism is truly about fostering a culture that believes women should be equal to men. While it&rsquo;s important that women achieve equality in all aspects of their lives, the workplace is where some may still fail to treat women as equals. But, while some business leaders may be hesitant to embrace this f-word, there are a few who are encouraging others to be feminists.</p><p> One of those leaders is Muhtar Kent, the CEO of Coca-Cola. In Charlotte Alter&rsquo;s  Time  article,  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/4121654/muhtar-kent-feminist/\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent: &rsquo;You Have to Be a Feminist,&rsquo;&rdquo;  </a> </u>  Kent says, &ldquo;&rsquo;If you&rsquo;re a male and you&rsquo;re at the top, you have to be a feminist, and you have to be proud of being a feminist.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy enough to say this, but what&rsquo;s more impressive is that Kent is practicing what he preaches. Alter notes that when Kent became the CEO in 2009, he was shocked that &ldquo;70% of consumers were female, but there were only two women on the corporate board and female senior leadership was in the low teens.&rdquo; It seems that Kent understands the concept of &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inclusion-inc.com/blog/2015/09/01/279/dont_overlook_key_employee_demographics_required_for_growth/#.VmGo4_mrRiI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   key employee demographics required for growth  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> Since his start at Coca-Cola, Kent has worked diligently to try and increase the number of women on the board, and the &ldquo;external hiring of women to senior leadership roles has increased from 13% in 2007 to 28% in 2014.&rdquo; Kent has also start a &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/5by20/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5by20 program  </a> </u> , with the goal of providing economic empowerment to 5 million women by 2020.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, Kent gets the importance of feminism and creating an equal playing field for women in the business world. What&rsquo;s even better, though, is that Kent isn&rsquo;t just doing it because equality for women is the right thing, but because it&rsquo;s also great for business. When you have a diverse board and senior leadership, you gain new perspective and new ideas. In the case of Coca-Cola, 70 percent of their consumers are women.

{"original_id":3587,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Creating A Flourishing, Values-Based Organization","link":"creating-a-flourishing-values-based-organization","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Most people who engage in coaching do so with a desire to improve themselves. Passionate leaders, however, typically strive to enhance their teams, departments, and organizations as well. Wanting to create an engaging and flourishing culture, strong leaders know that they set the tone and are always on the lookout for ways to do that effectively.</h3><p> <br/> As you surely know, success leaves clues and we can learn a lot from the experience of those we admire.</p><p> In that vein, when it comes to coaching around organizational culture, I often find myself referring to the book that captures Zappos&rsquo; experience so well:  Delivering Happiness  by Tony Hsieh. It&rsquo;s a terrific case study of an organization that strives to wow its customers with service, empower employees to make decisions and lead with confidence, and create a fun, engaging, even weird place to work.</p><p> How does Zappos do it?</p><p> <strong>  It starts with one foundational piece upon which everything else is built: core values. </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Your personal core values define who you are, and a company&rsquo;s core values define the company&rsquo;s character and brand,&rdquo; explains Hsieh, who goes on to share Zappos&rsquo; 10 core values:</p><li> Deliver WOW through service.</li><li> Embrace and drive change.</li><li> Create fun and a little weirdness.</li><li> Be adventurous, creative, and open-minded.</li><li> Pursue growth and learning.</li><li> Build open and honest relationships with communication.</li><li> Build a positive team and family spirit.</li><li> Do more with less.</li><li> Be passionate and determined.</li><li> Be humble. <br/>  </li><p> Defining your organizational core values can prove the guidepost for decisions, actions, and commitments. Once clarified, you can turn to your values when interviewing new hires, planning development goals, conducting staff meetings, and more. They become the touchstone of your entire organization.</p><p> The fear, and unfortunately, often the reality is that values become simply another item to put on the website or employee manual and then forget. You must work the values into your day-to-day operations for them to have any bearing, and Zappos does a terrific job of this.</p><p> In probably its most notable example, after their first weeks of training, all new hires are offered $2,000 to quit. Why? &ldquo;We want employees that believe in our long-term vision and want to be a part of our culture,&rdquo; says Hsieh. Fewer than 1 percent take the offer, and Zappos also boasts a retention rate not many can match. To take a phrase from author and researcher Jim Collins, Zappos takes extra measures to &ldquo;get the right people on the bus,&rdquo; and it works.</p><p> The &ldquo;fun and weirdness&rdquo; value is expressed in a variety of ways, from themed costume days to hot dog socials to on-campus petting zoos. And I love some of their strategies for value No. 7, such as &ldquo;The Face Game&rdquo;: In addition to a login and password to get into their computer, the photo of a randomly selected employee will also appear on their screen, and they must identify the person&rsquo;s name. Once they do, a profile and bio of that employee appears to share a bit more insight.</p><p> &ldquo;In the end, it turns out we&rsquo;re all taking different paths in pursuit of the same goal: happiness,&rdquo; writes Hsieh. Creating a positive culture will benefit everyone involved as well as the bottom line, and it all begins with clear values upon which everything else is built.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-09 19:56:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-09 19:56:53.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/creating-a-flourishing-values-based-organization/\", \"post_id\": \"7946\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-09 19:56:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-09 19:56:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"creating-a-flourishing-values-based-organization\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7945\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3712\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Values-Based-Organization.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"595\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449771300,"author_id":150,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3588,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When to Use Passive Voice","link":"when-to-use-passive-voice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> At some point in their career, every writer has heard that they&rsquo;re supposed to avoid the passive voice. People don&rsquo;t want to read the passive voice. They want action! Don&rsquo;t they?</p><p> To some extent, yes. Passive sentences tend to be longer than their active counterparts, and the sentence structure is often more complex, so passive voice is harder to read. It can tire the reader out pretty quickly.</p><p> But there are times when you&rsquo;ll want to use the passive voice, which we&rsquo;ll get into in just a minute. First, let&rsquo;s take a look at what passive voice is &ndash; and what it isn&rsquo;t.</p><h3> Identifying passive voice</h3><p> <br/> Figuring out what is and isn&rsquo;t passive voice can be trickier than you think. If you want to get technical, in a passive sentence, the subject of the sentence is being acted on by the verb. So the subject isn&rsquo;t performing any action itself.</p><p> If you want to get technical, in a passive sentence, the subject of the sentence is being acted on by the verb. So the subject isn&rsquo;t performing any action itself.</p><p> In practical terms, that means most passive sentences have some form of the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; plus the past participle of another verb. For example, &ldquo;Markets were surprised.&rdquo;</p><p> Here&rsquo;s where this gets tricky: Many people see some form of &ldquo;to be&rdquo; plus another verb and assume passive voice. That&rsquo;s not right. For example, &ldquo;The fridge was running&rdquo; is a perfectly active sentence. The &ldquo;fridge&rdquo; is the subject of the sentence, and it&rsquo;s performing an action (&ldquo;running&rdquo;).</p><h3> The zombie rule</h3><p> <br/> Luckily for writers everywhere, Rebecca Johnson came up with a fun way to identify passive voice. She calls it the zombie rule, and it&rsquo;s frighteningly accurate. Rebecca says if you can insert &ldquo;by zombies&rdquo; after the verb, you have passive voice.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s test this out on our two examples above. &ldquo;Markets were surprised [by zombies].&rdquo; Yes, that would be passive voice &ndash; and we can see how it would be surprising.</p><p> &lsquo;Markets were surprised [by zombies].&rsquo; Yes, that would be passive voice &ndash; and we can see how it would be surprising.</p><p> How about &ldquo;The fridge was running [by zombies]&rdquo;? Nope, that doesn&rsquo;t work, because it&rsquo;s not a passive sentence.</p><p> Try the zombie rule on a few examples of your own. It really works!</p><h3> The case for passive voice</h3><p> <br/> Although you shouldn&rsquo;t overuse the passive voice, there are two times when it can be the right choice. First, when the person/thing being acted on is more important than the person/thing performing the action.</p><p> For example, &ldquo;The business was founded in 1925.&rdquo; In this sentence, we don&rsquo;t care who founded the business. We care that it&rsquo;s a solid, well-established business that has been around for 90 years.</p><p> Second, when you don&rsquo;t know who/what is performing the action. For example, &ldquo;The door was left open again.&rdquo; In this case, you don&rsquo;t know who left the door open, but you&rsquo;re mentioning it because it&rsquo;s a consistent problem that you want addressed.</p><p> You could make this sentence active by changing it to &ldquo;Somebody left the door open again.&rdquo; But if your intent is to inform and solve a problem, rather than sound accusatory and angry, passive voice is still the right choice.</p><h3> And the case against it</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re writing sentence after sentence of passive voice because you think it will make your writing sound smarter or more formal, it won&rsquo;t. What it will do is tire your audience out and make them look for something that&rsquo;s easier to read.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re writing sentence after sentence of passive voice because you think it will make your writing sound smarter or more formal, it won&rsquo;t.</p><p> And don&rsquo;t use passive voice to try to hide something, because your audience will know. For example, stay away from statements like &ldquo;Mistakes were made. They are being rectified.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not the same as using the passive voice because you don&rsquo;t know who/what is performing the action. It&rsquo;s an attempt to deflect responsibility. Be open and say, &ldquo;We made mistakes. We&rsquo;re working on fixing them.&rdquo;</p><p> An experienced writer can help you sort through passive and active voice and make your content easier to read.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-10 16:55:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-10 16:55:57.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-to-use-passive-voice/\", \"post_id\": \"7948\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-10 16:55:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-10 16:55:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-to-use-passive-voice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7947\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3713\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/using-the-passive-voice-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1115\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449857700,"author_id":126,"chart_url":""}

In short, being in the corporate world could be very uncomfortable. This doesn't mean, however, that you should let yourself be exhausted, stressed out, unhappy, and unhealthy! It's just a matter of knowing how to keep the right balance between work and life.</h3><p> <br/> So how can you have a better corporate lifestyle? Well, this isn't as complicated as it may seem. There are just some important changes you need to make in your life that will help improve your corporate work day. These are the following:</p><h3> 1. Get up from your office chair every 20 minutes and do some stretching</h3><p> Being sedentary for hours will not just make you feel exhausted, but really bored as well. It is important that you get up from your computer every once in a while to stretch. Reach your hands behind your back, touch your toes, stretch your legs, and do whatever it is that will loosen up your muscles and joints.</p><h3> 2. Take some healthy snacks to work</h3><p> Carrot sticks, banana, almonds, and even hummus with celery are very healthy and easy-to-prepare snacks that can help keep your energy levels high throughout the day. Having these snacks with you will also keep you from getting unhealthy foods from the vending machine.</p><h3> 3. Bring a water bottle and drink all day</h3><p> It is often too easy to forget how dehydrated we actually are when we're in an air-conditioned room for a long period of time. You may not feel thirsty, but your body needs proper hydration for sure. By having your own water bottle on your desk, you will easily remember to drink, and it won't require you to get up several times to get some water.</p><h3> 4. Get some fresh air from time to time</h3><p> Find time to step outside the office just to breathe in some fresh air. This will help keep you awake and alert, and full of energy for the entire day.</p><h3> 5. Make friends at work</h3><p> Humans are social creatures, so it's only natural that having friends to chat with from time to time can make you feel better and more satisfied at work. This doesn't mean, however, that you should spend time talking to an officemate all the time. It would just make you feel better knowing that there is someone from work that you are friends with.</p><h3> 6. Learn to meditate</h3><p> Scientific research has proven several times how meditation can help the human brain.

How can you be world class when your calls aren&rsquo;t quickly returned or when a major appointment is repeatedly postponed?</p><p> &ldquo;The unfortunate thing about this world is that good habits are so much easier to give up than bad ones.&rdquo; &ndash; Somerset Maugham</p><p> If thoughts like these sometimes permeate your thinking, you need to be sure you remember these 6 daily success habits of E.N.C.O.R.E. advisors:</p><h3> 1. Plan and prioritize</h3><p> The most important 15 minutes of each day is the time you spend planning. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you do it at the beginning of the day for the current day or the end of the day for the next day, this activity sets the stage for daily success.</p><p> Sure, planning could take more or less time depending on outside influences, but you need to build at least 15 minutes of daily planning into your schedule.</p><h3> 2. Schedule time for you</h3><p> We all have a tendency to schedule time for others (clients, prospects or teammates), but neglect setting aside time we may need to prepare a proposal, build a list, write a letter or develop a marketing campaign.</p><p> As part of your daily planning process, look at your upcoming schedule for major events requiring advance preparation and block off time to allow yourself to get ready.</p><p> This simple step will help you avoid the procrastination and last minute cramming which often-times lead to work that doesn&rsquo;t meet your highest standards.</p><h3> 3. Clients come first</h3><p> In this step, we are not suggesting you become reactive and always drop what you are doing when a top client calls. At the same time, we know that the more time you spend in client-facing activities, the more successful your business will become.</p><p> World class advisors are spending two-thirds or more of their time in front of clients and prospects on a daily basis. Keep this vital statistic in mind as you prioritize your day.</p><p> Could you leave time for a few extra client calls today? Could your assistant schedule a couple extra prospect appointments later in this week or early nest week?</p><h3> 4. Plant some seeds</h3><p> To our way of thinking, client-facing activities, as referenced in the step 3 above, include time with prospects &ndash; your prospects are your &ldquo;future clients.&rdquo; With this in mind, your daily planning should incorporate a degree of client acquisition activities to keep your new business pipeline flowing.</p><p> If you are a successful veteran advisor, this could be a very small amount of time, perhaps even delegated to a member of your team. If you are new to the industry, this might be your primary focus.</p><p> All world class businesses require a consistent level of commitment to future opportunities. It is best not to ignore this activity until it is urgently required.</p><p> Plan your day to include activities which plant new seeds.</p><h3> 5. Don&rsquo;t let the &ldquo;dishes&rdquo; stack up</h3><p> For most of us, each day brings a certain number of &ldquo;dirty dishes&rdquo;, those small tasks which require little time and are easy to &ldquo;leave in the sink&rdquo; for the next morning.</p><p> These &ldquo;dishes&rdquo; could be a return call, an unanswered email, a thank you note to a client, or any number of other minute details of daily business life. Leave time in your day to polish these tasks off, this will allow you to start each day with a &ldquo;clean sink.&rdquo;</p><h3> 6. Evaluate your progress</h3><p> Finally, at the end of each day, measure your progress by asking yourself a few simple questions: Did you stick to your plan and priorities? Did you keep your appointments with yourself?</p><p> Were you able to maximize the amount of time you spent with clients and prospects? Did you plant some seeds? Will you be able to start the next day with a clean plate?</p><p> The complications of daily life sometimes feel as if they have taken dead aim on our best intentions to be productive and successful.</p><p> You may not always like your own answers to these questions, but keeping an eye on your daily success habits will have a major impact on your ultimate achievement.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-10 17:36:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-10 17:36:48.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-daily-success-habits-for-advisors-to-achieve-a-higher-level-of-results/\", \"post_id\": \"7955\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-10 17:36:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-10 17:36:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-daily-success-habits-for-advisors-to-achieve-a-higher-level-of-results\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7954\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3717\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/higher-levels-of-results.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"686\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449865500,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}

I picked up a gift card at my local Fred  Meyer. The options are endless there, but we chose this gift card for eBay. We also bought all the materials shown here at Fred Meyer, which offered everything we needed from tissue paper to gift bags, ribbon to cute glitter gift boxes &ndash; perfect!</p><p> With a little imagination you can create beautiful gift card holders like the pretty votive candle with a handmade tissue poinsettia paper flower resting on top. The pattern and tutorial for this simple gift topper can be found below. There are lots of gorgeous candles in various sizes available in Fred Meyer. Choose your fave, pop the gift card into the side of the candle container then sit your handmade tissue paper flower on top &ndash; perfect!</p><p> <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Card_Candle_Wrapping.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Kroger_Gift_Card_Candle_Wrapping\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Card_Candle_Wrapping.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> We also made a pretty gold paper bow with the added touch of holly and leaves to top this glittery store bought gift box.

Our fave was this dainty reindeer design &ndash; so cute! We simply wrapped up a package of hot cocoa, added a pretty star made from ribbon and tucked the little package along with the gift card into the mug.</p><p> <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Wrap_Mug_Ribbon.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Kroger_Gift_Wrap_Mug_Ribbon\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Wrap_Mug_Ribbon.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> We also got creative with gift tags. These paper snowmen gift tags have folding arms, which can be wrapped around a gift card perfectly and secured with a little dot of glue! We wrapped the card in a little tissue to add an extra element of surprise.</p><p> <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Card_Gift_Tag.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Kroger_Gift_Card_Gift_Tag\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Card_Gift_Tag.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> How about embellishing a simple gift card bag with tissue berries and holly leaves made from gold ribbon? Everyone loves a personalized gift so we added a simple monogram to the stocking gift bag, which we cut from the same gold ribbon that we used to make the holly leaves &ndash; such fun!</p><p> <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Card_Stocking_Holly.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Kroger_Gift_Card_Stocking_Holly\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kroger_Gift_Card_Stocking_Holly.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> All of our packaging ideas were created using items bought in our local Fred Meyer store (including the gift card!) and are simple for you to re-create at home! Better still, Kroger stores sell gift cards for a number of restaurants and retailers, so you can choose an appropriate gift card for the recipient. Giving a gift card could be the most thoughtful and creative gift you give this Holiday season! Let your imagination soar and have fun! Happy making and have a very Happy Holiday! ~ Lia</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-10 17:57:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-10 17:57:52.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-to-add-a-personal-touch-to-gift-cards/\", \"post_id\": \"7960\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-10 17:57:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-10 17:57:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-to-add-a-personal-touch-to-gift-cards\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7961\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3720\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Ways-to-Add-a-Personal-Touch-to-Gift-Cards.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1356\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449905100,"author_id":305,"chart_url":""}

It takes thought, strategic planning, and due diligence in every regard. And time efficiency will turn the tables in your favor.</p><h3> Success is akin to planting a garden; it takes due diligence, patience, and great care.</h3><p> <br/> Landing in corporate sales was among the most difficult challenges ever encountered. Having held a number of jobs, many times I was handed the most lackluster of territories. The men laughed when they heard where my territory was and figured I&rsquo;d be soon to pack up and leave.</p><p> Fifteen months may be been somewhat soon, but I was the one laughing on the way out. The reason was, I knew how to plant success.</p><h3> Vision: Maintain your fondest vision with you at all times. Create the following lists to assist:</h3><h3> <br/> Milestones to be reached</h3><p> Milestones should be of the caliber to take about six months to reach. Using my example of wanting to be a top producer, the top companies in the territory needed to be contacted. Consider the good challenges you need to claim in order to achieve your current wish.</p><h3> Monthly projects to reach the milestones</h3><p> Plan out six months at a time. Each monthly goal should be a little bit over your head with the commitment you will do everything in your power to learn, implement, and make it happen.</p><h3> Weekly goals</h3><p> On Friday afternoons, with business fresh on your mind, chart out what has to be accomplished the following week. List it all so that you do not waste time on Monday mornings trying to recall what comes next.</p><h3> Daily goals</h3><p> Every evening plan out the next day with the prioritized list of goals. Cross them off one by one and continue to add new ones. By keeping the rhythm going, you actually will achieve 15 months of activity in 12 months.</p><h3> Safety Net ***</h3><p> Interruptions will arise and eat up your time. Create the safety nefor an evening or weekend to complete what went missing. Without backup your likelhood of achieving your ultimate goal in a short time period is diminished. This is the crucial element for planting your success.</p><h3> Focus</h3><p> Many people will allow idle conversation to get in the way of doing what is required to achieve the set goals.

{"original_id":3598,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Tips for Organizing Your Social Media for 2016","link":"5-tips-for-organizing-your-social-media-for-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> So you&rsquo;ve decided to add Social Media to your marketing arsenal for 2016 &ndash; woo hoo!  I&rsquo;m so happy to hear this.</h3>You might be wondering, though, &ldquo;What are some best practices for organizing my social media efforts for 2016?&rdquo; and I have some great tips for you!  Below you will find five fresh and fabulous way to organize your social media for 2016:<h3> 1. Calender Your Efforts</h3>Seems simple enough &ndash; but get a calendar and start to look at all the dates you could talk about financial planning, wealth management, and insurance advice in the coming year.  If you calendar your efforts, you will be much more organized with your thoughts and it won&rsquo;t seem like social media marketing is this overwhelming task.  For example, have you considered:Monthly Themes.  February is American Heart Month.  You could go to the <u> <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/#\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  American Heart Association website </a></u> and find LOTS of material to talk about this topic with your audience.  What about October with Breast Cancer Awareness month? The <a href=\"http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-awareness-month\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  National Breast Cancer Foundation has a wonderful website </u>  </a>with lots of material you could share.   This is a great way to repurpose someone else&rsquo;s content (be sure and give them credit) and provide valuable information and resources about a particular topic.Events.  What about Super Bowl 50 that is coming up on February 07, 2016?  The 88th Academy Awards is coming on February 28, 2016.  You could talk with your audience about their favorite team or ask them about the movies they&rsquo;ve watched &ndash; are any of them ones you should see?  Starting a real conversation with your audience is a way to engage them and learn more about them as clients.<h3> 2. Graphics</h3>You want to use as many graphics as you can in your social media marketing.  When you use pictures, your potential engagement increases.  However, many people do not know where they can go to get free graphics to use.I can tell you that using Google as a resource for graphics is a BAD IDEA!  Many of them are copyright protected and we don&rsquo;t want you to get in any trouble!  My social media buddy, <u> <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/amyvernon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Amy Vernon </a></u>, published an awesome article in Inc. magazine recently on<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/amy-vernon/7-of-the-best-sites-for-high-quality-free-stock-photos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  &ldquo;7 of the Best Sites for High Quality, Free Stock Photos&rdquo; </u></a>.When you go to the article (click <u> <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/amy-vernon/7-of-the-best-sites-for-high-quality-free-stock-photos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  HERE </a></u>), I can tell you that I personally use <u> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Flickr Creative Commons </a></u> a lot.  Most of the graphics you see in my blogs are from there.  I was excited when Amy published this article (and I shared this with my LinkedIn followers) as she pointed the way to new places I didn&rsquo;t know about!   Pretty much everything you need, you can find on one of these seven sites.<h3> 3. Time</h3>When are you gonna do this stuff?  Make the time on your calendar to make sure this gets done.  Seems like a no-brainer, I know, but you have to get this stuff done.  Also, who is going to do this stuff too?  I suggest taking 20-30 minutes each week and working on the next week&rsquo;s material.  If you feel REALLY eager, then work out a couple of weeks in advance.As you do more of this, you will naturally start thinking about more themes and events and ways you can be creative &ndash; -this may take more time too.  Time is an important consideration in doing social media well.  You don&rsquo;t want to be rushed, but I&rsquo;m also quick to remind you don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time doing this either.Find a good balance, but start with at least 20 minutes each week.<h3> 4. Project Management Tool</h3>You really do need a project management tool to organize everything for a variety of reasons. My favorite for this is <a href=\"http://www.trello.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Trello</a>.  My top reasons are because:It&rsquo;s free.  I love free, don&rsquo;t you?It&rsquo;s collaborative.  You can assign (and rescind) as many people to a board to work on as you need.It&rsquo;s accessible.  You can use this from a desktop as easy as you can from a mobile device.As their website says, &ldquo;Infinitely flexible.  Incredibly easy to use.  Great mobile apps. It&rsquo;s free.&rdquo;  What more can you ask for, right?<h3> 5. Social Media Management Tool</h3>You need to manage the social networks and schedule the messaging because you can&rsquo;t do it all in real time.  The best tools for this are <u> <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Buffer </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hootsuite </a></u>.I&rsquo;m particularly fond of Buffer as it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to use for most financial services professionals.  However, you will need to pay for this to schedule more than 10 things out.  I&rsquo;m on the Awesome Plan and pay $102 per year &ndash; &ndash; it works great!  Hootsuite has a free version that will be enough for what you need, but its interface is not as user-friendly.  Pick your poison.  It&rsquo;s not a matter of Buffer and Hootsuite arm wrestling for your business.  Each has their own functionality, but I would still pick Buffer each time to make it easier for you.Using these five tips to organize your social media will give you a great start for 2016.

No matter how careful you&rsquo;ve been all year, it&rsquo;s tempting to splurge on some of the things that make us happiest: good times with friends and family, travel, entertaining, and generous gift-giving to friends, loved ones, and favorite charities.</h3><p> <br/> Here are 9 end of year tips to help make sure you&rsquo;re still on target with budget and strategy and help keep important goals in mind if you&rsquo;re tempted to go over budget during the holidays.</p><li> <strong>  Review your budget:  </strong> See where you can scrimp a little so you have more to spend on holiday fun. Bring lunch to work, skip bottled water or sodas, or take public transportation, for instance and use the money for holiday treats, travel, or gifting. Seeing where you can cut spending may give you some ideas about how to live more frugally in 2016 so you can pay down debt faster or increase your savings significantly.</li><li> <strong>  Max out your 401K:  </strong> Before the end of the year, take full advantage of your company&rsquo;s matching program. Those matching funds are the gift that keeps giving through the power of compound interest.</li><li> <strong>  Use your Flexible Spending Account: </strong>  If you have a flex account for healthcare, transportation, or dependent care, try to use your yearly allowance before the end of the year. Cash in on that new pair of glasses you&rsquo;ve been wanting. If you didn&rsquo;t use it all &ndash; or if you&rsquo;d already spent it all by May &ndash; rethink what you should set aside next year.</li><li> <strong>  Take a look at this year&rsquo;s tax refund: </strong>  Decide if it makes sense to  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/reducing-tax-refund-good-thing-spend/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  reduce how much is withheld </a>  from each paycheck. By reducing your withholding you&rsquo;ll have more money in 2016 for investments, savings, and next year&rsquo;s holiday spending, instead of lending it, interest-free, to Uncle Sam.</li><li> <strong>  Talk to your financial advisor: </strong>  Whether having a conversation about converting from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA or what to declare next year on your taxes, the end of the year is the right time to make new financial decisions. Your  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/top-10-questions-ask-financial-advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial advisor </a>  can also help you determine if you have assets that are either above or below your target allocation. If you&rsquo;re selling at a loss, you can take advantage of a tax write-off!</li><li> <strong>  Review your insurance policies: </strong>  Review any changes in your circumstance or property to make sure you have the right amount of coverage for all contingencies.

But at the end of the day, a social media presence helps in two major fashions: it allows RIAs to better communicate with current clients and connect with potential new ones.</p><p> A  <a href=\"http://www.marketstrategies.com/news/2484/1/Cogent-Reports--Advisors-Mean-Business-When-it-Comes-to-Using-Social-Media.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent study </a>  from Cogent Reports found that more than 76 percent of financial advisors currently use social media for these purposes.</p><p> &ldquo;We know that use and reliance on social media has been increasing among advisors for years, but it was surprising even to us to learn that today there are over 228,000 advisors actively using social media for professional reasons,&rdquo; said John Meunier, a managing director at Cogent Reports.</p><p> Social media campaigns among financial advisors have sprout legs in recent years and proven to be an effective means of acquiring new business. Eric Roberge, founder of fee-only practice Beyond Your Hammock,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/02/want-more-clients-use-these-social-media-strategies.html\" target=\"_blank\">   recently told CNBC  </a> </u>  he signed 21 clients in 17 months primarily by expanding his social media presence and writing a blog.</p><p> Financial advisors have increasingly become savvier to the business benefits of social media, and many have recognized that when paired with consistent media coverage, a social media strategy can help boost AUM and improve client relationships.</p><p> Social media platforms help advisors stay in touch with their industry. Following the Twitter accounts and Facebook pages of competing firms provides advisors with timely information on developments within the sector. Advisors on social media also have access to breaking news and a stage to interact with current and prospective clients. Reading comments on posts allows advisors to take the temperature of their target client demographic and identify opportunities to better serve investors.</p><h3> Interaction is the cornerstone of a successful social media strategy, and creating interesting and sharable content is the best way to get the conversation rolling.</h3><p> <br/> But merely posting promotional content is not enough to build an online presence. As Roberge told CNBC, &ldquo;the key is to balance self-promotion, education and sharing other people&rsquo;s stuff.&rdquo; Voted number one on BrightScope&rsquo;s  <u>  list of top 100 </u>  &ldquo;most social financial advisors&rdquo; in the U.S., Ritholtz Wealth Management&rsquo;s Josh Brown is a master of this balancing act.</p><p> Brown&rsquo;s Twitter handle  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReformedBroker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (@ReformedBroker  </a> </u> ) seamlessly blasts promotional content, financial news and blog posts to its nearly 123,000 followers on a regular basis. Brown also peppers his content with images and videos to attract more attention. According to digital marketing company SME Digital, Tweets accompanied by videos and images  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/7-effective-ways-to-increase-your-social-media-traffic-and-conversions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   garner  </a> </u>  200 percent more user engagement than text-only posts.</p><p> A social media presence like Brown&rsquo;s increases investor awareness of the firm. Prospective clients shopping around for a financial advisor are often searching online. Investors today are spoiled with the option of comparing firms side-by-side. A social media platform that helps represent the value and capabilities of the advisor and his/her firm improves an advisor&rsquo;s chances of being noticed and picking up new business.</p><p> A robust social media strategy, paired with consistent placement in the news, also provides an RIA firm with a critical, and elusive, element to acquiring new business: perceived credibility. Winning the trust and respect of an investor is essential when attempting to onboard new clients. A social media platform provides advisory firms with an avenue to do this.</p><p> Finally, for any business on a tight marketing budget, social media is likely the cheapest way to build a brand. Managing various social media accounts takes time away from an advisor&rsquo;s daily routine. But otherwise, using Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn is free.</p><p> Launching and maintaining a social media campaign can be a daunting task, especially with a set of SEC and FINRA  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p120779.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   regulations  </a> </u>  to follow. But the reality of the situation is that many of your competitors are already using social media to grow their business. Don&rsquo;t fall behind. Start using this low-cost, and effective, channel to reach investors today.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-10 19:05:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-10 19:05:27.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-state-of-social-media-for-ria-firms/\", \"post_id\": \"7971\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-10 19:05:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-10 19:05:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-state-of-social-media-for-ria-firms\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7970\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3725\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-State-of-Social-Media-for-RIA-Firms.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"373\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449904500,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3601,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Overlooked Perks That Every Employee Actually Wants","link":"4-overlooked-perks-that-every-employee-actually-wants","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You hear a lot these days about the importance of offering killer employee perks. That's because nearly 80% of employees care more about the perks they&rsquo;re given than what their actual salary is, according to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/ecs-q3-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Glassdoor  </a> </u> .</p><p> That being the case, in order for your business to attract top talent and land the best candidates, it&rsquo;s critical that you offer an extremely competitive benefits package as a part of your recruitment strategies. No, that competitive package shouldn&rsquo;t include the term &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-useless-common-perks-organizational-culture\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unlimited vacation  </a> </u> &rdquo;&mdash; something we now know to be the nicest way to say, &ldquo;you have to work all the time.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Here are four things it should include: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Free food in the office</h3><p> Although everyone knows they need to buy food to survive, for some reason, it seems terrible to have to spend money on lunch, for example, when you&rsquo;re at the office. After all, you go to work to earn money &mdash; not to spend it.</p><p> Convince your employees that they won&rsquo;t have to open their wallets at work by offering free food and drinks. While some more financially secure companies might be able to spring for gourmet breakfast, lunch, and dinner, others can get by with offering one or two free meals a week. Remember, this benefit is also an investment in productivity: folks can&rsquo;t work as well on empty stomachs, and your employees won&rsquo;t leave the office searching for food either.</p><h3> 2. New gizmos and gadgets</h3><p> Nobody wants to start a job only to be given a five-year-old laptop stained with someone else&rsquo;s palm grease. Or one that runs on an archaic operating system and super-slow processor.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s tech-driven, mobile world, employees want to be able to use the latest tools and technologies at work. These things make work easier. You don&rsquo;t have to give your employees smartphones, tablets, and laptops, but you should make sure they&rsquo;re able to work from anywhere. With a mobile device in hand and access to the cloud, they&rsquo;ll be able to.</p><h3> 3. Flexible schedules</h3><p> As long as employees are doing their jobs well &mdash; and don&rsquo;t miss any meetings or deadlines &mdash; does it really matter when or where they work? In today&rsquo;s day and age, it shouldn&rsquo;t. According to a recent study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/US/en/About-us/Our-people-and-culture/EY-study-highlights-people-want-flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ernest &amp; Young  </a> </u> :  74% of employees indicated that the ability to work flexibly is the benefit that appeals the most to them.  </p><p> If you equip your staff with the right gadgets, they&rsquo;ll have no problem working remotely. And if you provide enough quality food and drink in the office, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about never seeing them</p><h3> 4. Free health insurance</h3><p> Even as healthcare costs rise in perpetuity, U.S. workers believe their employees are responsible for taking care of their own insurance costs. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/13306657/1/employees-expect-companies-to-pay-large-share-of-health-insurance-premium.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Street  </a> </u> :</p><li> More than 50% of workers believe their employers should cover 80% of their healthcare costs</li><li> 14% believe they should cover 100% of them</li><p> <br/> As it stands now, most companies with aggressive benefits packages don&rsquo;t offer their employees wholly free healthcare. Position your company as one that does, and applications will come flooding in. And if you can&rsquo;t afford to cover the total costs, subsidize it as much as you can.</p><p> If, as Glassdoor&rsquo;s research suggests, today&rsquo;s workers care more about perks than salaries, it&rsquo;s time your organization reflects that reality. Better benefits packages will attract better candidates &mdash; which means your business will be stronger.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-10 21:12:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-10 21:12:53.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-overlooked-perks-that-every-employee-actually-wants/\", \"post_id\": \"7973\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-10 21:12:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-10 21:12:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-overlooked-perks-that-every-employee-actually-wants\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7972\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3726\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/perks-for-employees.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"438\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1449846000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3602,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Stand Out in a Sea of Advisors","link":"how-to-stand-out-in-a-sea-of-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Anderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.seic.com/enUS/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI  </u> </a></p><p> This article originally appeared on SEI's Practically Speaking Blog.</p><p> Many years ago, a friend sent me a column from the Detroit Free Press that listed &ldquo;John Anderson&rdquo; as the 6th most common name in America. It made sense, as I fit in as average in almost every other statistical measure out there (height, weight, shoe size, etc.) Based on a recent check, the name was no longer on the top 10 list, but for a time, I was proud to boast that I was Midwestern, plain vanilla and average with a very, very common name. (My parents, Mary and Tom, weren&rsquo;t that original in naming us. Just ask my brothers, Mark and Tom).</p><p> I was reminded of that column last week when I received my weekly &ldquo;people you may know&rdquo; email from LinkedIn. There were about 15 other &ldquo;John Andersons&rdquo; among the 20 names or so they suggested. I&rsquo;m sure some algorithm broke (or were they were sending this as a joke?), but as I sat and stared at all the other Johns, I thought about how difficult it is to stand out when you have the same name. And then I wondered: how do you, as an advisor, stand out in a sea of almost 300,000 other advisors?</p><h3> <strong>  How different are you? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Readers of this blog know that I discuss both brand and value proposition regularly. Without a doubt, when I get on the phone with any advisor, the first questions I ask drive to finding out what the advisor does to set him/herself apart and how clients view him/her.</p><p> It is important that you understand the client&rsquo;s perspective, because in reality, your brand is what others say about you, not what you say about yourself. What I find interesting is that, for the most part, advisors are doing everything they can NOT to differentiate themselves. It could be the words they use when they describe their clients, the look and feel of their websites, or what they tell me they do for clients. But the answers are all so similar that their materials seem interchangeable.</p><p> Let me give you an example to prove my point. Take a look at your website and give yourself a point for each of the following:</p><li> One or fewer &ldquo;business&rdquo; pictures (a formal headshot) of each advisor</li><li> A picture or graphic of a &ldquo;youthful looking&rdquo; older couple walking, talking or smiling</li><li> Content that has remained unchanged for a long time</li><li> An option for a stock quote or current market update</li><li> References to  &ldquo;wealth management&rdquo; and retirement</li><li> Information on &ldquo;our approach,&rdquo; which starts with planning</li><li> Generic resources that offer advice on different topics</li><p> <br/> My guess is that most you scored at least 5 out of a possible 7 in our little quiz. The truth is, I just described almost every advisor website that I have ever seen. Since they all look alike, the higher your score, the more similar you are to everyone else and every other firm out there. No personality, no style. Is that any way to stand out from your competition?</p><h3> <strong>  Your value prop </strong></h3><p> <br/> The website example is just a small way to show how we can differentiate, but I think it makes sense to start there. Frankly, it is how most prospects will form an opinion of you (who you are, who you work with and what you do). And, it is probably the easiest and cheapest thing to update and refresh.</p><p> But before you update your site, I would really dig down deep and ask three questions that can help fine-tune the message and build your value proposition:</p><li> Who are the people/clients that my firm is set up to serve?</li><li> What are the obstacles or challenges they face?</li><li> How does my firm address those obstacles?</li><p> <br/> If you can answer those questions, you have the beginning of and foundation for a clear value proposition. You have the message that you can share with your clients, prospects and on your website. The value prop shows you are focused and specialize in a certain type of client, knowing both them and their issues. By specializing, you stand out in a sea of sameness and can build a brand in that specialty.</p><p> Create your value proposition by combining your answers into a sentence that starts with what you do (#3), who you do it for (#1) and why they need it (#2). In other words, say something like &ldquo;We specialize in &lt;3&gt; for &lt;1&gt; who are facing &lt;2&gt;.&rdquo;</p><p> By taking this new value proposition to your website, how could you reduce your &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; score? By being more targeted, more personal and more focused on the client than on yourself.</p><h3> <strong>  Focus on value </strong></h3><p> <br/> As we begin to close out 2015 ask yourself, &ldquo;Do I want do the same thing as last year, or do I want 2016 to be a standout year?&rdquo; Stand out in a sea of advisors by creating a smaller sea and focusing on the types of clients you want.

And then rush some more. </h3><p> <br/> Especially during the month of December. End of year reports. Gift shopping. Office parties. And all the regular obligations. Yes, our adrenaline is likely to go on mad overdrive.</p><p> Add to this the mental rush. A world in turmoil. San Bernardino. Colorado Springs. Paris. Beirut. We are in shock. We feel vulnerable and less safe. Watch the news. Social media feeds. More mental rushing unleashed. It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p><p> Meditation and prayer help calm our mental and emotional speed. Physical rushing is the easiest rush to manage, yet we tend to race into moment after moment with the flustered energy of the moment before. We steamroll through one social encounter after the next. We don&rsquo;t ever settle in. </p><h3> So &ndash; how do we un-rush?</h3><p> <br/> Before entering a room for a meeting, before answering the phone that rings, before drifting into a holiday party &ndash; stop. Stop and recalibrate. We can recalibrate in a few quick seconds. Here are just some of the ways. Consider these your conscious little experiments for the week:</p><h3> 1. Stop moving.</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t just hit the mental stop button &ndash; no, physically stop. Don&rsquo;t walk, don&rsquo;t run, don&rsquo;t scan the smart-phone, don&rsquo;t turn on the tv. Totally stop for a second or two. Stop.</p><h3> 2. Close your eyes.</h3><p> Open them again. A millisecond close will suffice. The world around you will not change in that millisecond, but when your eyes open again, the world around you will look different. You will actually see what&rsquo;s been in front of you all along. You will &ldquo;be there!&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. Affirm your mental state.</h3><p> By that I mean &ndash; affirm your desired mental state. &ldquo;I feel really rushed today&rdquo; will just keep you feeling really rushed. What about &ldquo;I am talking to some really cool people today?&rdquo; Why not affirm that state of mind?</p><h3> 4. Choose to smile.</h3><p> It&rsquo;s such a clich&eacute;, but boy, it sure works. When I choose to smile, the energy in my body shifts. Even if I&rsquo;m not feeling it, my smile will summon the emotion. So &ndash; don&rsquo;t question the smile. Simply choose it.

{"original_id":3605,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When It Comes to Investing Our Brains Are Wired for Failure","link":"when-it-comes-to-investing-our-brains-are-wired-for-failure","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As I pointed out <a href=\"/advisor/why-do-so-many-investors-and-investment-advisors-do-so-poorly\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   last week  </u> </a> , research shows that most investors and investment advisors woefully underperform the markets. How woeful is woeful? Over the past 30 years, it meant leaving an average of $7,100 per year on the table for every $100,000 invested. For a 401(k) that grows to $1 million at retirement age, this means $71,000 less in retirement income to spend every year. That&rsquo;s a really big deal.</p><h3> The reason: when it comes to investing our brains are wired for failure, and that includes the brains of investment advisors.</h3><p> <br/> You need a system that will make it difficult to give in to your brain's tendency to panic and sabotage your investment strategy.</p><p> Research shows one system that works is to invest a specific percentage of your portfolio in several asset classes and then readjust (by buying or selling gains or losses) each asset class back to the original target allocation at least once a year. <strong>  This is called a static buy-and-hold strategy with periodic rebalancing. </strong></p><p> Creating such a diversified portfolio is simple enough. The hard part is to keep following the strategy during market ups and downs. The easiest way I know of doing this is to give the maintenance of your asset allocation and rebalancing over to someone else with the disciplines and processes in place to follow the strategy, come hell or high water.</p><p> Many 401(k) plans will do this for you if you set them up correctly. First, you will do best not to use the asset allocation fund provided on the 401(k) platform. The recent 21st annual <a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior </a> by Dalbar found the asset allocation fund&rsquo;s overall performance is even worse than that of investors and their advisors.</p><p> To do this yourself, determine the asset allocation that makes sense for your age, income needs at retirement, and risk tolerance. If you're in your 20&rsquo;s, this may be an allocation of 90% in equity and alternative investments and 10% in bonds. If you're in your 60&rsquo;s, this may be 60% in equity and alternative investments and 40% in bonds. If you're retired, with a low risk tolerance, plenty of pension income, and no apparent need to ever tap your portfolio, you might allocate 30% to equities and alternatives and 70% to bonds.</p><p> Next, from the available mutual funds in your plan, select the funds in each asset class that index their market or that have the lowest expense ratios. For example, let&rsquo;s assume you are 55 years old. Your employer&rsquo;s 401(k) plan has a global equity index fund, a REIT (real estate) Index fund, a commodity index fund, and a total bond market index fund. A possible allocation would be 30% in global equity, 15% in REITS, 15% in commodities, and 40% in the total bond market fund. Set your periodic contributions to go into these same funds at the same percentages.</p><p> Finally, pick a firm annual date to rebalance the portfolio yourself. Schedule it as an important appointment and do it without fail, excuse, or hesitation. This step is imperative to long-term success.</p><p> Even better, an increasing number of 401(k) plans will do this automatically and allow you to choose a periodic (quarterly or annual) rebalance option. Set your allocation, choose the automatic rebalance option, and you are now on autopilot.</p><p> Another solution is to find an investment advisor who employs a static buy-and-hold strategy with periodic rebalancing. Of course, there will be an annual charge (the average is $10,000 or less per million). Compare that with earning an extra $71,000 a year in income over 30 years, however, and it becomes a phenomenally good buy.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-12 18:19:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-12 18:19:27.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-it-comes-to-investing-our-brains-are-wired-for-failure/\", \"post_id\": \"7984\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-12 18:19:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-12 18:19:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-it-comes-to-investing-our-brains-are-wired-for-failure\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7983\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3730\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/When-It-Comes-to-Investing-Our-Brains-Are-Wired-for-Failure.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"734\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450155600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s the cheap disrupter, replacing those nasty and expensive financial advisers. Easy to access via the dynamic home page, it&rsquo;s the investment solution for millions who would never pay to see an adviser.</h3><p> <br/> The recent announcements by Macquarie, BT and National Australia Bank have taken roboadvice out of the realm of the startups struggling for resources, to the mainstream where IT budgets run into billions.</p><p> How much of it is form over substance, more about the presentation, the so-called &lsquo;customer experience&rsquo;, than it is about offering appropriate advice and a good investment outcome?</p><h3> It will improve over time, but it&rsquo;s not there yet</h3><p> <br/> Speculating about whether roboadvice will attract money and fill the role of financial advisers is like cogitating about driverless cars. There seems obvious potential, but neither the technology nor the public are ready. But most new technologies start that way, with incumbents failing to see the full potential, then Amazon destroys Borders, Netflix kills Blockbuster and Kodak ignores its own invention, the digital camera.</p><p> The definition of roboadvice is evolving, covering automated financial advice with some formulaic investment solution. In most cases, it works by the customer answering questions online, usually about risk appetite, age, income and assets, and rules are applied to find the optimal allocation of investments. It aims to fill the gap between what the public is willing to pay for financial advice (not much) and what full professional services cost (a lot).</p><p> A software developer recently told me he has a list of 41 roboadvice businesses in Australia either in the market or under development. Globally, companies like Wealthfront, Betterment and Nutmeg have raised hundreds of millions of venture capital dollars, and major businesses like Charles Schwab, Vanguard and Fidelity are already in the market.</p><h3> Two different business models called &lsquo;roboadvice&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> While there will be an unlimited variety of robo offerings, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between the two main emerging types:</p><li> The &lsquo;Business-to-Consumer&rsquo; (B2C) robo, which takes the client all the way from risk profiling through an &lsquo;algorithm&rsquo; to an investment outcome, invariably leading to an asset allocation among different Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) to reduce the cost. The robo&rsquo;s revenue comes from an advice or subscription fee, or a percentage of assets under management following an investment.</li><li> The &lsquo;Business-to-Business&rsquo; (B2B) robo, where an existing superannuation fund offers an online planning tool, a type of retirement outcomes forecaster that simulates a range of retirement incomes based on different market conditions, savings patterns and time horizons. The robo&rsquo;s revenue comes from a licence or usage fee paid by the superannuation fund, or the fund may take equity or own the robo. <br/> ​</li><p> Neither presents a serious threat to full service financial advisers at the moment. Roboadvice cannot handle complex issues like estate planning, social security impacts or selecting aged care facilities. At best, it is limited advice for the masses, the 80% of people who don&rsquo;t see an adviser.</p><p> The B2B tools are useful for member engagement to help people think better about their future super balances. A member who believes $500,000 will fund 30 years in retirement may not bother putting more into super until they realise it will not last their life expectancy with an acceptable living standard. Further enhancements will provide &lsquo;whole of wealth&rsquo; outcomes, not limited to superannuation.</p><h3> Regulator focus on the investment outcomes</h3><p> <br/> It is the B2C robos that will come under greater scrutiny from regulators. They face the added complication of recommending and implementing an actual portfolio as part of a product sale, not simply hypothesising about what might happen a few decades hence. This requires a compliant auto-generated Statement of Advice and a tougher test of whether the recommendation is really right for the client, often based on flimsy profiling.</p><p> While the industry regulator, ASIC, is keen to engage with this new digital world, it will not be doing any favours to the upstarts. Louise Macaulay, ASIC&rsquo;s Senior Executive Leader in the financial services team, told the recent Financial Planning Association (FPA) Conference:</p><p> &ldquo;Our view is that the legislation is tech neutral. The same standards will apply whether it&rsquo;s technology-based advice, or face to face &hellip; They (roboadvisers) need to make sure that clients understand what they are buying; and that they are not just clicking from one screen to another.&rdquo;</p><p> Although the B2C roboadvisers claim to be offering personal advice, the simple questions currently generate only superficial information resulting in standardised asset allocations. Some robos ask only a few basic questions about risk appetite, time horizon and capacity for loss.</p><h3> Louise Macaulay went on to say:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;The sector needs to improve the compliance and record keeping. There is also the potential for large scale loss if there is a flaw in the algorithm.&rdquo;</p><p> In May 2015, the United States&rsquo; Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a caution about roboadvice:</p><p> &ldquo;An automated investment tool may not assess all of your particular circumstances, such as your age, financial situation and needs, investment experience, other holdings, tax situation, willingness to risk losing your investment money for potentially higher investment returns, time horizon for investing, need for cash, and investment goals. Consequently, some tools may suggest investments (including asset-allocation models) that may not be right for you.&rdquo;</p><h3> The robo investment experience</h3><p> <br/> I completed the online application process of an Australian roboadviser, expecting a growth-oriented portfolio based on my responses. It allocated for me 44% into Australian government bonds, 10% into gold and 11% in emerging markets equities. That is 65% of nothing I want, such as Australian shares, developed country shares, corporate bonds and property. Anyone given such a portfolio should carefully scrutinise whether it is right for them, especially when government bond ETFs yield less than 2%.</p><p> And the total cost on a $20,000 investment with this low cost disrupter&rsquo;? It was 1.6% per annum, including management fee, administration fee and investment fee, far more than the standard MySuper fund from retail and industry fund incumbents of below 1%.</p><h3> Gaining a consumer foothold will be tough</h3><p> <br/> Most startups without links to existing clients will not succeed in their own right in gaining a strong enough investor base. The cost of acquiring customers will be too great and the competition at low or no margins will become intense from the big names. Many startups will turn into B2B players and sell out to large impatient retail or superannuation funds who want the intellectual property and a few smart resources on the team.</p><p> It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before more large wealth players use robo to transition customers to their more complete services. Global names like Charles Schwab have no existing Australian business to cannibalise, and a company like Blackrock can drive demand for its ETFs. Expect these companies to have sophisticated offers at price points no new startup can match.</p><p> As a result of the moves into roboadvice, consumers who currently receive no financial advice will benefit. With sophisticated graphics and informative modelling of outcomes, robo offers will increase in sophistication and attract thousands who would never visit a financial adviser. Roboadvice will gradually improve in ways we can only speculate on, much like we could not foresee the extraordinary ways other technologies have changed our lives.</p><p> And the full service, personal adviser? Many will embrace robo to service the disengaged or less wealthy, and there will always be a role for person-to-person contact. Regardless of how good the website is, it will never put an arm around the worried investor and explain market events with an intimate knowledge of the client&rsquo;s experience, entire background and goals.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-13 15:57:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-13 15:57:09.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/looking-deeper-than-the-home-page-of-roboadvice/\", \"post_id\": \"7986\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-13 15:57:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-13 15:57:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"looking-deeper-than-the-home-page-of-roboadvice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7985\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3731\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Beyond-the-homepage-of-robo-advice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"428\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450086300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

They are trusted sources who move and inspire people with innovative ideas; turn ideas into reality, and know and show how to replicate their success.&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> Somebody a few years ago called me a &ldquo;thought leader&rdquo;, and I was quite taken aback.  It seemed then to be quite a pretentious phrase.  Something that conjured up visions of being a Tom Peters, or David Maister, or De Bono&hellip;.which I most certainly am not&hellip;.and it still does seem to be a phrase which is generally regarded as one that is a description of the giants of business thinking.</p><p> However I have slowly come to the realisation that all great advisers in professional services are thought leaders.  They are the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; people in their area of expertise.  They inspire changes of actions, plans and behaviour.  They are trusted.</p><h3> They inspire others.</h3><p> <br/> Clients, peers, staff, younger advisers whom they are mentoring&hellip;all are inspired by the great advisers.  All are taught to think in different and new directions.</p><h3> So I have concluded that all great advisers are thought leaders.</h3><p> <br/> I also concluded that a major difference between the great advisers and those that remain ordinary is the willingness to accept the role, and responsibility, of being a thought leader.</p><p> When I say &ldquo;accept&rdquo; it, I mean that they get comfortable in their own minds with it, as opposed to having it conferred on them by others.  It does seem to be pretentious at first.  But once a professional accepts in their own mind that a large element of their role is to move and inspire others, rather than simply advise, it changes their approach to business and the world at large.  There is a responsibility to continue educating others, and developing ideas and being innovative with solutions, and thinking more strategically about trends and implications of events and decisions.</p><p> Accepting that being a thought leader is essential to being great is what leads to a virtuous cycle of thinking more strategically, and being more willing to take the risk of speaking out first, or with what may be perceived as radically different ideas.  In other words, accepting the epithet creates the responsibility of living up to it.</p><p> The professionals whom I have observed over the years who have accepted the responsibility and embrace it inevitably become great professionals who motivate many many others.</p><p> There is no doubt in my mind that advisers wanting to move from being ordinary to becoming a highly valued and great professional, must begin by accepting that their&rsquo;s is a thought leadership role.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-13 16:07:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-13 16:07:13.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-great-adviser-is-or-should-be-a-thought-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"7988\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-13 16:07:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-13 16:07:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-great-adviser-is-or-should-be-a-thought-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7987\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3732\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/advisors-should-be-thought-leaders.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"675\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450090800,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3608,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Pointy End of PR: How to Sharpen up Your Integrated PR for Lead Generation in Financial Services","link":"the-pointy-end-of-pr-how-to-sharpen-up-your-integrated-pr-for-lead-generation-in-financial-services","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  Danielle Stitt </u></p><p> There are three ways to slice and dice your integrated public relations to help grow your business: awareness, SEO and lead generation. Awareness is well understood but here we will deep dive into how you can leverage your PR efforts within your integrated digital marketing strategy to drive fresh leads into your marketing funnel.                            </p><p> Public relations is still one of the most effective tools in the financial services marketer&rsquo;s kit. It builds trust through perceived third party endorsement, broadens your audience beyond your own networks and can help drive new leads to your website. Wait! Drive leads? How does that work?</p><h3> Glad you asked.</h3><p> <br/> Previously we&rsquo;ve written about using PR for brand awareness through your  <u>  content strategy </u>  and for driving SEO, The unlikely marriage of PR and SEO, and five tips to make the match, <u>  here </u> .</p><p> In this post, we will deep dive into how you can keep the sales team (and CEO) happy with new leads, and not just any old leads but high quality, likely-to-convert ones.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Define what a lead is </strong></h3><p> <br/> Different financial services organisations and different campaigns will have different definitions of a lead. For one of our clients, a robo-advice start up, a lead is a new user of their  <a href=\"https://www.mapmyplan.com.au/?utm_source=BlueChip%20blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=pr_for_lead_gen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  free financial planning tool </a> . For another client, a lead is a subscriber to a weekly newsletter.</p><p> And while you may be in a hurry to get &ldquo;doing&rdquo;, defining what a lead is for your company and the campaign at hand is important because:</p><li> It forces you to focus on the desired outcome (e.g. newsletter subscribers, webinar attendees, users of your online tool/calculator)</li><li> It allows you to set KPIs (e.g. 25% increase in subscribers, 50 webinar attendees, 200 online tool/ calculator users)</li><li> You will know where in the marketing funnel your campaign is operating and therefore what offer is going to be most compelling. Are your leads top of the funnel in information gathering mode or further down and getting ready to make a purchase decision? <br/>  </li><p> The lead&rsquo;s position in the marketing funnel will inform what you do with them next. For example, prospects who sign up for a newsletter are more likely to be educating themselves and unlikely to be ready for a call from a sales team member. Better to put them on an education-driven nurture track. Conversely, someone who downloaded your e-book comparing the features of your insurance policy versus the competitors&rsquo; is more likely on the verge of making a purchase decision and could benefit from speaking to a helpful customer service team member.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Create your offer and content package (a.k.a. lead magnet) </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no getting around this step &ndash; and it involves a bit of work. This is what you need to know:</p><li> Segment e.g. SMSF trustees</li><li> Problem e.g. administering their funds&rsquo; assets</li><li> Solution e.g. Top tips on how to effortlessly set up your SMSF&rsquo;s administration structure &ndash; could be an e-book, checklist, video etc &ndash; also known as &ldquo;lead magnet&rdquo;</li><li> Landing page i.e. where the prospect can enter their contact details and receive the solution (lead magnet). Ideally the contact details form is integrated with your CRM</li><li> <u>  Landing page URL </u> e.g. (and see how we used our SEO keywords in the title of the offer and the landing page&rsquo;s URL. Use your keywords wherever you can) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Tip: Choose one problem and one solution at a time. </strong></p><p> Your lead magnet must solve a real problem for your target audience. It should be high value enough that a prospect is willing to exchange their details for it. Subsequently it should contain enough &ldquo;meat&rdquo; that you will be able to break it down to a series of blogs, social media posts and potentially social media ads and a media pitch (see next section).</p><p> Importantly, all these atomised pieces of content should include a link to your lead magnet landing page. Someone who reads your blog without leaving any contact details is just a visitor, not a lead, and may never come back. Basically you haven&rsquo;t created a lead. And that won&rsquo;t make your sales team (or CEO) happy!</p><h3> <strong>  3. Research potentially interested media outlets </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are two places to research.</p><p> First, look at your website analytics data, for instance Google Analytics, to see which media outlets drive your most engaged visitors. A simple definition of an engaged visitor is someone who visits a lot of pages and stays on your website for a while. If you&rsquo;re looking for a more complex engagement score, Marketing Sherpa shows how to  <a href=\"https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/how-to/calculate-scores-every-visitor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  calculate your engagement index </a>  based on click depth, recency, duration, loyalty, brand, feedback and interaction.</p><p> For example, BlueChip helped launch a new share purchase app this year. The client&rsquo;s analytics software showed us where the most engaged visitors came from by media outlet, influencer and social media platform. As Table 1 shows, Intelligent Investor drove 105 visitors within 24 hours, and those visitors spent nearly six minutes on our client&rsquo;s website and viewed 3.49 pages of content. This tells us Intelligent Investor reaches our target audience. It also tells us that Intelligent Investor should be on the short-list of media outlets to pitch our content to (but see the next paragraph before you get too excited).</p><p> Table 1: Google Analytics report showing website traffic source (yellow = media outlet, green = influencer, blue = social media platform)  </p><p> Second, research what topics media outlets and journalists have previously covered (e.g. SMSF administration if we continue the example from section 2). Clearly you&rsquo;ll want to start with the media outlets and influencers we&rsquo;ve just identified. Your pitch should acknowledge the journalist&rsquo;s previous articles and offer a further insight or development worth covering.</p><p> Most important, ensure your landing page URL is in your media pitch or contributed content. The journalist isn&rsquo;t going to include it if you don&rsquo;t suggest it and indeed may not even include it in the final article anyway. But quite often they do IF the meaty piece of content you&rsquo;re driving people to offers the journalist&rsquo;s readers some value.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Beyond PR </strong></h3><p> <br/> You should also include the landing page URL in the relevant blogs, social media posts etc. Essentially, include that baby anywhere it makes sense to do so. This goes beyond PR, obviously, but there is no point building beautiful content if no one knows about it. Some suggested places for your landing page URL are:</p><li> Email signature</li><li> Press release footer/ boilerplate section</li><li> Blogs</li><li> Social media</li><li> eDMs</li><li> Website homepage <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  5. Launch, measure, learn, launch again </strong></h3><p> <br/> I heard a wonderful quote that there is no failure in marketing, only wins and learnings. Perhaps the only failure is the failure to act. So, now armed with this shiny lead gen strategy, it&rsquo;s your turn to act. As always, we recommend planning, tracking, analysing and improving, no matter what marketing activity you&rsquo;re undertaking.</p><p> And if you want to learn more about lead gen, we recently hosted a snappy 30 actionable lead gen tips in 30 minutes for financial services <a href=\"http://content.bluechipcommunication.com.au/webinar-30-actionable-lead-generation-tips-financial-services-cmos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   webinar  </u> </a> .

The phone rang many times (ok it&rsquo;s their busy season). When I finally got connected to a real person, they proceeded to speak over me and share some garbled information. I had ordered from them previously, but the individual on the other end could not find my file. This went on and on until they finally said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you. I need to find my supervisor.&rdquo; And they immediately put me on &ldquo;hold&rdquo; and never came back.</p><p> Frustrated and knowing I had limited time to place this order; I did what many of you would do.

Never let the ball drop</h3><p> <br/> When the person on my initial call dropped me and didn&rsquo;t return, it made me feel as if I didn&rsquo;t matter to them. I felt like just another phone call, not a valuable customer. What the individual could have done was take my name and number and say that if we got disconnected, they would call back. Similarly, we need to follow through with our customers in the workplace. If we don&rsquo;t have an immediate answer, make sure to re-connect with them after you find out.</p><h3> 4. Offer helpful advice</h3><p> <br/> Whenever possible, it is a great idea to authentically ask: &ldquo;How may I help you?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t stop at a first response, but make sure to understand their true concerns and respond in a generous way. Another statement that can make a difference is: &ldquo;I really want to help you solve this problem.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5.

I remember the shock by the first Meerkat I watched &ndash; it was someone singing in their car, and when it went live, my initial reaction was to cover the camera on my phone. I felt like he could see me! Thankfully he couldn&rsquo;t. But it seemed like I was privy to a very private moment.</p><p> However, the marketer in me started geeking out over with all the branding opportunities this medium presented for personal and professional brands.</p><p> This year I traveled to NYC and Minneapolis to work for clients to live stream events, and help to create an experience for the folks unable to join. The first conference was the PhotoPlus Expo in NYC. This event is the largest photography conference in the US, and it was impressive to say the least. Over 30,000 flocked to the Javits Center to enjoy the gorgeous displays of Canon, Nikon, and many more. And my job was to make that available to the folks unable to attend the conference, and amplify the brand I represented. I Periscoped photography classes, conference attendees, and keynotes like Jimmy Chin, who I could have listened to all day.</p><p> The second project was a tech conference called MobCon hosted annually by MentorMate, a leading Android/iOS mobile app development company that&rsquo;s paving the way for mobile tech. This project was very different in that I was covering an event for the host, not as an attendee, and it made an enormous difference in how much control we had and what we were able to accomplish.</p><h3> This knowledge is what I want to share with you because live streaming an event can be very lucrative for any brand. It will produce a LOT of content to be repurposed and used for social networks, it will extend the reach of your brand during the event, and will create experiences for those unable to join who may choose to do so in the future.</h3><p> <br/> I could easily write several posts on all I learned during these projects, but for this purpose of this article, we&rsquo;ll stick to the how-to&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll write follow-ups in the future.</p><p> So roll up your sleeves and start taking notes because if you want to do it right, it will take a lot more than flipping the switch on a Periscope channel.</p><h3> <strong>  How to Live Stream an Event </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Define the live streaming goals.</h3><p> <br/> Goals are crucial to every project, no matter how small or large. They will help you to stay focused on the bigger picture, and make planning easier. Live streaming an event is no different. You&rsquo;ll want to be clear on exactly what you hope to do and the outcome of those actions.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a list of a few things to consider:</p><li> <strong>  What is the main purpose of live streaming for this event? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What moments do I want to capture? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will I be conducting interviews? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What equipment will be needed? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What kind of resources do I have for the venue? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will I need help or assistance? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How will I backup the captured content? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do I need to consider any private policies for speakers/attendees? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Which live streaming platforms will be used: Periscope, Meerkat or Blab? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Make a schedule for the event</h3><p> <br/> With MobCon and PhotoPlus Expo, there was a speaking/event schedule published months ahead of the conferences, so I compiled a schedule for myself on what needed to be done and where once I defined my goals for the event.</p><p> Print out a copy of the event schedule and create one for yourself based on your goals. Things to take into consideration:</p><li> <strong>  If you want to interview people &ndash; contact them ahead of time to ask for their permission and give them a head&rsquo;s up. </strong> This ensures they&rsquo;re ready to be on camera (key for the ladies) and displays professionalism.</li><li> <strong>  Are there any time issues to work out ahead of time? </strong> Pinpoint all time disruptions and decide how to deal with them ahead of time, if possible.</li><li> <strong>  What kinds of equipment will be most useful at this event? </strong> The tech gear used for MobCon was very different than PhotoPlus Expo because we had control of the space at Mobcon, and could choose where to host interviews or Periscope keynotes. If you know people who live stream events, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to reach out and ask their opinion on the latest tech. Even if you don&rsquo;t end up using it, you&rsquo;ll have a good idea on what options are available.</li><li> <strong>  Go visit the space ahead of time. </strong> This won&rsquo;t always be possible, but the earlier you understand the layout of where the event will be held the better. I&rsquo;m a visual person, so it&rsquo;s very useful to me to know what space I&rsquo;ll be working in ahead of time.</li><li> <strong>  Set up ways to catch your live streaming outside of the the actual stream. </strong> If you&rsquo;re using Periscope, set up a Katch account. If you&rsquo;re Blabbing, you&rsquo;ll want to record it. BUT it&rsquo;s crucial to think about backups of your backups. At MobCon, we encountered a random technical issue during an interview with the conference&rsquo;s favorite speaker, and we didn&rsquo;t know it until it was too late. Instead of having an excellent 20 minute interview to share, we were only left with a little over 6 minutes. Talk about SAD! But it was a great lesson to always have an additional camera set up to capture interviews in case Periscope and Katch don&rsquo;t work out. With Blab, you could use an app like Screenflow to capture what&rsquo;s happening on your desktop. Bottom line, just like photography &ndash; have a backup for your backup.</li><li> <strong>  Decide who you want to interview and get to know them. </strong> At Mobcon, I was responsible for interviewing several of the speakers, so I did a lot of research ahead of time on who they are as professionals and everyday people. I wanted to feel comfortable talking business, but also have the insight to refer to their personal interests during the interviews. This let them know I was genuinely interested in who they are as people. When you can reference something that isn&rsquo;t common knowledge, it always brings a smile to their face. But bottom line, it&rsquo;s professional to do your homework ahead of time and be prepared. In addition to research, write out your questions ahead of time, but know you won&rsquo;t necessarily have to follow that line of questioning if an answer brings out another interesting concept. My best advice and something I learned at MobCon is to play off of my natural curiosity when interviewing someone. This gives the interview a natural feel instead of being scripted. BUT being prepared will allow the confidence to make those decisions. <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Start promoting the live streaming online</h3><p> <br/> Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed the background work, it&rsquo;s time to start promoting what you&rsquo;re doing. The sooner you can get started ahead of the event, the better, especially if you have a small audience or haven&rsquo;t been live streaming up to this point.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t ever conducted a Pericope or Blab, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to create an account and start promoting those channels across other social networks, email newsletters, blogs, and on your website. Utilize any channel you can to bring new followers to the account, and don&rsquo;t be shy to straight up ask for it from your current followers. If you&rsquo;re already providing value then they will want to hear from you in other places, and will be curious to see new things.</p><p> For the PhotoPlus Expo event, I was notified of that event a little over a week ahead of time, so there wasn&rsquo;t much of a chance to promote what we&rsquo;d be doing. But we created a Facebook ad, pushed the information out on multiple social channels, promoted the new Periscope channel, and conducted a Periscope the night before the event started at the brand networking event. However, with Mobcon we started a month ahead. Ryan did a few Periscopes leading up to the event, I did one, a blog was written, it was promoted on social networks, and in company emails.</p><p> The additional time with MobCon made a big difference in how much participation we had during the event. Even though it was still a relatively small audience, they were excited and engaged throughout the conference.</p><p> Finally, it&rsquo;s key to utilize any contacts who are already on Periscope or Blab and ask them to promote your event and/or interview you about it. This is a great way to get promotional coverage without it being directly from your brand, which can make a huge difference. Pinpoint influencers you have relationships with and who would be interested in the type of event. It will be easier to get their support IF it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;d naturally be interested in.</p><h3> 4. Share the event set up</h3><p> <br/> The event setup is the part that happens before folks arrive.</p><p> If it&rsquo;s a conference, you typically have a day of seats being arranged, equipment tests, etc. and this can be a fun and engaging way to kick off the live streaming. It will be the perfect time to test out all your equipment &ndash; mics, tripods, stabilizers, cameras, etc &ndash; and give the audience behind-the-scenes access to setting up the event.</p><p> A few things to consider:</p><li> <strong>  What equipment needs to be tested? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Where is the best place to set up equipment during the event? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Where is the best lighting for interviews (if you&rsquo;re conducting them)? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What is the quality of sound with and without additional mics? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Are there places to leave additional equipment? </strong></li><li> <strong>  WHERE will you charge up? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s NOT sexy to run out of batteries mid-stream or mid-interview, so take every precaution to avoid it. At MobCon, we had an additional charging panel installed beneath our seats where we worked throughout the event to charge our phones and laptops. But both of us were amply prepared with additional chargers if need be. At one point, I had a charger hanging off my phone to keep it charged during a Periscope because the outlet was too far.</p><p> Bottom line, be as prepared as possible ahead of time. Leave nothing to the imagination if you can help it.</p><h3> 5. Ready, set, action!</h3><p> <br/> Now that you&rsquo;ve done all the work, it&rsquo;s go time!!</p><p> My best advice is:</p><li> <strong>  Get lots of rest and be hydrated for the event. </strong> You&rsquo;ll be anxious and that&rsquo;s normal, but if you&rsquo;re rested and taking proper care of yourself, you&rsquo;ll deal with the stress effortlessly.</li><li> <strong>  Make a decision ahead of time that you will go with the flow </strong> , regardless of what happens. No matter how much you plan and measure ahead of time &ndash; there&rsquo;s going to be plenty that won&rsquo;t work out. And that&rsquo;s okay! At MobCon, we wanted to a lot more than we had time for. While that may upset some people, the way I view it is that we&rsquo;ll have more surprises to pull out of the bag for the next conference.</li><li> <strong>  Print out all your materials and be prepared. </strong> Take the conference schedule, your schedule, and speaker questions with you. Also, prepare titles for the live streaming ahead of time, so you can copy and paste them without hurry.</li><li> <strong>  Have fun!! </strong> I had a blast at PhotoPlus Expo and Mobcon, and even though not everything worked out according to plan, I was able to enjoy them because the work was done ahead of time. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Overview: </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a TON of information I&rsquo;m leaving out, but that simply means you&rsquo;ll need to come back!</p><p> Live streaming an event is much more about the background work than the actual on site work, so do your research, nerd out with schedules and tech, and make sure you&rsquo;re prepared because when the day comes &ndash; you should enjoy it! Similar to cooking &ndash; when it&rsquo;s prepared with love, it melts in your mouth. But when it&rsquo;s prepared by a stressed out or anxious person &ndash; it won&rsquo;t be enjoyable.</p><p> But now I want your opinion &ndash; Have I left out anything?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-13 16:47:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-13 16:47:38.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-live-stream-an-event-with-periscope-or-blab/\", \"post_id\": \"7994\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-13 16:47:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-13 16:47:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-live-stream-an-event-with-periscope-or-blab\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7993\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3735\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Live-Stream-an-Event.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"877\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450099800,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}

Yet, there are a plethora of decisions to make once you shift these precious dollars to your digital marketing budget. Do you invest heavily in search marketing or social media? Various opinions have been flying around the marketing article circuit for years. We can offer  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  individualized business coaching </a>  tailored to your business goals and unique situation, but for the masses, we&rsquo;d also like to clarify a few points.</p><h3> Search Engine Marketing</h3><p> <br/> Though an &ldquo;old dinosaur&rdquo; of digital marketing, Search has always been a powerful player in traffic generation and conversions. The cost of Google Adwords PPC keeps going up as a result of fierce keyword competition, but Search still takes the lion&rsquo;s share of most businesses&rsquo; marketing budget. Yet, we also see the shift toward more paid social starting to happen.</p><h3> Pros:</h3><li> Most people entering terms into the search engine are interested in making a purchase.</li><li> Google Customer Match makes it easier for brands to zero-in on their target audience.</li><li> Customers are drawn to a company&rsquo;s site, rather than direct advertising, which can feel pushy.</li><li> Paid ads are easy to set up, even if you have very limited time and expertise. <br/>  </li><h3> Cons:</h3><li> There&rsquo;s no guarantee that the person clicking on your ad will become a customer.</li><li> Competitors can try to sabotage your advertising campaign by clicking on your ad and using up your budget.</li><li> The cost of bidding can become expensive if you do not have a PPC strategy and an experienced PPC manager running your campaigns. <br/>  </li><h3> <img alt=\"Marketing spend trends\" src=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Digital_Spend.png\"/></h3><p> Image Source:  <a href=\"http://www.webstrategiesinc.com/blog/marketing-budgets-much-spend-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  WebStrategiesInc.com </a></p><h3> Social Media Marketing</h3><p> <br/> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cmo.com/articles/2014/1/14/15_stats_B2B_marketers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CMO study  </a> </u>  found that 54% of B2B marketers said they&rsquo;ve used social media to generate leads. What brands love about social networks is the multitude of creative ways they can tell their brand story to generate enthusiasm, love and loyalty among existing customers and prospects. Measuring total impact can be challenging, but investments in social media have consistently grown each year.</p><h3> Pros:</h3><li> Much demographic information about your audience is provided for you, including age, birthday, location, interests, friends, work and recent online activity.</li><li> Word-of-mouth advertising is pretty much a given, with the ease of sharing endorsement information on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. In fact, research shows that  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/reports/habits-and-motivations-of-consumers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  75% of the 18-26 demographic  </a> have made purchases based on social media recommendations.</li><li> It&rsquo;s easy to quickly spot and respond to any negative press.</li><li> Social signals help with Search Engine Optimization.</li><li> Pinterest referrals spend 70% more than visitors <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a> from non-social channels like search.</li><li> More marketers are planning to increase spending on social media than search this year.</li><li> Regular interactions with your brand on social media platforms nurtures brand loyalty. According to  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/30-statistics-how-social-media-influence-purchasing-decisions-infographic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Social Media Today </a> , 71% of consumers are more likely to make purchase decisions based on social media interactions with brands.</li><li> Social media offers many ways to retarget and win back wayward customers. <br/>  </li><h3>  Cons:</h3><li> Not all consumers are active on social media, so you could be missing your target completely or missing a huge pool of constituents, depending on your industry and clientele.</li><li> Social network users are not explicitly on the site to buy, so you need to do a bit more work for your conversions.</li><li> Social media can be a time drain, with 64% of digital marketers on social media for more than six hours a day.</li><li> In the absence of direct conversions, true impact can be difficult for brands to measure on social media. <br/>  </li><h3> <img alt=\"marketing spending plans\" src=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marketing-spending-plans.png\"/></h3><p> Image Source:  <a href=\"http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/2015-marketing-budget-trends-by-channel-49517/attachment/strongview-2015-marketing-budget-plans-by-program-dec2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  MarketingCharts.com </a></p><h3> The Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> The easy answer is to invest some resources into both modes of advertising. As Wealth Management Magazine contends, paid, owned and earned media are crucial to a successful marketing mix these days.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a small business starting out, putting more money into search is worth your while because it&rsquo;s easy to gain traction and begin converting sales. For a small company, an investment of $1,000 in Google Ads over a six-month period can go a long way. However, you can maximize the reach of a few hundred dollars each month by paying to play on social media as well.</p><p> INC also recommends hiring a marketing firm at approximately $4,000 a month to see generous returns over the next six months. Small Biz Trends echoes that it&rsquo;s almost always &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; to invest in a social media consultant and social media advertising. There are many ways to think about social media investment for the first time, but it will probably involve sinking money into strategy, site development, content, channel management, campaigning, and monitoring.</p><p> More established firms are expected to have a fresh social media presence. Word-of-mouth love on social networks goes a long way in lowering the cost of customer acquisition by fostering more brand loyalty among repeat customers.</p><p> Need more help developing your strategy and deciding on a budget?

{"original_id":3612,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Surprising Cost of Toxic Employees","link":"the-surprising-cost-of-toxic-employees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scedmonds\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   S. Chris Edmonds  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://drivingresultsthroughculture.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Purposeful Culture Group  </u> </a></p><p> We&rsquo;ve all experienced toxic players in our organizational culture. Whether those toxic people are leaders or team members, their self-serving behaviors erode trust, respect, and dignity in every interaction.</p><p> They also cost organizations money.</p><p> It makes sense that those toxic players cost money, but until now, we didn&rsquo;t have data to support that assumption. Now we do.</p><h3> The ROI of Firing a Toxic Employee</h3><p> <br/> A recent working paper by Michael Housman and Dylan Minor of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/16-057_d45c0b4f-fa19-49de-8f1b-4b12fe054fea.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business School  </a> </u>  shares the results of their study of toxic workers. They were given access to employment data on nearly 60,000 workers at 11 companies. The researchers&rsquo; primary focus was on conduct that caused the toxic employee to be terminated.</p><p> The study found that a superstar performer &mdash; one that models desired values and contributes consistent performance &mdash; brings in over $5,300 in cost savings to a company. Avoiding a toxic hire &mdash; or letting a toxic hire go promptly &mdash; brings in over $12,400 in cost savings. That&rsquo;s more than double the benefit of your superstar!</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/11/those-toxic-co-workers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Minor  </a> </u>  says that the cost savings of avoiding a toxic hire is actually higher when you include savings from decreased productivity due to low morale, as well as avoiding litigation and regulatory penalties caused by the toxic player&rsquo;s behavior over time.</p><h3> How Toxic Employees Affect Morale</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve experienced a number of toxic players in organizations where I&rsquo;ve worked over the years.</p><p> One was a salesperson who regularly arranged clients to purchase goods and services at the end of the quarter, only to return those goods &mdash; or cancel the services &mdash; at the start of the next quarter. The net result was no cost to the customer, but the salesperson got credit for the big sales at quarter&rsquo;s end. The salesperson was paid commissions and bonuses on those sales, regularly.</p><p> I learned to insulate myself from this salesperson. I didn&rsquo;t want to be tainted by his self-serving actions.</p><p> Another was a boss of mine. In my nonprofit days, we held annual support campaigns to raise money from our communities to fund our programs. In my first year as branch executive, our team raised over $25,000, more than double what that branch had ever raised before.</p><p> At the campaign&rsquo;s closing dinner for all eight branches, my volunteer board chairperson and I were excited to present our results. A few minutes before our presentation, my boss walked up and pulled me aside. He said, &ldquo;You raised $25,000 so far, right?&rdquo; I nodded. &ldquo;I want you to announce that you raised $30,000.&rdquo;</p><p> I stuttered, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t raised $30,000. We&rsquo;ve raised $25,000.&rdquo;</p><p> He said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll continue raising funds through the year. Announce $30,000.&rdquo; He walked away.</p><p> We announced our actual total. My boss was not happy. And I realized that the values my boss lived by were quite different from my own. I got out of that job as soon as I could.</p><h3> Why Companies Are Afraid to Let Go</h3><p> <br/> You have experienced toxic players in your careers, as well. Why do organizations tolerate toxic behavior?</p><p> It may be because the leaders don&rsquo;t want to have that difficult conversation. So they do nothing. It may be that the toxic player is a high performer (not at all unusual) and the leaders don&rsquo;t want to lose that contribution to the organization&rsquo;s results and bottom line. So they do nothing. It may be that leaders have had those difficult conversations, yet toxic players continue to behave badly.

{"original_id":3613,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Embracing Disruption","link":"embracing-disruption","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrjake74\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jake Chambers  </u> </a></p><p> The disruption facing whole industries and their incumbents, driven by changing customer needs and fuelled by technology, is well-known and well-covered. The impact on financial services is still nascent, but most people agree it will grow and transform the sector. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essential to embrace the change and nurture the talent that will lead it.</p><p> Innovation drives competition, and competition demands innovation. This cycle has always existed, but now it&rsquo;s shorter than ever before. It is pushing industries harder, be that banking, utilities, telecoms or heath and fitness; industries Daryl and I have experience in and follow carefully. No product, service, process or technology is sacred. Wherever a new or latent need exists, it&rsquo;s just a matter of (not very much) time until someone will come up with a solution. Embracing change will secure the future of businesses, differentiate brands, and result in success for the leaders who adapt.</p><h3> Collaboration is the name of the game</h3><p> <br/> The model of closed innovation in secretive R&amp;D facilities, favoured by many large and traditional corporations, is also being challenged. Today the internet, social media and crowdfunding enable tiny organisations and ambitious individuals to raise money, find talent and resources and develop their own ideas. Innovation and business evolution have become team sports. Even Apple buys various pieces of the puzzle that make up its products from other businesses, including outsourcing the actual manufacturing. In such creative and fast-moving ecosystems, innovation thrives through collaboration, providing access to the best talent, intelligence and resources from across the whole market, not just in that organisation.</p><h3> From little acorns&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The number of start-ups in the UK rocketed to over 580,000 in 2014, and this is powering further change, as established companies start to offer start-ups the help they need to grow and prosper, with the reciprocal benefit of the start-ups introducing the incumbents to new and exciting growth opportunities.</p><p> These initiatives - including Accelerators and Incubators - share the objective of bringing together traditional firms and new thinkers for mutually beneficial partnerships, but there are some differences:</p><li> Incubators offer a nurturing space for the development of an idea, giving a start-up the space and time to develop its ideas within a like-minded community for as long as it takes.</li><li> Accelerators provide a more rigid structure of education with targets and milestones against which to grow a project. Accelerator programmes often conclude with a &ldquo;deal day&rdquo; or pitch, in which the start-up uses the skills they have learned to win customers or secure investment. Accenture&rsquo;s FinTech Innovation Lab in the banking industry is a prime example. <br/>  </li><h3> The UK: global FinTech leaders</h3><p> <br/> Turning to a market we have recently been immersed in, retail banking, all this holds true: the global investment in FinTech ventures from this sector tripled to over $12 billion in 2014. The UK and Ireland are at the forefront of this, accounting for 42 per cent of the European FinTech investment &ndash; worth a reported &pound;20 billion to the UK economy this year alone. And as we edge in front in Europe, we&rsquo;re also predicted to become global leaders before too long. As Eileen Burbidge, partner at early stage venture fund Passion Capital and the Mayor of London's tech ambassador, has pointed out, this is in no small part due to London&rsquo;s unique ability to combine technological innovation with finance and policy making &ndash; all within the city walls. Innovation is more than a series of great ideas &ndash; to become impactful it relies on the development of those ideas into compelling propositions that drive growth &ndash; and this is where London&rsquo;s combination of creativity and solid financial service foundations enables it to steal a march.</p><p> With this backdrop, and the conditions ripe for disruption, the future of FinTech is exciting. Funding Circle, World Remit and TransferWise have already netted investment totalling more than a combined &pound;300 million in 2015, and there are plenty more FinTech entrepreneurs hot on their heels. Many financial institutions are trying to improve, or arguably secure, their futures by backing such FinTech start-ups, through collaborating and co-investing. These efforts often rely on the Incubators and Accelerators I described above, where the focus is on nurturing talent and giving start-ups the platforms to showcase their products. The weakness in this approach is that it is outside-in: the start-ups offer a solution but it typically wasn&rsquo;t designed to address a challenge explicitly set and prioritised by the &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo;. It is a hit-and-miss approach to innovation.</p><p> This is where the Innovation Lab comes in to focus. Innovation Labs are the creative spaces within traditional organisations where new ideas are formed, unconstrained by day-to-day operational business priorities. But, importantly, the ideas that are formed in labs should be purposefully and explicitly focused on challenges that the organisation has prioritised. Some businesses have built their own labs, others have outsourced this capability. A few are starting to adopt a third way: open innovation, owned and led by their own people but augmented by external experts with experience of doing this before and a network of partners beside them.</p><p> Which option is the right one depends on what role innovation has in an organisation&rsquo;s strategic objectives, and its strengths, assets and talent to deliver these in-house. Organisations that are great at spotting future growth champions might be well-placed to run Incubators and Accelerators offering investment. Companies with dominant market positions or advantageous access to resources might be better off by keeping innovation in-house and closed.  But for many, access to a much wider pool of talent and fresh ideas, the opportunity to share resources and the stimulating exposure to competition is likely to make open innovation an increasingly attractive option.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-13 17:33:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-13 17:33:47.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/embracing-disruption/\", \"post_id\": \"8000\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-13 17:33:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-13 17:33:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"embracing-disruption\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7999\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3738\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/embracing-disruption.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"577\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450116000,"author_id":129,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3614,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"It's That Time of Year: Change Is on the Horizon","link":"its-that-time-of-year-change-is-on-the-horizon","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It&rsquo;s almost the end of another year. (How does time fly so darned fast?!) If you&rsquo;re anything like me, the looming New Year means it&rsquo;s time to get your act together, makeresolutions, and do what you need for a fresh start to 2016.</h3><p> <br/> Of course, the usual culprits come to mind&mdash; diet and fitness, clean out my refrigerator, and get that bag of stuff to Goodwill. But this year it goes deeper for me. The time is ripe for some bigger changes.</p><p> Yesterday, when I let my mind start to go there, I was instantly overwhelmed. My brain was cluttered with 50 things I&rsquo;d love to accomplish now to make some real changes in my life by January. And with all those ideas bombarding me, I felt immediately weighed down and&hellip;stuck.</p><p> As I tried to figure out a way to move forward, I remembered a fantastic article I read in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/david-allen-on-how-to-fix-your-life/263883/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Atlantic  </a> </u> &mdash;an interview with David Allen, an organizational guru and the author of the best-seller  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449511267&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=get+things+done\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Getting Things Done: the Art of Stress-Free Productivity  </a> </u> . Allen has been speaking and coaching on the topic of &ldquo;getting things done&rdquo; for years, and his insights and methods are a game changer for anyone who, like me, feels plagued by too many tasks and is desperately seeking more time to do it all.</p><p> One of Allen&rsquo;s most important steps to getting unstuck is to get things out of your head and down on paper. He suggests that by simply writing down the long list of items that are floating around in your mental to-do list, you can free up your mind to start to organize your tasks and accomplish your goals. My friend Linda&mdash;a high achiever who I&rsquo;m guessing, has at least two million ideas and tasks in her head at any given moment&mdash;told me she keeps a small notebook with her everywhere she goes. Why? To write stuff down and get it out of her head. (Others use their smart phones). Whether she got the idea from David Allen or not, it works for her.</p><p> Another tool Allen recommends is to have a physical &ldquo;in-basket&rdquo; for all the stuff you have to handle&mdash;one place to deposit all the myriad things that come into your already cluttered space until it&rsquo;s time to focus on them. When I read this, a light bulb went off in my head. At my office, I have an in-basket, and it works perfectly. But my home is another story. Without a personal in-basket, it seems that every flat surface is a virtual in-basket. A letter from my sister is on the side table (I should have replied last week). A half-scribbled grocery list is on the kitchen counter that begs a trip to the store, right next to a coupon for that new restaurant I want to try, and the empty battery package to remind me to add that to my list. And then there&rsquo;s the invitation to that great speaker series I&rsquo;d love to attend&hellip;over there on the coffee table. The list goes on.</p><p> David Allen isn&rsquo;t alone in his mission to help the overwhelmed (like me!) get it together. A year ago everyone was buzzing about the new book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering/dp/1607747308\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing  </a> </u>  by Marie Kondo. Twelve months have gone by since it hit the bestseller list, and the buzz has only escalated. Every time I turn around, someone tells me their story of how using Kondo&rsquo;s KonMari Method has changed their lives. In truth, I already own the book&mdash;it&rsquo;s sitting on the table with the letter from my sister&mdash;but the type is so darned small it&rsquo;s a chore to read it! Plus, I know deep down that reading it will give me even more things to add to my to-do list. In the introduction (at least I&rsquo;ve gotten that far!), Kondo writes, &ldquo;when you put your house in order, you put your affairs and your past in order too.&rdquo; What a lovely thought. I guess I have some homework to do.</p><p> There are just a few short weeks before January 1, and my mission is to take both David Allenand Marie Kondo&rsquo;s advice and start to simplify my life. I&rsquo;m going to begin writing things down to create &ldquo;mind space&rdquo; by clearing all that messiness out of my head. I&rsquo;m going to set up an in-basket at home to get some control over the tasks that do require action. And I&rsquo;m going to take a closer look at the KonMari Method to begin to get organized. I&rsquo;ll start with organizing my things&hellip;hopefully &ldquo;my affairs, and my past&rdquo; will follow. One can only hope.</p><p> Of course, as a financial advisor, I see financial organizing as an absolute must on any year-end to-do list. Be sure these items are a top priority in the next few weeks so you have them completed by December 31. Other money-related tasks can go into that new in-basket to handle when the time is right in 2016.</p><li> Establish Keogh or Solo 401k plan</li><li> Make 401(k) contributions</li><li> Sell stock to realize gains/losses</li><li> Take Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</li><li> Pay expenses for tax deductions</li><li> Make tax-deductible gifts to charities</li><li> Make annual tax-free gifts</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-13 18:12:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-13 18:12:05.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/its-that-time-of-year-change-is-on-the-horizon/\", \"post_id\": \"8002\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-13 18:12:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-13 18:12:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"its-that-time-of-year-change-is-on-the-horizon\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8001\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3739\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/change-is-on-the-horizon.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"672\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450119600,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3615,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Prepare For An Informal Interview","link":"how-to-prepare-for-an-informal-interview","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Scarlett Wilson | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BubbleJobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   BubbleJobs  </u> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s becoming more and more common for interviewers to try and calm your pre interview nerves by calling it an &lsquo;informal interview&rsquo; &ndash; but what these lovely employers don&rsquo;t understand is that it causes even more stress for terrified graduates entering the working world with little professional interview experience.</p><p> When I came for my first interview at Bubble I was told it was an informal interview. A mad rush of questions instantly entered my head; what do I wear? What questions will they ask? What if I say the wrong thing? So I sympathise with this sudden sense of panic you may be feeling in the pit of your stomach! But not to worry; I&rsquo;ve listed everything you need to know about informal interviews and how to wow your employer.</p><h3> 1. Failing To Prepare Is Preparing To Fail</h3><p> <br/> I thought I&rsquo;d get this one out of the way first. Many of you in the graduate world may hear you have an informal interview and think &lsquo;Great, I&rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about&rsquo;, time to sit back and relax. NO, NO, NO&hellip; If you go into your interview with this casual attitude, it will come across as though you have a casual attitude towards the role, and you don&rsquo;t want that! Make sure your on time and look respectable and ready to boast about yourself!</p><p> Before my interview at Bubble, I researched the company, what they did and how the job role would suit me &ndash; this way I was sure I could answer their questions. But don&rsquo;t worry too much; your employer isn&rsquo;t expecting you to know every tiny detail. That said we&rsquo;re an extremely lucky generation as we have Google at our finger tips, so there&rsquo;s no excuse graduates!!</p><p> So&hellip; before your interview, get your notepad, tablet, phone (whatever you fancy) and write (or type) down the key information you need to know about the company and make sure you can talk about it freely &ndash; this way you won&rsquo;t sound like a robot.</p><h3> 2. Make Sure You Match Your Skills With The Job Description</h3><p> <br/> Even though your employer is saying it&rsquo;s an informal interview there&rsquo;s a strong chance that they want to discover whether your skills match the job description. So&hellip; get the job description in front of you and highlight the key skills that are necessary &ndash; then make sure that you can boast about your talents in relation to those skills.</p><p> If you find that you don&rsquo;t have all the requirements necessary, don&rsquo;t just brush it under the carpet and think it will go away, it won&rsquo;t! Make sure you have an answer ready &ndash; the employer won&rsquo;t expect you to know everything &ndash; after all, you&rsquo;re a graduate just beginning your journey. But if you can explain how you&rsquo;ll attempt to enhance your skills it shows that you use your initiative rather than just expecting people to sit you down and teach you.</p><h3> 3. Be Engaging</h3><p> <br/> With any interview an employer wants to see what your personality is like but even more so in an informal interview. So make sure that you&rsquo;re personable by smiling and engaging in questions and conversation with the interviewer.</p><p> You may have all the right qualifications and experience but if you have a face like grumpy dwarf you&rsquo;re most likely not going to get the job. Employers are looking for a good worker (obviously) but they also want to know that you&lsquo;ll fit in with the employees and are able to boost morale when times may get stressful. So smile and be chatty (which shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard).</p><h3> 4. Keep Some Kind Of Guard Up</h3><p> <br/> This said don&rsquo;t relax too much! Many interviews may choose an informal interview to evaluate what you&rsquo;re like when you&rsquo;re relaxed. Make sure you avoid those bad habits slipping out, like; lateness, swearing, slouching and fidgeting</p><p> Make sure you still act professionally and don&rsquo;t let the excitement of the interview take over and become similar to an excitable puppy! Rein it in a little bit if you know you have a big character.</p><h3> 5. What Do I Wear?!</h3><p> <br/> At the end of your conversation about your interview, the employer might slip in that it&rsquo;s a casual dress code &ndash; another problem to add to your list. Sorry!</p><p> Try not to take the term too literally, if you turn up in your hoody and tracksuit bottoms you&rsquo;re probably not going to give off the best first impression. So take a look at our blog, on how to master the &ldquo;casual&rdquo; job interview to discover exactly what you should be wearing to that key interview!</p><p> Ok, so you go; my top five tips on how to keep your cool and win over your employer at an informal interview.</p><p> Have I missed anything out?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-13 20:17:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-13 20:17:22.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-prepare-for-an-informal-interview/\", \"post_id\": \"8004\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-13 20:17:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-13 20:17:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-prepare-for-an-informal-interview\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8003\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3740\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-To-Prepare-For-An-Informal-Interview.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1001\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450124100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

What better time than at year end when they are winding up the year, AND planning for 2016? What do you know about their successes and losses this year that you can add, expand upon or improve? Your knowledge of their business is the gift that can keep on giving to both you and your client. Start the process out with a little gift &ndash; like a year-end review meeting over lunch or dinner.

Lots of us! Particularly when we think we&rsquo;ve gone there before or know we can figure it out on the way. But with prospecting, the more focused and targeted you can be, the better results you will have. So what are the categories of targets you want to touch? You need a prospecting plan that includes a set of well-defined targets, a multi-touch approach that is mapped out, and an execution schedule that covers all the touches and follow-up you need to complete the entire journey.</p><h3> The Third Day of Prospecting &ndash; Don&rsquo;t Wait to Go Shopping Until the Last Minute</h3><p> <br/> When is the best time to start prospecting? When you don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;need&rdquo; the leads. Wait a minute &ndash; don&rsquo;t we always need leads? Absolutely. But the level of urgency can often dictate when and how much effort you put into your prospecting activities. Many of us don&rsquo;t even think of prospecting at year end because we&rsquo;re so busy trying to close what we have. Often that means trying to pull deals into the end of this year, leaving Q1 of 2016 pretty light. The time to start is now &ndash; see the First and Second Day above! If, by year end, you have scheduled time with your existing clients, and have developed an actionable prospecting plan for kicking off in January, you are well on your way to a strong first quarter and a habit that will keep you focused on new business throughout the year.</p><h3> The Fourth Day of Prospecting &ndash; Tell a Story that Will Get Their Attention</h3><p> <br/> The most effective prospecting efforts require knowing exactly who your best targets are &ndash; and tailoring your message. Share a story that is relevant and invite them to contribute to that story. Customizing your value proposition by target type will help your engagement in a big way. Think about the clothes you got as gifts last year&hellip;any of them one-size-fits all? Did they fit? Probably not! Look at your top three targets and define what the value prop message needs to be for each of them. It may require some massaging of a core message, or you might have one or two significantly different statements. The goal is for each story to be not only worth telling, but worth listening to.</p><h3> The Fifth Day of Prospecting &ndash; Look at Your Lists and Check Them Twice</h3><p> <br/> The next step is preparing your lists to be sure that you are clear on who you want to reach out to. Places to go for lists include your customer list, your current prospects (including the list of prospects that you didn&rsquo;t close this year), and last but not least, your LinkedIn database. Using these lists, you can cross check to see who knows who, and to gather names of new prospects that you want to add to your 2016 efforts. If you are targeting specific companies, then look at key titles. If you are targeting specific individuals that you know you want to work with, look at their company or business to see what connections you can make. Separate lists are good &ndash; but integrated lists yield better results.</p><h3> The Sixth Day of Prospecting &ndash; Go Caroling with a Friend</h3><p> <br/> Any prospecting plan worth its salt must include a Referral Network strategy that helps you get to target prospects through others.  Make this a &ldquo;spirit of giving&rdquo; part of your plan where you not only look for referrals, but also offer some in exchange. So first, look at your list of targets and research who you know that may have connections to these people. Then next, review the business that your potential referral partners are in &ndash; who do you know that might be interesting to them?  Never ask for a referral without being willing and able to offer one up &ndash; and be the one who &ldquo;hums a few bars&rdquo; first.</p><h3> The Seventh Day of Prospecting &ndash; Remind Your Guests that You&rsquo;ve Invited Them to a Party</h3><p> <br/> How many of us plan a holiday gathering, send out one invite, and have less people there than you planned? The key is to build some momentum and use repetition to get attention and engagement. How many times are you going to touch your prospect, and what are different methods you can use to &ldquo;mix it up&rdquo; a little? Think about how to vary both format and content of the message. Each touch needs to be a little different, as well as offering some more value to demonstrate that talking with you will be useful to them. Plan all your touches in advance, instead of as you go along. You want a cadence of communication that helps drive buyers to your door.</p><h3> The Eighth Day of Prospecting &ndash; Be Strategic on Where You Shop</h3><p> <br/> Consider a section of your plan to focus specifically on one or two very important accounts, with an eye towards prospecting new business and new contacts within each one. Which accounts do you currently have where you know there is more opportunity? This approach has a different twist in that you can apply some Account Based Marketing that will help you increase your penetration of the account and develop new lines of business in other areas of the company. What are the current market issues for this account? How is the account currently handling or planning for their impact? What ideas and offers can you design to help them in these areas? The focus here is to develop a set of highly customized approaches and value props that will really change the conversation you would typically have with a &ldquo;prospect.&rdquo;</p><h3> The Ninth Day of Prospecting &ndash; Bring the Best with You on the Journey</h3><p> <br/> Some leads take much longer than others to pan out. It may be timing, it may be circumstances, or it may be your approach. Before abandoning the leads that just don&rsquo;t close, consider re-looking at them.  Are they fully qualified?  What are the current circumstances in that account? You can retune your value proposition and change up the messaging. Are there any internal personnel changes that may open some other doors? The point here is that you want to be sure that going forward you are bringing those leads that still have value and could be reworked. Re-prospecting your existing lead pool will ensure you don&rsquo;t waste good leads.</p><h3> The Tenth Day of Prospecting &ndash; &lsquo;Tis the Season to Be Social</h3><p> <br/> Another way to mix it up is to go back to your top targets list to see what they are doing in social media. Researching their social outlets can give you some great intelligence that you can bake into a prospecting strategy. Look at their tweets, news blasts, blogs, and even their press releases, to find some nuggets that you can parley into a prospecting approach. Reach out with targeted responses to those social communications that are relevant to demonstrate how you can add value to the conversation. You can add &ldquo;social touches&rdquo; to your overall prospecting approach for selected targets.</p><h3> The Eleventh Day of Prospecting &ndash; Are All Your Gifts Completely Unwrapped?</h3><p> <br/> Do a quick assessment of the prospecting tools you use today. The most effective prospecting programs use an array of tools that work across email, social media and telephone. As you move into the New Year, it&rsquo;s a good time to ask yourself, &ldquo;Am I using them in the best possible way?&rdquo; There may be features that you haven&rsquo;t used yet, or approaches that could be adjusted. Have you used the metrics available with each tool to evaluate performance?Looking at your toolset with fresh eyes is an excellent way to get kick started.</p><h3> The Twelfth Day of Prospecting &ndash; Take Twelve Days and Multiply by Twelve</h3><p> <br/> Now is the time to set your intentions for 2016. Making a commitment to upgrade your prospecting approach can be as simple as multiplying 12 days by 12 months &ndash; giving you 144 days of prospecting for the year. Does that seem like a lot? Absolutely &ndash; and if you want to not only beat but exceed your goals, it takes a commitment like this. If you complete all the activities represented in days 1 &ndash; 11, then you are ready to have the best prospecting year yet! Don&rsquo;t wait to prepare, don&rsquo;t wait till you &ldquo;have time,&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t wait until the urgency for leads is high. Your twelve days starts now!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-13 21:20:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-13 21:20:07.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-twelve-days-of-prospecting/\", \"post_id\": \"8006\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-13 21:20:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-13 21:20:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-twelve-days-of-prospecting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8005\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3741\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12-days-of-prospecting.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"712\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450105200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

They Haven't Even Begun ...","link":"mobile-wallet-wars-they-havent-even-begun","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Looking back on 2015, it&rsquo;s obvious that blockchain was the big focus as mentioned last week.</h3>There were other things though, particularly the increasingly intriguing wallet wars.  Mobile wallet wars have been bubbling for a while, with stagnant attempts to achieve something from the likes of O2 and Orange.<li> <u>  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2012/04/let-the-mobile-wallet-wars-begin.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Let the mobile wallet wars begin  </a> </u> , April 2012</li><li> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/08/wallet-wars-havent-really-started-yet-.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Wallet wars haven't really started yet ...  </u>  , </a>  August 2014</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"/fintech/mobile-wallet-wars-apple-pay-vs-samsung-pay-vs-android-pay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mobile wallet wars: Apple Pay vs Samsung Pay vs Android Pay  </a> </u> , August 2015</li>Barclays Pingit livened the game a bit, then we got Apple Pay and &hellip; things still stagnated.  Some say Apple Pay is not working.  I just believe it&rsquo;s just not found its comfort zone yet.  Now that we have Samsung, Android, Chase and more entering the fray are things going to change much next year?  I reckon they will.So the key to all this is the comfort zone.  What is the comfort zone for a mobile wallet?  It&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s easier to use the wallet than a card or cash.  I personally have not found the reason for using a mobile wallet yet, as card and cash is easier.  When you get to the checkout, if you have to get your mobile out to pay then, in my case, my cards are in my mobile case and I just get the card out.  After all, entering a PIN or fingerprint on my phone makes it just as hard as entering a PIN or touching the contactless payment on the terminal.  So I use the card.Meanwhile a friend of mine is a dedicated Apple Watch fan &ndash; I&rsquo;m not, got one and never use it (not even to tell the time) &ndash; and he loves it as it&rsquo;s contactless and so can tough and go across all of London without touching a card or PIN.  So that&rsquo;s a comfort zone factor.  In fact, the real focal point of the comfort zone is when there&rsquo;s a reason over and above other form factors to use the mobile wallet.<h3> Convenience is one.</h3>If it&rsquo;s easier to touch and go with a watch than a card or phone, then the form factor works.<h3> Security is another motivation.</h3>If it feels more secure using a fingerprint than a PIN, then that is a motivator for changing form factors.<h3> Loyalty is a key factor.</h3>If I get increased rewards using the mobile wallet over the card or cash forms of payment, then that&rsquo;s a motivator.  The challenge there is making the reward system relevant to me.  For example, giving me increasing returns on the things you know I buy rather than services I never use.  A bank knows what those are, as you know where I spend money most frequently.<h3> Savings is another.</h3>Unlike a reward scheme, discounting for using mobile wallets makes people change behaviours.  We saw that in London with the launch of the Oyster card, where cheaper journeys made millions move rapidly to the new payment scheme.  It had convenience too, but discount journeys were the major motivator.Even with all these factors though, something&rsquo;s missing.  Something.  What is it?<h3> Experience.</h3>You need a differentiated experience.  Simple, fun, integrated, useful and preferred are the keys here, and these are best exemplified by Starbucks, Uber and few others.  In fact, there are very few mobile wallet payment schemes that really work, but the Starbucks app is the one that most focus upon.  I include Uber, purely because the ease of a journey where no cash is involved &ndash; in fact, no payment is involved &ndash; is my sort of experience.<h3> Starbucks&rsquo; process seven million weekly transactions from 13 million mobile users, growing at 50 per cent annually and, tellingly, Starbucks processed 90% of all mobile payments in 2013.  What is Starbucks&rsquo; secret sauce?</h3>Simplicity, utility, relevance along with convenience, loyalty, savings and a great user experience.  Above all of these, I would add queue jumping, but that&rsquo;s just me.So these are all things that need to be consider by Apple, Samsung, Google, Chase and more as they roll-out mobile wallet services, and this may prove to be the most interesting area to watch in 2016.","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-14 15:10:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-14 15:10:05.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/mobile-wallet-wars-they-havent-even-begun/\", \"post_id\": \"8008\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-14 15:10:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-14 15:10:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"mobile-wallet-wars-they-havent-even-begun\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8007\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3742\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mobile-Wallet-Wars.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"889\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450175400,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3618,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Pitch Deck Tools that Make an Investor's Life Easy","link":"8-pitch-deck-tools-that-make-an-investors-life-easy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Pitch decks are straightforward and simple enough documents. At least they should be. Imaginative people are always trying to come up with something better and  <a href=\"http://thestartupvideos.com/video-tips/10-steps-to-avoid-in-any-pitch-deck-presentation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  cooler </a>  than a slideshow, but so far, nada. Really, the simplicity of slides with a few bullet points, images, and graphs can&rsquo;t be beat.</p><p> At least not until the day when your  <u>  hologram </u>  can give the presentation for you.</p><h3> Which leads to this important point. The investors who will be viewing your pitch deck &mdash; in whatever form &mdash; expect it to be easy, intuitive, and frictionless.</h3><p> <br/> That is, if your slides don&rsquo;t open, click or format correctly, you&rsquo;re DOA.</p><p> You have to approach your pitch deck with the end user in mind&ndash; what he or she will see. Investors don&rsquo;t care how much time and effort goes into your deck either. They&rsquo;ll judge it the same whether you banged it out over lunch or spent weeks slaving over it.</p><p> The simplicity of a pitch deck means there&rsquo;s no excuse for a technical glitch. That&rsquo;s true whether you&rsquo;re presenting live or sending the deck electronically.</p><h3> <strong>  Email etiquette </strong></h3><p> <br/> Interestingly, some say you should NEVER  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.whiteboardmag.com/how-to-build-a-pitch-deck-that-will-actually-raise-money/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   email  </a> </u>  your pitch deck to an investor in advance. Why? Because investors are busy and it might get lost in a sea of other pitches. Or they&rsquo;ll pick it apart without you there to defend it, resulting in an automatic rejection.</p><p> That may be so, but your pitch deck shouldn&rsquo;t depend on you being there to  <u>  sell it </u> . If it does, you probably made it too complicated. Always have two pitch decks in your arsenal. The first is the minimalist, simple one which you email in advance and present with. The second is the complex one with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Sky7777/the-best-startup-pitch-deck-how-to-present-to-angels-v-cs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   appendixes  </a> </u>  that you follow up with.</p><p> If possible, you want to avoid sending cold emails to investors. They have no extra incentive to open them. Aim for warm emails or even better &mdash; solicited pitches.</p><h3> <strong>  Show your face </strong></h3><p> <br/> To do that, you&rsquo;ll have to tap your network and find out who knows who. If you don&rsquo;t have a network already, start building one. The startup community is small enough in most cities; by simply attending an event, people will notice you.</p><p> What should you do if you&rsquo;re a painful introvert and the thought of meeting strangers freaks you out? Get over it&hellip; ASAP. Networking is a part of every founder&rsquo;s life. Bring a wingman to events, and/or down a few drinks (kombucha?) to get your tongue primed for small talk.</p><p> Eventually, as more people recognize your face, the whole networking thing will be less intimidating. When investors can put your name to a face, your emails will no longer be cold. They&rsquo;ll get  <u>  opened </u> . Start doing this today, so that future fundraising is easier.</p><p> The essence of a pitch deck is simple. You need a program to work in, a presentation medium, and one or two external tools. That&rsquo;s it. Here are your eight pitch deck tools to choose from:</p><h3> Microsoft PowerPoint</h3><p> In the startup world, PowerPoint is ubiquitous. In fact, it&rsquo;s really another word for slideshow. Microsoft is always making little improvements because&hellip;well, they have to (they charge a subscription fee). Powerpoint&rsquo;s biggest advantage is that it works without an internet connection (No WiFi? No problem!).</p><p> <strong>  Pros </strong></p><li> Trust factor. You won&rsquo;t have to battle a firewall while setting up your presentation</li><li> Not dependent on an internet connection <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons </strong></p><li> Travel. You&rsquo;ll have to bring a laptop or a USB stick</li><li> Lacks a commenting feature for email files</li><li> Dependent on end user having Office installed for best viewing <br/>  </li><h3> Apple Keynote</h3><p> As you would expect from an Apple program, the fonts are rich and the templates are best-in-class. Some investors will notice and appreciate the visual bonus. Using Keynote allows you to click through slides using your iPhone&hellip; upping your cool factor by approximately 10. Don&rsquo;t forget, investors dig  <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/11/kanye-west-silicon-valley-clique/ben-horowitzz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  cool people </a> .</p><p> <strong>  Pros </strong></p><li> Better looking fonts and design</li><li> Click through slides using your iPhone</li><li> Easy device transport (no laptop required) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons </strong></p><li> Only works across Apple devices (PDF for all non-Apple toys) <br/>  </li><h3> Google Slides</h3><p> This is a cloud-based free program, open to anyone with a Google account. It works like PowerPoint (with fewer templates) and can be saved in PowerPoint or PDF.</p><li> Device independent (access Docs from any browser)</li><li> Doesn&rsquo;t need to bypass company firewalls to present</li><li> Embedded links work like a charm</li><li> Comment enabling (helpful if sending deck via email) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons: </strong></p><li> Internet  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/5-reasons-replace-powerpoint-google-slides\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   dependent  </a> </u>  (always have a backup PDF or PowerPoint deck)</li><li> URL shortener is not automatic <br/>  </li><h3> Apache OpenOffice Impress</h3><p> This is a free, open source alternative to PowerPoint. It&rsquo;s a little harder to make slides from the designer&rsquo;s perspective, but most investors will not see any drop off in aesthetics.</p><p> <strong>  Pros: </strong></p><li> Slides can be saved in PowerPoint</li><li> Slides transfer easily to Slideshare (or any other online source) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons: </strong></p><li> Might have firewall issues depending on where you present <br/>  </li><h3> Slideshare</h3><p> This is great for sending a deck over email. You can send it before or after a presentation, using a link (which can be adjusted for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Slideshare/how-to-use-private-uploads-on-slideshare/12-Upload_Get_started_Today\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   privacy  </a> </u> ). Slideshare has a  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.slideshare.net/2014/10/20/5-ways-mobile-presentations-can-help-your-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mobile app  </a> </u>  that makes viewing decks on a phone easy.</p><p> <strong>  Pros </strong></p><li> Internet-based, syncs across all devices <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons </strong></p><li> Internet connection dependent <br/>  </li><h3> Adobe PDF</h3><p> Portable document formats can be created using PowerPoint, Keynote, Slides, or Press. They&rsquo;re instantly recognizable as attachments in email and pose very little threat from viruses.</p><p> <strong>  Pros </strong></p><li> Trusted by investors as an email attachment <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons </strong></p><li> Original file image quality isn&rsquo;t perfect; slight distortions exist</li><li> Navigation menu conflicts with Office&rsquo;s layout <br/>  </li><h3> Screenshot software</h3><p> This would really only come into play post-presentation, if you need to clarify or go over a fine point. It&rsquo;s a GOOD thing if you&rsquo;re using it, because it means the investor hasn&rsquo;t said no.</p><p> There are several free and low-cost options like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jing  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://camstudio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Camstudio  </a> </u>  (not to be confused with Camtasia), and  <u>  <a href=\"https://screencast-o-matic.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Screencast-O-Matic  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Lapel Microphone</h3><p> A microphone only applies (obviously!) if you&rsquo;re presenting in person. The rule is this: if you&rsquo;ll be standing up, you NEED a mic. A lapel mic is the way to go because it&rsquo;s 1) barely visible, and 2) it won&rsquo;t remind anyone in the audience of that morning&rsquo;s drive-thru experience at Wendy&rsquo;s.</p><p> Amazon has a  <u>  truckload </u>  of five-star clip-on mics for under $50.</p><p> <strong>  Let me say a quick word about Prezi. It makes beautiful and interesting presentations but it&rsquo;s NOT appropriate for pitch decks. Investors want to read simple stories in rapid progression, which is why slideshows work.

It's possible that you are just a car accident or driveway fall away from losing everything.  </h3><p> <br/> You may think that having auto and home insurance is all you need to protect yourself from money-grubbing plaintiffs, but you&rsquo;d be wrong, which is the reason you need an umbrella liability policy.  Think you don&rsquo;t need an umbrella because you have nothing to keep dry?  Think again.  What you&rsquo;re worth today isn&rsquo;t all that you have to protect.  A claim greater than your existing auto or homeowner&rsquo;s coverage can allow a claimant to garnish your future income.  Ouch. </p><p> An umbrella policy (a.k.a. liability policy) is designed to offer an extension of coverage above and beyond where your homeowner's or auto policies fall short. Let&rsquo;s say you run a red light and hit a surgeon crossing the street.  The cost to cover injuries and loss of wages amounts to $750k but you only have $100k of auto liability coverage.  Your umbrella policy steps up and covers the extra $650k claim against you.</p><p> Your current net worth and future financial security are well worth the cost of this relatively cheap coverage.  A $1 million policy can be just over $200 a year.  Over time, it's important to make sure that your coverage keeps up with your net worth and income.  If you don't have an umbrella policy, make the call to your auto and home agent.

We&rsquo;re doing ok. &rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I still worry. Look, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;</p><p> With some prompting, Sharon admitted that growing up in a divorced family where money was scarce made &ldquo;money worry&rdquo; her constant companion. While Pete knew her family story, Sharon had never articulated its impact on her thinking. Pete quickly began to unlock why they had constant battles about money.</p><p> These conversations happen regularly in the offices of Financial Life Planners, but when left to your own devices? Not so much.</p><p> Consider how powerful and meaningful it would be to talk about all aspects of money freely. To have evolving discussions with your partner that center on your values and projects vital to your happiness. To create magical and meaningful conversations with your partner.</p><p> Here are the six steps you need to create your own &ldquo;non-judgment zone&rdquo; to talk about money&mdash;and a few questions to get your conversations flowing:</p><li> Find a space that is comfortable and private. You don&rsquo;t want to attempt these conversations in the middle of your favorite restaurant where interruptions are guaranteed.</li><li> Set a time limit to no more than 30-45 minutes. Like most sensitive topics, taking these discussions in small doses is a great way to start.</li><li> Create guidelines. For example: no interrupting while the other person is speaking; sticking to one topic; acknowledging when negative judgments are occurring&mdash;and taking a break or ending the conversation.</li><li> Be honest. In a non-judgment zone, there is no need for self-protection and embellishments. After all, there&rsquo;s no point in this discussion if you&rsquo;re not prepared to speak the truth.</li><li> Have a list of topics to discuss (see below for a few to get you started). It&rsquo;s best to begin with money history&mdash;understanding your partner&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; can reveal their deep set beliefs around money. You might know he or she grew up in a wealthy or impoverished home, but not aware of how that experience shades their current beliefs and behaviors.</li><li> Take turns talking and listening. Each session should give each of you an opportunity to share, ask clarifying questions and listen deeply to what is being said. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Discussion Questions </strong></p><p> These are just a few to get the conversation flowing. You might find that under the proper circumstances, you can have real discussions that benefit you and those you love.</p><p> What was your first memory about money?</p><p> What lessons did you learn about money growing up?</p><p> What was the first purchase you made with money you earned? How did it feel?</p><p> Did you consider your family: wealthy/middle class/poor?</p><p> What lessons did you learn from each parent about money?</p><p> Do you see yourself as a &ldquo;spender&rdquo; or a &ldquo;saver&rdquo;?</p><p> Do you worry about money or do you avoid money issues?</p><p> What&rsquo;s been your experience with money conversations?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-14 19:11:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-14 19:11:31.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dirty-talk-a-guide-to-creating-meaningful-money-discussions/\", \"post_id\": \"8014\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-14 19:11:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-14 19:11:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dirty-talk-a-guide-to-creating-meaningful-money-discussions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8013\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3748\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Money-Discussions.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"789\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450188000,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

Too many of us fail to plan out our day. Not having a plan is an excuse to fail. </li></li><li> <strong>  Lack of concrete goals </strong> <li>  Make your goals magnetic, so they pull you toward them; and make them achievable. Brian Tracy is right when he says that a goal not written down is not a goal. It&rsquo;s a fantasy. </li></li><li> <strong>  Fear of rejection </strong> <li>  While fear of rejection may have to do with shyness, it ultimately stems from a poor self-image. </li></li><li> <strong>  Poor verbal skills </strong> <li>  Saying the words is not the same as telling the story. You don&rsquo;t need a hundred sales ideas. Get two or three sales ideas and tell them over and over and over until you&rsquo;re so good you&rsquo;re great at it. </li></li><li> <strong>  Poor selling skills </strong> <li>  Too many Advisors don&rsquo;t know how to sell. They never get good at it because they just don&rsquo;t like to sell. </li></li><li> <strong>  Poor powers of persuasion </strong> <li>  You are asking strangers to ignite their trust in you and reignite their trust in the system. Without passionate persuasion, this is not going to happen. </li></li><li> <strong>  Poor relationship building skills </strong> <li>  As Advisors we have to decide if we want to manage money or manage relationships. Today&rsquo;s clients want a lot more than just profits. </li></li><li> <strong>  Not referable </strong> <li>  Would you want to do business with you? Do you believe in yourself? </li></li><li> <strong>  No repeatable process </strong> <li>  For some strange reason, Financial Advisors don&rsquo;t feel the need to practice. </li></li><li> <strong>  Poor decision making </strong> <li>  Decisions drive actions. Actions produce results. Those who make poor decisions will not last.  <br/>    </li></li><p> Connelly says all of these traps are avoidable and that greatness is there for anyone willing to invest the time, patience and practice: &ldquo;The first step to greatness is deciding to become great,&rdquo; he says, adding that the second step is to seek help, while the third is for the adviser to refine his or her &lsquo;core competency&rsquo;. According to a colleague of Connelly, an adviser&rsquo;s core competency is talking &ndash; in front of clients, on the telephone and at seminars, etc.</p><h3> It may be possible to be born with innate talent. It is impossible to be born with innate skills&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> He advocates that by learning how to run a more efficient business the adviser will have more time to devote to their core competency. He adds that if advisers don&rsquo;t increase the time they spend in front of clients and prospective clients, proper coaching can help improve their prospecting, verbal and selling skills.</p><p> &ldquo;Get out there and build yourself a repeatable process&rdquo; urges Connelly. &ldquo;Sharpen your skills until they are second to none. It may be possible to be born with innate talent. It is impossible to be born with innate skills. Skills must be developed over time.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-14 19:16:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-14 19:16:29.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ten-reasons-advisers-fail-and-what-to-do-about-it/\", \"post_id\": \"8016\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-14 19:16:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-14 19:16:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ten-reasons-advisers-fail-and-what-to-do-about-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8015\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3749\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Why-Advisors-Fail.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"563\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450212300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3622,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Great Expectations: 4 Ways The Needs and Sophistication of Advisors and Their Clients Have Evolved the Industry","link":"great-expectations-4-ways-the-needs-and-sophistication-of-advisors-and-their-clients-have-evolved-the-industry","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Advisors &ndash; whether they sit within traditional firms as employees or are owners of independent practices &ndash; have expectations that are far different today than they were just 5 years ago.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s environment, clients expect their advisor to serve them in a greatly expanded role, evolving from stockbroker to financial advisor to Chief Financial Officer of their entire lives. As the clients&rsquo; needs and expectations have evolved, the advisors have responded in kind, raising their own expectations of themselves and of the firms they work for. No longer operating blindly as loyal &ldquo;company men and women,&rdquo; advisors recognize that they have many legitimate options from which to choose. It&rsquo;s this powerful combination that has resulted in advisors raising the standards &ndash; for what they need &ndash; and want &ndash; for their business lives, and a willingness to solve for what they find lacking.</p><p> To be sure, consider the following:</p><li> <strong>  Advisors think like business owners </strong> <br/> They want the flexibility and autonomy to control how they run their practices, as well as to control the client experience, deciding the best service model along with the right wealth management approach. Thinking like a business owner also means they want to monetize their life&rsquo;s work by way of one or multiple liquidity event(s), or to reinvest in the business by acquiring another book, thereby positioning themselves for additional growth. This also means that they want to provide continuity for their clients by controlling when and to whom they will pass the torch, creating the next generation of the business.</li><li> <strong>  Advisors are more confident in the strength of their personal relationships with their clients </strong> <br/> Advisors believe they provide a unique value as they help clients achieve life goals&mdash;a far cry from the primary role of &ldquo;stockbroker&rdquo; a few years ago. Since clients value the personal relationship with their advisor &ndash; and are less likely to see them as an interchangeable commodity &ndash; advisors feel a responsibility to identify a successor for their business. They are no longer content to have their assets divvied up by someone else, or to simply walk away at the end of their career. The dilemma is that advisors aren&rsquo;t confident that the right successor will actually be found at the appropriate time. Given the aging advisor population and the overall shortage of next generation talent (who have a multitude of options from which to choose), firms and individual advisors are competing for a scarce and increasingly valuable supply of appropriate successors.</li><li> <strong>  Technology is critical </strong> <br/> Advisors incorporate technology into every aspect of their lives. They expect efficient, reliable and intuitive capabilities that allow them to remain competitive. They also want access to products and the other resources their clients have come to expect, with as close to open architecture as is allowable. Advisors want to be able to communicate with clients, prospects and team members using every vehicle available &ndash; including social media &ndash; whether they are in the office or not. Advisors also want to meet their clients&rsquo; growing expectations for high quality, easily accessible, and fully comprehensive statements and reports. All this allows advisors to deliver a high touch, yet scalable, client experience. In essence, they want to incorporate Robo-Advisor technology into their toolboxes, but not be replaced by it.</li><li> <strong>  Near perfection is within reach </strong> <br/> Advisors today have a stronger belief that near perfection is achievable; that they need to settle less in making choices about how best to serve their clients and live their professional lives. They want to enjoy the business again, and they recognize that there are more legitimate options and solutions than ever before.

{"original_id":3623,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Problem with Trying to Help Employees Succeed","link":"the-problem-with-trying-to-help-employees-succeed","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.&rdquo; &mdash;Bruce Lee <br/>  </h3><p> To be successful you must first define what success looks like. Herein lies the problem; success looks different to everyone. So, as a leader, it becomes difficult to help individuals in your organization succeed. What you think of as success may not mean anything to them. And, the way they define success may make no sense to you. The dilemma is that there is no right or wrong way to define success. We know that investing in employees, taking a personal interest in them, and helping them to grow and succeed is one of the most important roles that a leader plays. So, what do we do about the problem of trying to help employees succeed?</p><h3> Respect the differences <br/>  </h3><p> Each individual must find their own definition of success. What does it really look like? Once success is defined, it sets up the expectations that go along with achieving it. As a leader, you can&rsquo;t put your own expectations of success on those who work with you. You must help them define their own expectations and then learn to respect the differences in what it means to succeed.</p><h3> Give them the resources <br/>  </h3><p> Once we know what success looks like, we need to formulate a plan for getting from here to there. As a leader, it is your responsibility to provide the resources that your people need achieve success. This not only requires the resources to succeed, but also to fail on occasion. Failure will always be a stepping stone on the road to success and, as a leader, you need to offer the support and resources that will allow your employees to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and get back on the track to success.</p><h3> Become their cheerleader <br/>  </h3><p> One of the biggest factors in the ability for one to succeed is to be surrounded by others who are supportive, positive motivators. Be a cheerleader for your employees. Provide them with a positive, supportive, and trusting environment where they can pursue their goals. Help them to gain confidence, empower them, and communicate with them openly and often. Provide them with opportunities that will help them grow towards their definition of success.</p><h3> Celebrate small successes <br/>  </h3><p> Celebrate small successes based on what success looks like to them. Help employees to identify what success looks like for them at every step of the journey. Taking that first real step is a small success. Keeping focused and reaching a milestone is a small success. And, reaching the finish line is a, not so small, success.</p><h3> Acknowledge the contribution <br/>  </h3><p> While they are on the road to their own success, acknowledge the contribution that their progress is making to the organization. Has their accountability improved? Are they better team members? Are they setting a good example for others to follow? Has their productivity and/or quality improved? Keep your eyes open for positive changes that are taking place, and then take the time to acknowledge the contribution that your employees are making to that change.</p><p> As a leader, the most important things you can do to help your employees succeed is to help them visualize and define what success means to them. Then, respect the differences, give them the necessary resources, become their cheerleader, help them recognize and celebrate the small successes, and acknowledge the contributions they are making. Real success is not about duplicating someone else&rsquo;s version of success. It&rsquo;s about defining your own goals, your own road, and your own passion. Don&rsquo;t set employees up to fail by projecting your expectations of success on them. Be the support that helps employees identify their own vision of success, their own expectations, and the ability to live up to them and reach their goals.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-14 19:47:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-14 19:47:30.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-problem-with-trying-to-help-employees-succeed/\", \"post_id\": \"8020\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-14 19:47:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-14 19:47:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-problem-with-trying-to-help-employees-succeed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8019\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3751\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Problem-with-trying-to-Help-Employees-Succeed.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"514\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450177200,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

We&rsquo;d just finished a powerful workshop where each of them had identified ways they could make a bigger impact in the their organizations, in the world and in the women leaders coming up behind them. Then over lunch, Laura turned to me and confessed, &ldquo;Karin, I&rsquo;m still having trouble with your  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/confident-humility-an-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   confident humility  </a> </u>  model. I think most women have way too much humility and that actually gets in the way of their success.&rdquo;</p><p> Of course, the whole point of my model is that it&rsquo;s the balance of confidence with humility, but my point was not the point. I needed to hear her story.</p><p> They just filled a really critical role in our organization, and everyone was shocked. &ldquo;We thought it would be you!&rdquo;  I know I&rsquo;m way more qualified than the guy who got it, and I could have added a lot of value. But the truth is, I didn&rsquo;t apply. No one asked me to. I guess, I figured if they wanted me they would have asked.</p><p> She continued,</p><p> I don&rsquo;t think we should be teaching women about the power of humility. I think we need to get them to learn to believe in themselves and tell others why they should believe in them too.</p><p> And then several other women chimed in with similar experiences. One C-level exec shared her observations.</p><p> I think the problem is that many women look at the long list of requirements on a job description and think &ldquo;Shoot, I&rsquo;m missing one, better not apply.&rdquo; Whereas a guy is more likely to say, &ldquo;Ha, look at this, I&rsquo;ve got all but one nailed, I&rsquo;m a shoe-in.&rdquo;</p><p> As I listened, I thought about the many roles I have taken on in my career that were really a stretch. On paper, I was completely under-qualified for these cross-functional assignments. What was the difference? Why did I exude that &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; audacious confidence that made me believe I could be successful without the experience?</p><p> And then it hit me. Much of that confidence came from the fact that one time, one senior leader convinced me I should move out of HR and take on a field role for which I had no experience. He told me he had &ldquo;no doubts&rdquo; that I would be successful. So I put my hat in the ring and was hired. He was right.</p><p> The next time, I didn&rsquo;t need any external convincing.</p><p> Humility has nothing to do with selling yourself short. Humility is about knowing the mission is bigger than you. For goodness sake, if you&rsquo;re the best person for the job, don&rsquo;t stand back and let someone else take the helm.</p><p> And we all need to be on the lookout for women and men, who might need a little extra convincing.</p><h3> Your turn.

{"original_id":3625,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Merge Your Facebook Pages, Profiles, and Other Social Media Accounts","link":"how-to-merge-your-facebook-pages-profiles-and-other-social-media-accounts","source_link":null,"content":"<p> So you, like so many business owners, are about to pull your hair out just thinking about all the duplicate Facebook and Twitter accounts you have.  Perhaps you have two personal profiles on Facebook, 3 different business pages, and a handful of Twitter accounts that you secured early on as your brand was launching. How did this happen? Many businesses rushed to create a Facebook Page or set up a Twitter account before they really knew what to do with them and now they can&rsquo;t remember the passwords or even all the usernames they had secured.You can&rsquo;t just leave these duplicate or old accounts floating out there like satellite junk floating in space. You may think they aren&rsquo;t doing any harm, but when consumers search for your brand, it can be confusing if they find several variations. Unlike sitting on multiple domain names to prevent anyone else from grabbing them, an unused social media account with a similar name is seen to the public and will have your consumers wondering which one they are supposed to connect with. It can dilute your brand&rsquo;s power on social media sites. So what&rsquo;s a person to do?Here is how (and why) to convert a PERSONAL PROFILE on Facebook to a BUSINESS PAGE, as well as how to merge two or more Facebook BUSINESS PAGES or PLACE PAGES that may have even been created by consumers who couldn&rsquo;t find you.  Then we will tackle duplicate Twitter accounts, which are much easier to deal with.</p><h3> Converting A Personal Profile on Facebook to A Business Page</h3>This one is tricky. Facebook wants you to maintain a personal profile to network and connect with other people. They also want you to maintain a personal profile to MANAGE a business page, but there are times when you and your brand are one and the same. Your name is the name of your business. Professional speakers, actors, musicians, sports figures, or other celebrities, might have a personal profile that maxes out at 5,000 connections and so they either allow followers (people can follow updates you post to PUBLIC without actually &ldquo;FRIENDING&rdquo; you. To enable this, go to your GENERAL SETTINGS and look for FOLLOWERS.) or create a business page to allow an unlimited number of fans to join in. Many people in this situation end up creating duplicate content for both sites and then miss messages left for them on one or both.A bigger reason to convert your PERSONAL PROFILE to a BUSINESS PAGE is if you are conducting or promoting a business regularly from a personal profile. It is against <u> Facebook&rsquo;s Terms of Agreement</u> to use a personal profile to conduct business or to represent a business. Sure it&rsquo;s done all the time, but beware, Facebook can (and has) shut down a profile if they discovere it is being used by a business.Before merging or converting accounts you must first ask yourself if you want to use Facebook for personal use. Do you want to connect with your close friends and family members on a different level than you do with your fans and followers? If you answer, NO, then merging (or converting) the two makes sense. If you answer, YES, you do want to use your personal profile, you can put friends and family into lists and find ways to differentiate your personal from your business pages with different images or clear messages to fans to connect on your business page, telling them why they don&rsquo;t want to miss the content that is shared there.If you want to convert your PERSONAL PROFILE and all its friends, family, and fans into a BUSINESS PAGE (fan page) you take one of these two routes:If you do NOT have a current BUSINESS PAGE, follow these steps:<li> First go into your SETTINGS and download a copy of all of your data. You will most likely lose your photos and posts that have been placed on your profile when it converts. You will receive an email with this data.</li><li> All of your FRIENDS from your PERSONAL ACCOUNT will become FANS of your page. If someone has already liked your PAGE, they will only be counted once.</li><li> Be sure to appoint a new GROUP ADMIN to any groups you may manage, since once your PERSONAL PROFILE is gone, the group will be assigned to someone that Facebook selects (usually the most active member-which may not be who you want in control of your group).</li><li> Now to begin the migration,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php?migrate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   start HERE  </a> </u>  at Facebook&rsquo;s Migration page.</li><li> You will not be able to UNDO these two, so be sure to think through your plan before you do this.</li><h3> Merging Two Facebook Business Pages</h3>If you DO have a current BUSINESS PAGE that you want to merge with your PERSONAL PROFILE follow these steps:<li> First go into your SETTINGS and download a copy of all of your data. You could lose your photos and posts that have been placed on your profile when it converts.</li><li> Be sure you are not the only admin on your BUSINESS PAGE. Add another person as a manager or admin before your personal profile (which was most likely the only admin on the page) goes away. This additional admin will be the person who can help you post content and manage your account if needed.</li><li> Go up and follow the steps listed above to first convert your PERSONAL PROFILE to a BUSINESS PAGE (giving you that additional page that you are going to then MERGE)</li><li> Now go to Facebooks MERGE page HERE to begin this process.  Keep in mind Facebook will only allow two BUSINESS PAGES to MERGE if they have similar names and are essentially the same type of business.  You will select the page you want to KEEP from the first dropdown menu and then you will select the page you want to MERGE it with from the second menu. If Facebook allows your pages to be put together, you will see the CONFIRM button.</li><li> You will not be able to UNMERGE these two pages, so be sure to think through your plan before you do this.</li><h3> Deleting or Inactivating Unused Twitter Accounts</h3>The hardest part about having multiple Twitter accounts, is finding the login credentials for each one. This can be like untangling a ball of tiny chains found in the back of a jewelry box. Sometimes they slip right out and sometimes it is a long and tedious task.Currently, Twitter has no way to MERGE duplicate or similar accounts into one. They cannot move followers or the people you are following from one account to another, so sadly, it is a matter of closing down unused accounts on Twitter and/or rebranding them.You can easily change the username for your Twitter account and rebrand the images. As long as the name that you want is available, you can simply go into your settings and change the name.If you cannot even log into your old accounts because you can&rsquo;t remember the passwords, try clicking on the RESET PASSWORD and then try and remember the email that you used to set up the account. Twitter gives you a clue as to which email was used &ndash;&gt; G***@S****************.com<h3> Merging YouTube Channels and Downloading Your Videos</h3><li> This is another area that is a bigger task than you would think. At this time, YouTube cannot merge two accounts, moving videos from one account to another. You can re-upload your videos from one account to another if you still have the original video files, or you can download your videos from one account and then reupload them.</li><li> To download your own videos from YouTube (it is illegal to download someone else&rsquo;s content without their permission), go to your channel and click on VIDEO MANAGER and select VIDEOS.</li><li> Find the Video you want to download and select the DROPDOWN ARROW next to the EDIT link.</li><li> Select Download MP4.</li><a href=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/How-to-download-your-YouTube-videos-as-MP4-700x410.jpg?b4fa92\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"How to download your videos from YouTube\" height=\"410\" src=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/How-to-download-your-YouTube-videos-as-MP4-700x410.jpg?b4fa92\" width=\"700\"/></a>I hope this helps you save some of your hair from being pulled out!

Respect their time (and their  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\" target=\"_blank\">   ever-dwindling attention spans  </a> </u> ) by publishing short, &ldquo;snackable&rdquo; content. Think short phrases, action verbs and simple sentences where possible.</p><h3> Tip #2: Use Reader-Friendly Formatting <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s a reason lists generate so much traffic and so many shares online. Lists satisfy the readers&rsquo; need for structure.  <strong>  Because people don&rsquo;t read every word on your web pages, structure is important. </strong>  Use  <strong>  short paragraphs </strong>  and  <strong>  subheadings </strong>  to help users skim content. When possible, use  <strong>  bulleted lists </strong>  to help readers quickly identify the most important pieces of information.</p><h3> Tip #3: Use the Inverted Pyramid</h3><p> <br/> Journalists structure their news stories using the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://grammar.about.com/od/il/g/Inverted-Pyramid.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   inverted pyramid  </a> </u> .&rdquo; The premise is simple: People tend to read the first few paragraphs before deciding whether an article is worth their full attention.</p><p> <strong>  The inverted pyramid technique places the most important elements of a story at the beginning  </strong> and works down to the supporting details. Structuring your website content in the same way lets readers find useful information earlier in the page.</p><h3> Tip #4: Be User-Centric <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Write to help your readers, not promote your company. </strong>  While this may sound counterintuitive, this is the new reality of what your customers expect.</p><p> Before putting fingers to keyboard, think about what your prospective customers want rather than what you want to sell them.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-chasing-away-new-business-opportunities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   People hate overly self-promotional content  </a> </u> , but unfortunately that is what they usually get when they visit B2B websites. Stand out from competitors by writing content that provides a service itself rather than droning on about the services you offer.</p><h3> Tip #5: Think Beyond the Desktop <br/>  </h3><p> Earlier this year, Google announced that it now receives  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/mobile-searches-surpass-desktop-searches-at-google-for-the-first-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more searches from mobile devices  </a> </u>  than from desktop computers. By running a desktop-only website design, you run the risk of turning off users from mobile and tablet devices, or at least making it unnecessarily difficult to use your website. Incorporating a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/should-you-consider-a-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   responsive design  </a> </u>  will make your content friendlier across all platforms.</p><p> Developing quality website content that your prospective clients will find valuable takes serious commitment by you and your company, but is well worth the effort since it can position your company before competitors and generate qualified leads.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-14 20:09:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-14 20:09:50.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-website-content-tips-to-make-your-content-truly-pop/\", \"post_id\": \"8026\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-14 20:09:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-14 20:09:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-website-content-tips-to-make-your-content-truly-pop\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8025\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3754\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Website-Content-Tips-to-Make-Your-Content-Truly-Pop.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"414\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450209600,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3627,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Tips For Coping During The Holidays","link":"7-tips-for-coping-during-the-holidays","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarjiJSherman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Marji Sherman  </u> </a>  </p><p> The last time I saw my sister was on Christmas Eve. We were fighting, and I was in tears, as my dad tried to snap a family shot of his three girls. My sisters are twins, extroverts and eight years older than me &ndash;&gt; a natural clash for an introverted younger sister. Holidays always seemed to have a high-level of drama involved when our very different personalities were in the same room. That particular Christmas I was upset because I had just graduated from college and was so excited to talk about it around the dinner table. Instead, I was cut-off and moved to the back burner when my sisters started sparring about politics and other more sexy topics. I felt alone, and angry my momentous occasion was, as always, being overshadowed by the power of my twin sisters.</p><p> The next morning I was supposed to meet my sister and her husband for breakfast. I refused, not wanting to face the person that had been part of wrecking my Christmas Eve as a new college grad. Little did I know that six months later, on a random night in July, my sister would take her own life.</p><p> Fast forward a few years, and I found myself in an abusive marriage. As many of the big events in life don&rsquo;t, the timing of my need to leave the situation had little regard for the fact that it was just a few days before Christmas. Even though it was a blessing to leave, the shock and horror of the previous months made it a very tumultuous holiday season. I signed papers on Christmas Eve, I filled out all of my divorce papers near New Year&rsquo;s and mailed them close to my birthday. Basically, my holidays were wiped out.</p><p> Point? The holidays come and go every year with no regard to the events happening in our lives. They don&rsquo;t see that we are in a horrific situation and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wait until things calm down and she&rsquo;s happy again before I light the Christmas tree this year.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t realize we just lost a loved one and press pause on the holiday carols. They don&rsquo;t understand that &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; reminds us of a love past, rather than a happy future. The fact of the matter is, they are immune to what we are going through, and barrel through our lives with their cliches and memories whether we are ready for them or not.</p><p> So, does that mean we need to grin and bare it and fake smile for every photo taken of us at every holiday party? No. Does it mean we have to keep mum about tragic events that haunt us particularly during the holidays? No. However, it also doesn&rsquo;t mean that we get to play the Grinch every holiday season and close ourselves off to the miracles that so effortlessly present themselves during this magical time of year. There is a balance, and here&rsquo;s how you get there:</p><h3> Own Your Story</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t hide the fact that the holidays present some challenges for you. Own what happened to you, and be proud that you made it through to see another holiday season. The year after my holiday divorce, the number one thing that got me through the holidays was realizing how happy I was that I was not filling out divorce papers that holiday season. I could go where I wanted, see who I wanted, and embrace the new love in my life.</p><h3> Feel Your Emotions</h3><p> The holidays present a roller coaster of emotions, and you need to FEEL each and every one of those emotions. The more you try to hide the fact that you&rsquo;re sad because a certain song came on, the more sad you will feel throughout the day. Let yourself be sad, mad, happy. Live your emotions, and let them pass.</p><h3> Switch It Up</h3><p> If nostalgia is something keeping you up at night during the holidays, switch the channel! Find new ways to ring in the holidays, visit spots you&rsquo;ve never been to before, write cards to people you usually don&rsquo;t write Christmas cards for. Get yourself out of your rut and find new, unscratched ways to celebrate.</p><h3> Give, Give, Give</h3><p> The best way to distract yourself from gloom is to help others. Find ways that you can dedicate your free time to assisting those in your community during the holiday season. The more time you have wrapped up in giving back, the less time you will have to feel sorry for yourself.</p><h3> Pray</h3><p> Prayer is such a incredible tool for me during the holidays. The closer I get to God, the further away I get from remembering the lost opportunity to see my sister for the last time, or letting scars from a holiday divorce impact how I view Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s and my birthday. Allow God inside of you, allow him to walk with you through the holiday season as you celebrate the best gift He ever gave to you.</p><h3> Accept</h3><p> This is critical in order to appreciate the holidays. You absolutely have to accept whatever happened to originally make the holidays a little less bright for you. My greatest struggle with acceptance was not going to that breakfast to see my sister. When someone passes away, there is this immediate flashback to the last time you saw them. The fact that I was in tears and mad at her haunted me for quite some time. However, over the years, it&rsquo;s something I have come to accept. I was living in the moment that Christmas Eve, and I was mad at her, and if I had to do it all over again, I would still be mad at her on that Christmas Eve in that moment. All I had to go on was what was happening then, and that&rsquo;s what I made my decisions off of.</p><h3> Live For Others</h3><p> This one is helpful if you are dealing with the loss of a loved one. The only way I could cope with my best friend&rsquo;s suicide when I was 15 was to believe that I was living each moment for him, because he could never live that moment. He would never be able to go to our prom, or go to college or choose a career. Now, when I get overwhelmed with making big decisions, I think of him, and the fact that at least I still have the choice to make those decisions.</p><p> I think of this concept now during the holidays for my sister. She does not get to spend Christmas with my family in the same way anymore, but I do. Each moment is a little sweeter, a little more important a little more savored, because I now realize the value of it.</p><p> It&rsquo;s okay to not have the instant holiday cheer that is flashed on every commercial during the holidays. In reality, we are all dealing with our own share of tragedy that is only magnified during the holiday season. Try to embrace what&rsquo;s happened to you in your past, or even what you are going through now. Own it, and then move through it with grace and optimism that there is a reason you are on this journey that is bigger than yourself.</p><p> Happy Holidays to all of you who I am so grateful for!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-14 20:16:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-14 20:16:50.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-tips-for-coping-during-the-holidays/\", \"post_id\": \"8028\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-14 20:16:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-14 20:16:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-tips-for-coping-during-the-holidays\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8027\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3755\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coping-During-the-Holidays.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"617\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450202400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3628,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Secret Ways to Boost Productivity","link":"7-secret-ways-to-boost-productivity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you&rsquo;re anything like I am, you have a number of high-priority projects on your desk or in your life.</p><p> I&rsquo;m managing initiatives related to my company, current books, future books, blog, new products, and a handful of other key items. Amidst of all these, I&rsquo;m getting married next month (yay!).</p><p> With many important initiatives in motion, you know how easy it is to get off track. Toss in daily family life and it&rsquo;s a miracle anything gets done.</p><p> Colleagues and friends often wonder how I take on so much and get it done so quickly. My secret?</p><h3> 1. Three is the magic number <br/>  </h3><p> You can handle a number of high-priority projects simultaneously, but on any given day make sure you <strong>   target three key goals </strong>  or accomplishments. I have a mile-long to-do list every single day, but I have three main objectives that must be completed on that particular day. Focus on the biggies. Anything else you check off that day is gravy. Incremental daily change and advancement will result in an exponential improvement over time.</p><h3> 2. Eat the frog first <br/>  </h3><p> Every day you&rsquo;ll have some item you don&rsquo;t want to do, but needs to be done. Do it first. If it&rsquo;s done first, you won&rsquo;t waste any brainpower the rest of the day as you procrastinate this to-do you dread.</p><h3> 3. Focus on the 20% <br/>  </h3><p> I assure you, everything in your life is not created equal. My Italian brethren  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\" target=\"_blank\">   Vilfredo Pareto  </a> </u>  had no idea what he stumbled upon when he noticed that 20% of the peapods in his garden contained 80% of the peas. In other words, there is a difference between quality and productivity. Eighty percent of the effects usually come from 20% of the causes. So, if you spend your entire day working on things outside that 20%, you will achieve fewer results for the same amount of work!</p><h3> 4. Less is more and better <br/>  </h3><p> I hope everyone accomplishes more in their lives. You&rsquo;ll have a better chance if you  <strong>  focus on fewer tasks </strong>  and ensure higher quality output. It amazes me that at any moment people think they can do more, but over their lifetime think they&rsquo;ll accomplish less. They typically accomplish less because they&rsquo;re trying to handle more at any moment. Which leads me to&hellip;</p><h3> 5. Don&rsquo;t multitask <br/>  </h3><p> Beside the fact there is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95256794\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   no such thing as multitasking  </a> </u>  (it&rsquo;s called switching tasks quickly), people attempt to juggle and break things in the process. Do one thing at a time and give it your full attention. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at what you can produce.</p><h3> 6. Take in only what you need <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t read the entire article if the headline will suffice. Sometimes, you need the entire article. When production is at stake, make sure to choose wisely. Once the time is expended, it&rsquo;s gone forever. Speaking of&hellip;</p><h3> 7. Stay on time <br/>  </h3><p> Set an optimal schedule and stick to it.  <strong>  An optimal schedule has recovery gaps in it. </strong> That means if you have any unforeseen overruns, you have designated, planned recovery periods. You probably have heard the expression being on time is being respectful of the people you&rsquo;re meeting. Their time is equally as valuable as yours. Well, all day long you meet with yourself. Be respectful, especially to that person.</p><p> <strong>  What are   your   secret ways to boost productivity? </strong></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-14 20:23:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-14 20:23:03.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-secret-ways-to-boost-productivity/\", \"post_id\": \"8030\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-14 20:23:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-14 20:23:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-secret-ways-to-boost-productivity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8029\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3756\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Secret-Ways-to-Boost-Productivity.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"419\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450186200,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3629,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Faster Horses... and Customer Outcomes","link":"faster-horses-and-customer-outcomes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Are you asking your customers the right questions? </strong> <br/> <br/> We all know the Henry Ford quote that goes like this: <br/> <br/> If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.  <br/> <br/> (It's fair to note that some don't believe he actually said this, but let's go with it.) It's cited often when naysayers try to tell us that customers don't know what they want, i.e., customers can't help us innovate because they just want \"faster horses.\" Instead, they feel that some visionary can create a better product; the problem is, these visionaries don't come along every day. <br/> <br/> So back to the faster horses problem. To that I say, \"That's what happens when you ask the wrong question!\" This is an issue that I've been calling the \"Henry Ford Principle\" in recent conversations. <br/> <br/> In truth, most customers don't know what they want. And that's OK. They don't know what they want because they're focused on what they are trying to do, not on designing products - that's your job; if you can solve that problem for them - design a product to help them do what they're trying to do - then you'll sell some products and have some very happy customers.  </p><p> Steve Jobs said:  You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new.</p><p> This is true. So, don't ask them what they want. Ask them what they're trying to do, what they're trying to achieve. Ask them about their pain points, their needs, their desired outcomes in what they're doing.  <br/> <br/> If you ask them what they want, they'll kill you with features and enhancements that will have that faster horse looking like an alien with three eyes, four ears, five legs and seven tails that trots sideways. None of the enhancement requests will be cohesive or make sense to the big picture. You'll just keep adding on more features and functionality, until, in the end, you have a product that's far too complex to use and doesn't suit anyone's needs. (I've seen this happen! It's not pretty.) <br/> <br/> Instead, step back and ask customers about their pain points with the current product, what it's not doing for them, what they're trying to achieve that they can't. Or bypass thinking about the current product; focus on a situation for which you'll develop a new or better solution. Focus on what customers are trying to do and uncover unmet needs to aid in your new product design efforts. <br/> <br/> I think a good approach is this:</p><li> <strong>  Identify the need and level set: </strong> ask about the pain points, needs, outcomes; identify the problem to solve; get at the root cause for a truly successful product</li><li> <strong>  Develop some success metrics: </strong> how will you know that you've met your customers' needs? solved their problems?</li><li> <strong>  Ideate: </strong> brainstorm and develop a couple of solid ideas based on what you heard (here's where the visionary in you and your team might come out!)</li><li> <strong>  Co-create: </strong> take some ideas, develop, and iterate - with customers</li><li> <strong>  Develop: </strong> based on co-creation and iteration, select the final product design and build it</li><li> <strong>  Test your product: </strong> this will be a larger test than to those who helped co-create</li><li> <strong>  Measure performance/success: </strong> how well does this product help customers achieve their desired outcomes? what's the experience?</li><li> <strong>  Continuous listening: </strong> over time, the needs and outcomes evolve and so should the product <br/>  </li><p> Does that sound too complex? It shouldn't. The customer needs to be at the center of your product design process.

Luxury home construction boomed. Lucky speculators erected statues of themselves. The jewelry market surged.</p><p> Of course, it didn&rsquo;t last. Within a few years, the market crashed, and the Mississippi Company went down in history as one of the greatest bubbles of all times.</p><h3> Looking back it should have been obvious.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, all great financial bubbles often have watershed moments that in many ways signify the height of lunacy.</p><p> Joseph Kennedy, for example, famously sold all of his stocks right before the great crash in 1929 after a shoeshine boy started giving him investment advice.</p><p> Pets.com, a symbol of the 1990s tech bubble, IPO&rsquo;d just two years after it was founded with a $300 million market capitalization.</p><p> They were so flush with capital that they spent $2 million on a tacky Superbowl ad, only to go bust 268 days later.</p><h3> Duh. It&rsquo;s so obvious looking back.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve long believed our entire financial system is in a similar position.</p><p> Western banking systems are dangerously illiquid and in many cases undercapitalized.</p><p> Meanwhile the central banks and governments meant to support them are nearly insolvent and bankrupt themselves.</p><p> There are a lot of flashing warning signs right now that the system is quickly running out of steam.</p><p> China&rsquo;s vast, multi-trillion dollar stockpile of foreign reserves is dropping rapidly, down by $87 billion in November, the third highest decline on record.</p><p> A whopping $1.2 trillion worth of corporate bonds in the United States has just been downgraded by rating agencies.</p><p> Median home prices in over a third of major American cities have once again surpassed all-time highs from the last bubble.</p><p> US government debt is at an all-time high after rising an astounding $674 billion just in the month of November.</p><p> It&rsquo;s pretty clear there&rsquo;s an incredible amount of risk in the system.</p><p> And in the future when we look back and say, &ldquo;It should have been so obvious,&rdquo; here are a few events that may become famous watershed moments:</p><h3> 1) The $75 billion loan</h3><p> <br/> AB InBev just secured an astonishing $75 BILLION loan to buy rival SABMiller.</p><p> This is the biggest commercial loan in the history of the world, roughly equivalent to the GDP of Azerbaijan.</p><p> It&rsquo;s incredible that anyone is able to borrow an amount like this, let alone at the low rate of just 1.1% above LIBOR.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a stretch to think that we may look back at this and say, &lsquo;that was the top&hellip; what an obvious example of how much money central bankers have printed.&rsquo;</p><h3> 2) The junk bond collapse</h3><p> <br/> Back in 2013, the yield on &lsquo;high yield corporate bonds&rsquo; aka junk bonds dipped below 5% for the first time in history.</p><p> It shouldn&rsquo;t have taken a rocket scientist to figure out how absurd that was, but now that the trend is reversing and the junk bond market is stalling investors are losing their shirts.</p><p> One hedge fund that had invested heavily in junk bonds just suspended redemptions for its investors, something only really done in times of crisis.</p><p> This could be the historical watershed moment that signals the beginning of the end of our massive financial bubble.</p><h3> 3) The POPPY Loan [my favorite]</h3><p> <br/> San Francisco Federal Credit Union wants to help its customers buy unaffordable homes in the astonishingly overpriced region of northern California.</p><p> So they just rolled out a new loan program called the Proud Ownership Purchase Program for You, or POPPY for short.</p><p> POPPY loans allow customers to borrow up to $2 MILLION with absolutely no money down.</p><p> And no, I am not making this up.</p><h3> $0 down. $2 million. At 4% interest.</h3><p> <br/> Oh, and you don&rsquo;t have to take out private mortgage insurance (PMI) either.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re not familiar, PMI is something that banks typically require when borrowers don&rsquo;t contribute a sufficient down payment; it insures the bank against loss in case the borrower defaults.</p><p> So here the bank is taking 100% of the financial risk lending against property in an overpriced market that&rsquo;s near its all-time high.</p><h3> And they&rsquo;re doing it with your money.</h3><p> <br/> This is a story so familiar it&rsquo;s as if they ripped it from the playbook of the 2006 housing bubble.</p><p> We know what happened. We know how that bubble ended.</p><p> Central banks have printed so many trillions of dollars that there&rsquo;s hardly anything that makes sense in the financial system anymore.</p><p> This is not a consequence-free environment&hellip; it&rsquo;s time to find safety.</p><p> Gold and silver are traditionally great hedges against systemic risk.</p><p> Physical cash, as we&rsquo;ll discuss next week, may also be a good option. Especially given that there&rsquo;s minimal downside in doing so.</p><p> Private equity investments in productive, undervalued companies are also traditionally safe bets in both good times and bad.</p><p> Most of all, don&rsquo;t ignore the risks or assume everything&rsquo;s going to be OK because our politicians and central bankers are so smart that they can solve anything.</p><h3> They&rsquo;re not.</h3><p> <br/> And they&rsquo;ve obviously missed the message that 2006 called: he wants his bubble back.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 18:57:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 18:57:13.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-signs-weve-reached-the-top-in-the-financial-system/\", \"post_id\": \"8036\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 18:57:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 18:57:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-signs-weve-reached-the-top-in-the-financial-system\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8035\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3759\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3-Signs-Weve-Reached-the-Top-in-the-Financial-System.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"744\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450259100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Years ago as I was struggling to make sales, I found a bad pattern had developed in terms of how my sales attempts were ending up.  After pitching and pitching, most of my sales were being stalled with some variation of:</p><p> &ldquo;Let me think about it,&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to discuss this with my partner&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;O.K., why don&rsquo;t you get back with me in a few weeks&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Sound familiar?  It should.  Most sales presentations end this way.  After racking my brain for the reason, I finally began listening to how the top closers in my company were closing their sales.  And how they were opening and qualifying their prospects as well. </p><p> Turns out they all were using one magic word.  And the word was&hellip;.</p><h3> &ldquo;Today.&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> Or some variation of it when they were qualifying.  And that&rsquo;s when I started using it as well and it didn&rsquo;t just boost my sales, it catapulted it!  In fact, it had much more impact than that.  It also greatly reduced the number of unqualified leads I sent out and spent hours of useless time with. </p><h3> Here are some examples of how to use the word today in both your opening and closing statements.</h3><p> <br/> For qualifying you must qualify the prospect&rsquo;s timeline and set the proper expectation for the close.  At the end of your cold call and before you schedule your demo or send your information, you must ask something like this:</p><p> &ldquo;So _________, I&rsquo;ve got you on the calendar to do a walk-through of our solution next Wednesday, and if after we&rsquo;re done you really like this, is it something that you can make a decision on at that time?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;So _________, I look forward to our demo next Wednesday, and if after we&rsquo;re done you really like this, I&rsquo;m going to ask you for a simple yes or no, is that fair?&rdquo;</p><p> Now in some situations if you&rsquo;re dealing with an influencer, your question will be about what the next steps are, what the decision maker&rsquo;s time frame is like, how many other companies they&rsquo;re looking at, etc.. </p><p> But if you are dealing with the owner or decision maker, you must get a firm commitment as to timeframe, ideally confirming a decision right after your pitch.</p><h3> For closing calls, you use the magic word:</h3><p> <br/> At the beginning of your presentation, before you go into your slide show or however you do it, you requalify by asking:</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to show you this, and at the end if you feel this is the right solution for you, this is something you can move on today, right?&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s it.  No wishy washy way around it.  You must set a clear expectation right from the beginning (and that means on the qualifying call) and then reconfirm it at the beginning of the close. </p><p> I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: &ldquo;What if they say no?&rdquo;  Then you adjust your presentation to target their buying motive and start overcoming what their objection is.  I&rsquo;ve written many of <a href=\"http://mrinsidesales.com/insidesalestrainingblog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   scripts  </u> </a> to help you do that, so check out my blog if you need them.</p><p> Bottom line: You will make more sales faster and with less struggle if you set the proper expectation on the front call and confirm it by opening your closing call using the magic word: today.</p><p> <strong>  Try it today and see for yourself. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 19:34:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 19:34:56.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/boost-your-sales-by-using-this-one-word/\", \"post_id\": \"8038\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 19:34:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 19:34:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"boost-your-sales-by-using-this-one-word\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8037\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3760\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/One-word-to-boost-sales.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"347\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/are-paperless-passports-in-your-future/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450262700,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

A new study shows they eventually do spend much of this money and sheds light on where it goes.</h3>The study focuses on the retirement spending patterns of couples, adding to similar past studies on single retirees. While both spouses are alive, the researchers found that a couple&rsquo;s wealth remains relatively stable over time &ndash; until they start paying for medical care, nursing homes, and other major end-of-life expenses.The researchers examined spending patterns for more than 4,600 households over a 15-year period using a subset of the Health and Retirement Study that collects data on the health and wealth of people over age 70. Wealth included savings and retirement accounts, investments, and home equity.Couples in two different income groups were compared: the average couple at the 20th percentile has about $14,000 in post-retirement income and $70,000 in wealth at age 74; the 80th percentile couple has more than $30,000 in income and $330,000 in wealth.Here are the study&rsquo;s main <u> <a href=\"https://mrdrc.isr.umich.edu/publications/papers/pdf/wp322.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  findings </a></u>:<li> For couples in both income groups, wealth remains much the  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/retiree-paralysis-can-i-spend-my-money/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   same  </a> </u>  so long as both spouses are alive.</li><li> For the higher-income couples, wealth declines by about $60,000 during the year of the first spouse&rsquo;s death, with the largest outlays going toward medical and nursing home care.</li><li> The wealth of lower-income couples also drops sharply if the husband is the first to die &ndash; but, interestingly, wealth changes very little if the wife passes away first.</li><li> After the second spouse dies, lower-income couples&rsquo; savings have been largely depleted.

And the database is more than just a list of cases. It includes search functionality, so people can look for all the case law on a particular subject (the example given being  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ravellaw.com/search/m?query=%22campaign%20finance%22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   campaign finance  </a> </u> ). Moreover, a visualization tool shows all the cases on a timeline and through the various degrees of court, and also shows the linkages between all the various cases. In other words, if one case is cited by another case, there&rsquo;s a line connecting them, and the visualization changes in real time as you scroll over them.</p><p> The law has traditionally lagged behind technology. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/supreme-court-finally-put-all-records-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Supreme Court  </a> </u> , for example, just announced in January of this year that it intended to put its files online, a project that is expected to be completed next year. Similarly, the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pacer.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER)  </a> </u>  court database still looks much like it did when it was  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/bringing-pacer-court-system-century/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first designed in the early 2000s  </a> </u> .

While the online Supreme Court system is intended to be free for users, PACER has been criticized for its cost as much as for its outmoded technology.</p><p> &ldquo;Though the primary documents are formally in the public domain, many are not put online in a convenient format, if at all,&rdquo; writes Eckholm. &ldquo;Many states even rely on commercial services to post court briefs and decisions, which then provide them to paying subscribers. Legal groups spend anywhere from thousands of dollars a year, for a small office, to millions, for a giant firm, using commercial services.&rdquo;</p><p> Complete state results will become publicly available this fall for California and New York, and the entire library will be online in 2017, Eckholm writes. The entire underlying database will be shared with nonprofit organizations and scholars that wish to develop specialized applications, and the database will be withheld from other commercial groups for eight years, he adds.</p><p> In particular, the project is intended to help  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2015/1029/How-Harvard-s-Free-the-Law-project-could-change-legal-practices\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   support various legal aid societies  </a> </u>  that ensure the indigent get their day in court, writes Olivia Lowenberg in the Christian Science Monitor. &ldquo;Harvard Law School  <u>  <a href=\"http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/clinical/clinics/harvard-legal-aid-bureau/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   already offers free legal aid for indigent persons  </a> </u> , through its student-run Legal Aid Bureau,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;When &lsquo;Free the Law&rsquo; is completed, it will not only allow those second- and third-year students who run the program to search for cases similar to their own with greater ease, but also improve the argument-making ability of lawyers at other legal aid groups throughout the country.&rdquo; And a number of those organizations said the Harvard project was &ldquo;a welcome development that may save them money and make the law more accessible to struggling lawyers, students and even inmates who try to mount appeals from spotty prison libraries,&rdquo; Eckholm writes.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also said that the  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Justice\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wheels of justice turn slowly  </a> </u> .

{"original_id":3636,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Traits Of A Serial Victim","link":"7-traits-of-a-serial-victim","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Most self-help, personal growth, and motivational advice is consistent with the declaration that a victim mentality is bad for us: physically bad, emotionally bad, and spiritually bad.</h3><p> <br/> The televangelist, Pastor Joel Osteen urges, &ldquo;Have a victor mentality, not a victim mentality. Yet, despite what we all know on the inside, being a victim sometimes just feels so comfortable, so usual, so familiar. It is what we have come to expect, so much so that often we don&rsquo;t even realize we may have become a serial victim.</p><p> Well, I have to jump on the bandwagon of others and give you this assurance: if you insist on maintaining a victim mentality, you will forever be a victim of it and true health, happiness, and success is likely to be elusive.</p><p> Before you write nasty comments and call me insensitive (see #5 below), I am not blaming the victim here. What I am urging victims to do, no matter how horrific the circumstance, is to see how events continue to replay to shape your personality, behavior, faith, belief&mdash;your life.</p><h3> So how can you tell if you or someone you know is a serial victim? These seven observations may help. </h3><h3> <br/> 1. Never accept blame</h3><p> Many victims will never take personal responsibility. Their predicament is always someone else&rsquo;s fault. Often, this is because once they take responsibility, they are thrust into the unfamiliar territory of not being a victim, on their way to being a victor&mdash;and this can be very scary.</p><h3> 2. Always accept blame</h3><p> Huh?! But I thought you just said&hellip;Someone who was the victim of abuse or a violent crime has difficulty allowing themselves to be happy, to be victorious. That is because on some level they continue to blame themselves for the misfortune that may have beset them, often circumstances well beyond their control.  For them, being a victor is too scary, because to their brain, they are undeserving.</p><h3> 3. Can&rsquo;t let go of the past</h3><p> For the victim, the past is their homestead. They will continue to tap into the past for evidence to support why they must stay a victim. Most of the time the knowledge they take from the past is not to learn and grow, but to reinforce and explain their hardship and disadvantage.</p><h3> 4. Benefit from it</h3><p> Playing the victim role can confer certain benefits. In medicine, there is a term called &ldquo;secondary gain&rdquo; that explains the benefit, or gain, of remaining sick. If that&rsquo;s the only way you get attention, well then there is motivation to remain down. I recall being quite sick with pneumonia when I was merely seven years old. My father would bring me home a small gift every night for about two weeks. When I got better, I felt a little sad. Why? No more gifts! Thank God I got over that!!</p><h3> 5. Use it for power</h3><p> Ironically, being a victim can place one in a position of power. Many quote scripture, to flex their victim muscle, &ldquo;Blessed be the poor.&rdquo; I challenge anyone to come up with something more powerful than the blessing of God. Additionally, through social media and other outlets, a person can use their victim status to malign someone or a group in order to get something they feel due them, simply by making the person or group look unkind or insensitive to their needs. This victim &ldquo;power play&rdquo; is perhaps the most insidious way for one to use their victim status and perhaps the most self-destructive.</p><h3> 6. Enjoy throwing their own pity party</h3><p> The only type of party a victim seems to enjoy is a pity party. And to plan one, all it takes is a good dose of passive-aggressive behavior. &ldquo;You go on, have a good time, don&rsquo;t worry about me, I&rsquo;ll be here when you get back. Some people are just luckier than me.&rdquo; This &ldquo;woe is me&rdquo; mentality simply reinforces being a victim and makes this party sad and pathetic.</p><h3> 7. Provides a convenient excuse</h3><p> Whatever makes you a victim can keep you neatly tucked in your comfort zone; albeit a zone that is ultimately uncomfortable. You can use being a victim as an excuse not to challenge yourself or seek personal growth. Additionally, confrontation is hard for most people, but especially if you have a victim mentality. Many victims remain passive, allowing the weakness of their &ldquo;disability&rdquo; to prevent them from being assertive and voicing their opinion.</p><p> Whether you consider yourself to be a victim or someone else, becoming aware of these behaviors is the first step. And though, there are many shades of grey when it comes to being a victim, one thing is constant for all: making it your life mission to change from a victim mentality to a victor mentality will expose a greatness within you, a personal power, a pure potential. Shifting these mental and behavioral fortresses will connect you to a life where being a victor is the norm, as you develop a oneness with your Divine nature.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 20:44:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 20:44:13.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-traits-of-a-serial-victim/\", \"post_id\": \"8046\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 20:44:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 20:44:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-traits-of-a-serial-victim\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8045\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3764\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Traits-Of-A-Serial-Victim.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"709\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450292400,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

The insights that are generated by these technologies will give businesses the opportunity to rethink their operational model and the needed human skills. Will it affect the workforce? Will it change the labour market? Yes, we need to accept that and look at the benefits of finally being able to empower the human-to-human approach.</p><p> Humans are afraid of change, always have been. Change means stepping outside the comfort zone. Why do we feel threatened by that, instead of feeling challenged by the opportunities it provides us?</p><p> We are heading towards a society that will be assisted by smart machines and automated solutions. Will that threaten your job? When you have a job that requires for example repetitive motion and basic data analysis, it probably will be done by robots in a few years. The Randstad/SEO report, &ldquo;Into the Gap&rdquo; (2012) indeed illustrates that developments in labour market will head that way. People for the so called middle class workers need to scale up as a knowledge worker or settle for lower skilled jobs. Either way, this will mean a huge shift in the labour market. Where that will leave the affected groups of people? They need to think about what they are good at, what skills can make them an expert and how that can change their role in the business they are in. On the other hand our educational system needs to change drastically, as  <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/technology-2/lifelong-learning-has-become-key-to-society-and-individual-careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I earlier stated </a> . It will take some effort, but it will be worthwhile for all parties involved.</p><p> Robotics enables organisations to optimise their customer centricity. Big data and analytics derive a degree of predictability that helps creating customer value and really putting your customers first. In the end this will generate the most and longest lasting business value. The opportunity to focus on what really matters in relation to your customer will become more and more leading, requiring a vigorous need for human skills. In this perspective, robotics will stimulate the increase of new jobs. So we should embrace robotics and look at how we can change the way we integrate robots and humans into a powerful workforce.</p><p> Let me explain how.</p><h3> What makes people indispensable</h3><p> <br/> Technology will enable businesses to focus on what is really important to reinforce their core business. The added value of the human workforce will change from handling concrete actions into fulfilling the role of a coach, consultant or advisor. People will be giving a clear steer as to the businesses context and/or output. Robots can never replicate people when it comes to personal relationships and intuition. We need to see robotics as resources that spare time, increase capacity and boost productivity. Because ultimately it will allow businesses to focus on the human side of what they do. No matter the industry, those at the end of the sales funnel are human beings. Thus, people will not be threatened, their unique skills will become even more valuable.

Today&rsquo;s businesses are fully set up to be able to meet their customers&rsquo; demands. Of course, automation can optimise processes and technology can be very helpful in areas of self-services, which can be practical in some cases. Nonetheless, when it comes to connecting with your customers, building relationships and engaging them to your business or brand for the longer term, you need human interaction. Your customers want to relate to someone; whatever happens, they cannot relate to robots. Humans go the extra mile for a client or a colleague. That extra mile is what will turn customers into loyal customers.</p><h3> Innovation needs human (soft) skills</h3><p> <br/> Technology is important for the future business, but innovation transcends technology. It is about what can make this world a better place to live in and to work in. To be truly innovative requires a high level of collaboration, idea sharing and creativity. It is simply impossible to programme that or plug it in. Artificial intelligence or automation might be the tooling you need to make an innovation work, but it won&rsquo;t design the innovation for you. It is the human to human approach that motivates and stimulates to think beyond the borders of today&rsquo;s operational models and (business) ecosystems.</p><h3> Teaching tomorrow&rsquo;s skills today</h3><p> <br/> How do we get people to focus on the advantages of the changes caused by the new industrial revolution? Well, the problem is not that the knowledge we are transferring, is not relevant anymore. We somehow forgot to adapt that knowledge to the evolution our society is going through. This concerns not only the technological changes, also the changes in social interaction that derive from personal ecosystems and the sharing economy. We are failing to set up an educational system according the skills we need today, or even better, tomorrow! This will prepare (future) job seekers for dealing with the constantly changing labour market and the accelerating effects of technology. Also, it will make them more flexible towards allowing robots to integrate with the workforce.</p><p> We have a bright future awaiting&hellip;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 20:50:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 20:50:15.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-robotics-takes-over-humans-can-finally-focus/\", \"post_id\": \"8048\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 20:50:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 20:50:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-robotics-takes-over-humans-can-finally-focus\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8047\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3765\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/When-Robotics-Takes-Over-Humans-Can-Finally-Focus.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"887\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450285200,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}

Based on what you think you have said and what the person you said it to hears is often different.  </h3><p> <br/> Speaking the same language doesn&rsquo;t ensure the same meaning.  The difference may be subtle, but the follow up behaviors or actions or emotions that were ignited could be anywhere from incorrect to disastrous.   Many misunderstandings in business and personal relationships result in damage to those relationships or wrong actions taken affecting business.  They could be avoided if we all committed to becoming better listeners by embracing the notion that our way is not always the best or only way.  </p><h3> Here are some tips on how to become a better listener: <br/>  </h3><li> Get rid of the idea that you have to be right. If you have an investment in  being right, you have already closed down your ability to hear. Besides if you are always right that means the other person is always wrong. Does that really compute?</li><li> Listen with an open mind. There are a lot of other ideas and perspectives out there. Many of them are good and some may be better than yours.</li><li> Repeat back what you have heard to make sure you have clearly understood what was said.</li><li> Forget about preparing your response. Respond after you listened well. There is nothing wrong with taking your time.</li><li> Express your own point of view and feelings honestly and with respect for the listener. These skills take discipline and practice. Change your mind set from win-lose to win-win. Think in terms of shared goals, mutual respect teamwork, accommodation and compromise.</li><li> Suspend the habit of judging what is being said. Just listen. Quiet your mind and focus on hearing what is being said without thinking about your next comeback.</li><li> Actively participate by giving positive feedback. State your understanding of what you are hearing, and ask questions when things are not clear.</li><li> Be open to options. Get rid of the idea that you must know everything and always be right. Remember that there is always more than one way to do things. Find ways to synthesize your perspective with those of others.</li><li> Conduct brainstorming sessions in which all ideas are received without criticism, no matter how absurd they initially sound. Get feedback from everyone on the various options before one is chosen.</li><li> Keep the goal of the meeting in mind and do not get sidetracked by ego trips, turf issues or personalities.</li><li> Handle disagreements graciously, without being critical of anyone.</li><li> Keep meeting discussions confidential. Do not gossip later about who said what to whom.</li><li> Endorse the final plan, even if it was not your idea that was adopted.</li><li> Follow through with commitments in a timely manner. <br/>  </li><p> How do you rate?

You don&rsquo;t even agree with what she&rsquo;s saying!&rdquo;   <strong>  I mean, yes I agree if she&rsquo;s talking about people sharing with us any kind of hate message or bullying, but&hellip; </strong></p><p> I don&rsquo;t 100% agree. I truly want to know more about people than just posting positive quotes from dead people. <strong>   I mean I honestly think there&rsquo;s a balance. </strong>   When we post only the positive affirmations, sayings and reflections, we don&rsquo;t give voice to the things that are less than rose posey, kittens and ribbons. We miss out on connecting through the juice of life.  The everyday, regular, life.</p><p> Our feelings, our thoughts our deepest pondering.   <strong>  This is real life we are talking about.  </strong> I don&rsquo;t know about you but when I see someone only post super awesome-sauce about their fabulous life, two things happen.</p><li> I don&rsquo;t relate at all because my life is so weird, (I am a mother for heaven&rsquo;s sake), and Polly Anna all-the-live-long-day bores the crap out of me.</li><li> I know it&rsquo;s not real, (you know it&rsquo;s not real), nobody lives like that.  Nobody. <br/>  </li><p> I agree with my interviewer that positive is good.  But real life, even the struggle is &ldquo;good&rdquo; to connect us more deeply.  By-the-way, yes, <strong>   I Tweet dead people. </strong>   Yeah, I&rsquo;m Twitter positive, Facebook positive, Instagram positive, and bloody Snapchat positive. However, where I part ways with my interviewer, is that I believe that we can sometimes do more harm than good when our posts are 100% picture perfect all the time. It&rsquo;s just not real life. It&rsquo;s not revealing.</p><p> <strong>  My favorite people online&hellip; the ones I love to follow, I engage with most, and I&rsquo;m willing to give them my email address and sign up for all their shit, are the flawed ones. </strong>  The ones who make me giggle at the folly, the pit falls, the stumbles, and fall-flat-on-your-face adventure that this human experience holds for us sometimes.</p><p> <strong>  Being human is a learning adventure, it&rsquo;s messy, it&rsquo;s complicated, it&rsquo;s sticky, and I think we learn not only through encouragement (the positive), but support, (the honest, transparent, flawed side we all share). </strong></p><p> How many parenting experts talk about how we damage our children by incessant praise and delivering unearned trophies for simply showing up to the soccer field?  We don&rsquo;t do our kids any favors by shielding them from the realities of the world.  We also don&rsquo;t do one another any favors by shielding each other from pain, suffering, and all manner of human expression.  <strong>   Since when is it &ldquo;bad&rdquo; to show people you have challenges? </strong>   I actually don&rsquo;t even see it as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;  To me it all just &ldquo;is.&rdquo;  This &ldquo;is&rdquo; the gritty, gusto, goofy, Ooey Gooey stuff of life.</p><p> <strong>  I don&rsquo;t need another picture-perfect cardboard personality to connect to, do you? </strong>   Give me your flaws, your laughter, your silly side, your camaraderie, your irreverence, your transparency, your sadness, your challenges, and your vulnerability to just &ldquo;be&rdquo; you and allow me to just &ldquo;be&rdquo; me.</p><p> That&rsquo;s the beauty of real relationship.  The gorgeous support and buoyancy of an authentic, genuine, transparent, human connection. We all embraced the Velveteen Rabbit while he was covered with stains.  What made him real, makes us real.

Industry surveys indicate that B2C businesses will spend on average 32% of their total 2016 marketing budgets on content marketing1. Its power as a lead generator is unmatched, and if you&rsquo;re not doing it&mdash;and doing it right&mdash;you&rsquo;re missing a critical piece of your marketing puzzle. Worse, you could be losing business.</p><p> Ok, ok, you&rsquo;ve heard this before, right? The benefits are well documented. Experts will tell you that content marketing:</p><li> Builds awareness</li><li> Helps customers find you</li><li> Establishes you as a thought leader <br/>  </li><p> All those are true, but there&rsquo;s one major benefit that even experts often overlook, and that is: content is key to creating an irresistible brand.</p><h3> What is a brand and how is it connected to content marketing?</h3><p> <br/> A brand isn&rsquo;t just a logo, typeface, and slogan. Your brand is the entire personality of your company. Think of it as the feelings and emotions that are evoked within a customer when they hear your name.</p><p> Brands are built slowly, piece by piece with each point of contact between you and your customers. Every ad, email, tweet, and blog post adds to your brand. Over time, good branding creates trust, establishes value, and fosters a sense familiarity.</p><p> In 2016, content marketing could be the most important tool for building your brand.</p><h3> Why is content marketing so critical to creating a brand?</h3><p> <br/> When you view your competitors&rsquo; websites, display ads, or marketing emails, do you ever feel they all look very similar? That&rsquo;s no accident.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s smart web developers and digital marketers know what makes people tick (and click!), and websites are finely tuned to be efficient and effective. The best digital practices are always emulated, borrowed, and replicated. This improves user experience, but as everyone copies the same successful strategies, variety and uniqueness decrease. This leaves many sites looking like they&rsquo;re cut from the same template, because they are.</p><p> If you want to stand out from the crowd, you need a new technique to differentiate. So what&rsquo;s the best way to differentiate online today? Yep, you guessed it: content marketing.</p><h3> Content marketing establishes your unique value proposition</h3><p> <br/> More than any other aspect of your online presence, content marketing allows you to communicate your unique value proposition; the aspect of your business that tells customers &ldquo;this is why you should choose me instead of my competitors&rdquo;.</p><p> Content marketing gives you the time, space, and freedom to engage deeply with customers&mdash;something that&rsquo;s impossible to do in a 728 x 90-pixel banner ad.</p><p> Best of all, content marketing brims with real personality because it captures your own voice. Content takes your business beyond a robotic marketing slogan. Sure, the tone of your content should be professional, but when that tone echoes your individuality, you stand out from a noisy field of competitors.</p><h3> 3 simple tips to creating content that makes your brand shine <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Produce content that reinforces your points of difference </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Before you write, ask yourself: how do my skills, my experience, my expertise, solve customers&rsquo; problems better than my competitors? The answers are your points of difference and combined they form your unique value proposition. Write them on a sticky note and place it next to your monitor.</p><p> If your content clearly demonstrates your points of difference, customers will understand exactly why they need to choose your business.</p><li> <strong>  Think of content as the evidence that supports your marketing claims </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Say your company&rsquo;s slogan is &ldquo;Manitoba&rsquo;s Master of Tax Minimization&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a bold statement, but why should customers believe you? In the past, businesses relied on word of mouth and testimonials to substantiate these claims. Today, content marketing is the tool that proves your expertise to millions of skeptical customers before they ever do business with you.</p><li> <strong>  Be consistent and find your own voice </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Decide on a style and vocabulary that reflects you and your business. A casual and accessible tone is effective for some audiences while others expect you to be formal and authoritative. Whichever style you choose, be sure that it carries your personal voice. This will build stronger connections, and ensures that your content feels fresh.</p><h3> Summing up</h3><p> <br/> Good brands are not created by telling customers why your business is great, they&rsquo;re created by demonstrating it. And in today&rsquo;s competitive digital landscape, content marketing is the most powerful tool for proving your value and building a business that gets noticed in a crowded marketplace.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 21:27:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 21:27:12.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stand-above-the-crowd-with-a-content-marketing-tactic-your-competitors-are-neglecting/\", \"post_id\": \"8054\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 21:27:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 21:27:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stand-above-the-crowd-with-a-content-marketing-tactic-your-competitors-are-neglecting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8053\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3768\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stand-Above-the-Crowd-With-a-Content-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1062\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450281600,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3641,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 of 2015's Biggest Digital Marketing Changes","link":"4-of-2015s-biggest-digital-marketing-changes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s true, 2015 isn&rsquo;t over yet and we certainly don&rsquo;t intend to rush the season, but this past year has brought with it many changes in digital marketing. Just 12 months in a year, and it&rsquo;s fascinating how much can change both with the consumer mindset as well as with the tools, programs, and campaigns that companies use to engage with their audiences. One thing is certain: if companies aren&rsquo;t keeping up with the changes and demands of consumers, they will eventually be left behind completely, attempting to reach an audience that is no longer listening.So what were some of the biggest changes to the way marketers used digital marketing in 2015? Here are 4 of the top changes we&rsquo;ve noticed:</p><h3> 1. Social Media:</h3>Social media continues to be a very important digital marketing communication method for companies in both the B2B and BsC space. What changed during 2015 wasn&rsquo;t the use of social media in general, but how it was used. Brands that promoted themselves and used Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn solely as an advertisement lost followers and engagement fell. Whereas companies that used these platforms to tell stories, connect with buyers and prospective buyers, and engage by being up-to-date with messaging and on point with content marketing, saw massive increases in followers as well as overall engagement.According to <u> <a href=\"https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/top-5-digital-marketing-trends-for-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Innovation Enterprise </a></u>, social media is now not simply a way to gather your fans in one place, it is a way to spread stories and content that they want to see.<h3> 2. Content Marketing &gt; Story-Telling:</h3>If you&rsquo;ve been involved in content marketing during 2015, you know this area of digital has seen a massive shift away from companies just producing &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo; content in order to spike website traffic and get clicks. Now, digital marketers must carefully plan out their content marketing in accordance with trends in the industry, time of year (calendaring), and personas of readers - all with the goal of telling a compelling story, versus trying to sell a product or service.<u> Seth Godin</u> is quoted saying, &ldquo;Marketing is no longer about the stuff you make, but the stories you tell&rdquo;. We couldn&rsquo;t agree more with this as consumers no longer want to be sold on your product or service. They want to be empowered to make the purchase decision themselves, but truly understanding how it will affect them personally, or the company they represent.Many content marketing leaders, such as Jay Baer with <u> <a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Convince and Convert </a></u> (@Convince), have been predicting this shift for several years now. For more great information on how to tell a story with your business, check out the podcast &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://www.parkandco.com/thebusinessofstory/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Business of Story </a></u>&rdquo;.<h3> 3. Mobile Everything</h3>This may go without saying, but we are a mobile society in every way possible. This past Cyber Monday was the largest grossing retail day EVER with almost $3B in online sales, many of those dollars sourced via a mobile device. Not only that, Nearly two-thirds of Americans are now smartphone owners, and for many these devices are a key entry point to the online world, according to a recent study by the <u> <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pew Research Center </a></u> on mobile phone usage in the U.S. No longer do Americans &ldquo;go offline&rdquo; after leaving work or stop engaging via their mobile devices at night or in the morning or even on weekends. They use their phones to engage with family members, to watch videos, to use apps for directions, ordering food, making a grocery list&hellip; you get it. The mobile device is now a basic human necessity on many levels, and presents a huge opportunity for digital marketers to meet their consumers literally anywhere, at any time, with the right message based on behavior.According to <u> Digital Doughtnut</u>, in accordance with a recent report on the behaviour of IT buyers conducted by IDG, 61% of B2B users will watch mobile videos relating to their work, while 57% will access work-related mobile content outside of business hours. These figures show us the huge number of opportunities that mobile devices offer digital marketers, both inside and outside of the working time-zone.<h3> 4. Content creators on the rise</h3>Neil Patel, a contributor at <u> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/03/09/10-digital-marketing-trends-in-2015-that-will-boost-your-strategy/#1561e8792e4d\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes </a></u>, explains this change very well. &ldquo;Ever since Web 2.0, the writing profession has had a heyday. Anyone and everyone could become a publisher. Anyone who had a voice could also have a platform on the web.&rdquo;There will always be the need for great content creators, including writers, developers, video producers, podcasters, and speakers. <u> <a href=\"http://blog.visual.ly/five-b2b-marketing-trends-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Lizetta Staplefoot said it well in her Visual.ly article </a></u>: &ldquo;The need for quality content will spotlight the importance of professional writers.&rdquo;Great writers can be difficult to find. But it&rsquo;s no longer enough simply to find a &ldquo;great writer.&rdquo; You need to find a writer who knows your niche. The world&rsquo;s greatest writing skills don&rsquo;t count for much unless the writer possesses knowledge, ideally experiential knowledge, of his or her subject matter.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 21:28:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 21:28:34.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-of-2015s-biggest-digital-marketing-changes/\", \"post_id\": \"8056\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 21:28:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 21:28:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-of-2015s-biggest-digital-marketing-changes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8055\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3769\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-of-2015s-Biggest-Digital-Marketing-Changes-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"365\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450261800,"author_id":438,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3642,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"15 Ways to Grow Your Client Relationships Next Year","link":"15-ways-to-grow-your-client-relationships-next-year","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In 2016, all companies need to grow. They will pin their hopes on a variety of strategies for growth: acquisitions, new product or service development, penetrating new markets, and so on. But by December of next year, many won&rsquo;t meet their goals. You don&rsquo;t need to be one of them. This article shares a set of 15 proven strategies to make sure you grow your client relationships, regardless of market conditions or what your competitors do.</p><p> In your search for growth, don&rsquo;t forget that your best growth opportunities are right in front of you: Your current&ndash;and past&ndash;satisfied clients. They know you and love you already. They trust you. You can get a meeting with them. You know a lot about their issues.</p><p> I have found that the provider&mdash;you&mdash;can influence or control 70-80% of the factors that determine whether or not a relationship grows or shrinks. So here are 15 strategies, which you can influence, to grow almost any client relationship next year.</p><p> <strong>  1. Pick the right clients to grow. </strong>  Not all clients present an equal opportunity for you. Which of yours have the highest potential for expansion? Some factors to consider include: <br/> &bull; Does the client value outside vendors/service providers and build trusted relationships with them? <br/> &bull; Does the client face strong competitive and environmental challenges? <br/> &bull; Is leadership ambitious and do they have high aspirations for the business? <br/> &bull; Are they action-oriented? Or do they just like to plan? <br/> &bull; Is there a crisis that you can help them overcome? <br/> &bull; Do you have or could you build a relationship with a senior executive sponsor? <br/> &bull; Do you have a prior reputation for doing good work in the client&rsquo;s organization?</p><p> Support all your clients, but save your &ldquo;powder&rdquo;&mdash;your special investments&mdash;for those relationships with the highest potential.</p><p> <strong>  2. Deepen your relationship with a key buyer. </strong>  It&rsquo;s hard to grow a relationship without a relationship with a key buyer&mdash;an important executive sponsor. Do you have one? How&rsquo;s the quality of that relationship? What is your plan to systematically deepen it further over the next several quarters?</p><p> <strong>  3. Find a new buyer. </strong>  Most large corporations have multiple, major economic buying units&mdash;some global ones have 50 or more. Who else in the organization can buy what you offer? Which should be the next area that you penetrate? Even if you offer a functionally-oriented service, remember that not all the client&rsquo;s spend for that area is in the formal functional organization. Companies spend a lot on marketing outside of the marketing group, for example, and often 50% of a client&rsquo;s IT spend is outside IT.</p><p> <strong>  4. Expand your network in the client&rsquo;s organization.  </strong> Increasingly, decisions are being made by 4, 5, 6, or more different stakeholders in a corporate organization. The broader your network, the more information you&rsquo;ll have about the client&rsquo;s needs, and the more likely it will be that you can effectively align the key decision makers to your solution.</p><p> <strong>  5. Move up to the higher-level agenda. </strong>  The goal your work is focused on is probably a lower-level goal or a subset of a larger agenda. Can you connect to that higher-level agenda, which would give you a much bigger and broader canvas to work on with the client?</p><p> <strong>  6. Double your face time. </strong>  More face time means more familiarity, likeability, and trust. It invariably leads to a greater understanding of your client&rsquo;s agenda of key priorities. You don&rsquo;t need a brilliant idea to ask for a short meeting or to have a cup of coffee with someone. If it&rsquo;s a really senior executive, develop an idea or proposal for a meeting that they may find intriguing, or offer to share some special insight about their customers, their competitors, or a new best practice that is emerging.</p><p> <strong>  7. Identify the next burning platform. </strong>  The sale almost always goes quickly when the client perceives a truly urgent, &ldquo;Red&rdquo; issue. What could the next one be for your client? What do they perceive as the big rock they need to move this coming year&mdash;the next major challenge or opportunity? Give some serious thought and effort to identifying this for each of your highest potential client relationships.</p><p> <strong>  8. Offer an assessment or pilot. </strong>  These can be great, low-risk, low-key ways of jointly exploring an issue with a client who may not yet be ready to consider a large project or transaction. It&rsquo;s a small, low-risk step that&rsquo;s easy for a client to take and which could lead to something much bigger.</p><p> <strong>  9. Get multi-level feedback. </strong>  If it&rsquo;s an ongoing client, conduct a comprehensive client relationship review. Get multiple levels of feedback&mdash;for example: <br/> &bull; Have one of your leaders meet with the client&rsquo;s CEO or top functional executive (CFO, CHRO, etc.) <br/> &bull; Do a face-to-face, year-end relationship review with your key client contact <br/> &bull; Do an short online survey (e.g., Net Promoter Score, which utilizes only two or three short questions) of everyone who has worked with you and your firm over the last year</p><p> <strong>  10. Bring new players into the relationship. </strong>  Sometimes, we get complacent or just narrow-minded about the possibilities in a client relationship. Who else could you bring in from your firm to work on the account? Just having a new face with a new perspective can help surface valid ideas for growth that you may have discounted or previously ignored.</p><p> <strong>  11. Hold a joint, collaborative account planning session. </strong>  Why not invite the client to joint account planning session, under the banner of gaining a better understanding of their challenges and plans for next year so that you know how to best support them going forward? By the way, be sure to invite someone from your organization who is not actively involved in the account&mdash;having a detached, objective perspective during these discussions is invaluable. For example, he or she may very well ask some basic questions whose answers you are taking for granted&hellip;but which could open up a new and interesting dialogue.</p><p> <strong>  12. Invest to create a new perspective. </strong>  ROI has two parts to it: Investment, and Return. Are you only focused on the Return and not that motivated to Invest? Is there an issue or idea around which you can develop a tailored perspective for your client? All of my research shows that relationships grow when you invest in them. Pretty obvious, I know, but we often take our best relationships for granted.</p><p> <strong>  13. Connect around enterprise-level themes.  </strong> Step back from your day to day work with the client and ask yourself: Could you connect on some company-wide themes that may be above your day to day operational work with the client? These could include employee engagement, sustainability, globalization, digitization, security, diversity, and so on. Doing so will require you to get other parts of your own company involved. That&rsquo;s what creates a true &ldquo;B to B&rdquo; relationship&mdash;when every function has a relationship with their counterpart at the client.</p><p> <strong>  14. Leverage trigger events.  </strong> Make a list of potential &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; events for your client. Are they getting tired of their incumbent provider? Has the incumbent slipped up in some way? Has there been a reorganization? Has a new executive come in from the outside? Has a competitor made some bold moves recently? Is new technology transforming their business model? Is the client&rsquo;s industry consolidating? All of these things can trigger a desire to reallocate business among their suppliers, based on a perception of who is most capable of helping them deal with the new challenge.</p><p> <strong>  15. Treat them like they are already your best client. </strong> This is a simple but powerful strategy: Treat your client or prospect like they are already your best client. Lavish them with attention and value-added ideas. Invest to get to know their organization. Do everything in this list! If you choose the right client to start with, you&rsquo;ll be amazed at how effective this can be.</p><p> Relationships&mdash;in business and at home&mdash;usually either improve or deteriorate. They go forwards&mdash;or backwards. Rarely do they stay the same. Be intentional&mdash;it&rsquo;s your choice!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 21:40:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 21:40:35.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/15-ways-to-grow-your-client-relationships-next-year/\", \"post_id\": \"8058\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 21:40:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 21:40:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"15-ways-to-grow-your-client-relationships-next-year\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8057\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3770\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Build-Client-Relationships-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"709\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450335600,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3644,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Social Security an Entitlement?﻿","link":"is-social-security-an-entitlement%ef%bb%bf","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There is no question that one of the most polarizing and sensitive words in our political landscape these days is the word \"entitlement\". But when it comes to social security, is it fair to call social security an entitlement?</h3><p> <br/> I was recently giving a continuing education class to a group of CPA's when the topic of entitlements came up. In our group discussion one of the CPA's lashed out saying \"...how can anyone call social security an entitlement when you pay into it your entire working life...it's not an entitlement but rather a promise to pay back in retirement what workers funded during their working years\".</p><p> Although he makes a compelling argument, literally and legally speaking, social security is in fact an entitlement. For example, social security is Title II of the Social Security Act and Medicare is Title XVIII. So that's where the root of the word \"title\" comes from. Once you meet all the qualification requirements for social security then you are \"eligible\" for benefits. However, it's not until you actually file for and get approved for benefits that you become legally \"entitled\" to those benefits.</p><p> But popular culture and political rhetoric have given the term \"entitlement\" a bad name. It is often being connoted as some kind of government handout, like welfare and food stamps. These latter two programs are quite different than social security but, since all three are legally defined as \"entitlement programs\", social security also tends to bear the social stigma often afforded all entitlements programs.</p><p> It is correct to think that, although you did contribute into the social security system, you will likely end up getting more out of the system than you put it.  Could you have generated a larger benefit if you had invested your social security contributions on your own over your working years? Perhaps, but it's important to remember that social security was never set up to be an investment scheme. The system was originally set up to achieve a number of objectives, with a goal of balancing the benefits that individuals got out of the system along side what the country as a whole got out of the system.</p><p> For example, one of the major goals of \"social\" security was to raise the standard of living of lower income workers. To this day, social security uses a retirement benefit formula that is skewed to give lower income workers a higher rate of return (when comparing taxes \"paid in\" to benefits \"received\") than that received by higher income workers. By doing so, this has helped lift millions of seniors out of poverty. When FDR started the program in 1935, it was estimated that 80% of seniors in the U.S. lived below the poverty line. In large part because of social security that figure is less than 10% today.</p><p> There is no question that in many circles \"entitlement program\" has become a pejorative phrase, with the insinuation that people are getting something that they didn't earn or even deserve. The fact is, the use of the phrase \"entitlement program\" in government is simply a legal term for any government program guaranteeing certain benefits to a segment of the population who qualify for benefits under specific terms and conditions. In short, it has nothing to do with whether recipients are deserving, nor is it linked to a cost-benefit analysis on taxes paid versus benefits received. But in the highly politicized world that we live in, what words actually mean and the meaning given to words are often very different indeed.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 21:56:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 21:56:36.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-social-security-an-entitlement%ef%bb%bf/\", \"post_id\": \"8060\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 21:56:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 21:56:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-social-security-an-entitlement%ef%bb%bf\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8057\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3772\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Build-Client-Relationships-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2020\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450268100,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

Plenty of books were written &amp; conferences attended.</p><p> But, once the dust had settled, and HBR et al were talking about other topics, positive progress had been made. More CEOs made use of stories to communicate compelling visions. More innovative businesses brought together multidisciplinary teams to share knowledge through storytelling. One of the leading lights of this movement was a consultant called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stevedenning.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stephen Denning  </a> </u> .</p><p> Now a decade on, amidst the buzz about big data, decision science, content marketing &amp; disruption &ndash; you don&rsquo;t hear many people talk about narrative leadership. But a  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/analysts-storytellers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   focus on storytelling is reawakening  </a> </u> . In the early 2000s I had the pleasure of experiencing a leadership training course that included material from Stephen &amp; was captivated. The concept that humans are innately receptive to the telling of stories as a means of effective communication was self-evident around the world &amp; in so many different cultures. It was also captivating to imagine how the dull world of working in Financial Services could be enlivened by this more holistic style of leadership.</p><p> The book I recommend you read on this topic is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stevedenning.com/Books/leaders-guide-to-storytelling.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;The Leaders Guide to Storytelling&ldquo;  </a> </u>  by Stephen Denning. It&rsquo;s sub-title gives a clue as to the style of this tome: &ldquo;Mastering the art and discipline of business narrative&rdquo; . Whilst not always an easy read, partly due to the depth of what is shared &amp; partly to the polymath nature of the author, it is a treasury of practical advice on this challenge. Its one of those books I&rsquo;ve returned to several times over the years to refine my skills &amp; pass on storytelling tips to customer insight analysts &amp; leaders alike.</p><p> It is structured in 3 primary sections. Part one explains the role of story within organisations. Part two unpacks eight narrative patterns (story templates) that help with different leadership challenges. Part three covers what Stephen calls &lsquo;putting it all together&rsquo; or the challenge of how to apply this approach.</p><p> After the encouragement of the first two chapters, to be sure you are telling the right story (true, relevant &amp; helpful) and telling the story right (the performance piece), the treasure chest of this book is the 8 chapters that form Part Two. Using a mixture of evocative analogies and real world examples (including surprisingly short &amp; simple stories), Stephen shares templates for stories and approaches to creating them for eight different common leadership challenges:</p><li> <strong>  Motivating others to Action: </strong> A positive &lsquo;springboard&rsquo; story;</li><li> <strong>  Building trust in You: </strong> A turning point story;</li><li> <strong>  Building trust in your Company: </strong> A brand promise in action story;</li><li> <strong>  Transmitting your Values: </strong> A minimalist parable;</li><li> <strong>  Getting others Working Together: </strong> A moving account of shared experience;</li><li> <strong>  Sharing Knowledge: </strong> Problem solving stories with context;</li><li> <strong>  Taming the Grapevine: </strong> Satirising the rumour mill;</li><li> <strong>  Creating &amp; sharing your Vision: </strong> A future story. <br/>  </li><p> In each of these chapters, Stephen digs beneath the surface of the challenge to help leaders understand which approaches work &amp; which do not, plus the reasons for such behaviour. He compliments this with real life examples, practitioner tips &amp; a template for taking the storytelling approach recommended. In that sense this is much more than a book about storytelling, it is just as much a leadership textbook. However, true to its raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre, it delivers bite sized leadership advice through the medium of stories &amp; examples.</p><p> Although it might sound like the most relevant chapter for Customer Insight leaders is number 6 above, Sharing Knowledge, in fact all the leadership challenges above appear at different times for insight leaders &amp; their teams. That knowledge sharing chapter is also more focused on how to convey in a more interesting way rather dry technical expert knowledge learned through experience. The most relevant of all the stories to insight leaders and the one Stephen suggests leaders master first, is in fact the first one. Communicating insights in a positive way that motivates action in the business is perhaps their greatest challenge and one where a well crafted story can really help.</p><p> Which brings us to the closing part of this book. Across two chapters, one focussed on the challenge of how established businesses can innovate &amp; the other on a &lsquo;different kind of leader&lsquo; , Stephen passes on a great deal of leadership wisdom. The final chapter on being a different kind of leader is particularly inspirational and draws together numerous strands from throughout this book (our story). He advocates an interactive leadership model, one where the leader participates, connects &amp; communicates with different types people as peers; open to fresh ideas. If you exclude the manipulative models of leadership (from corrupt bureaucrats to spin doctors), he suggests to authentic models of leadership. The first is the traditional command &amp; control, or Napoleonic model of leadership. The second is an interactive model using narrative &amp; genuine conversations or Tolstoyan leadership.</p><p> Despite being 10 years old, this book is a real gem. In today&rsquo;s business world, with the challenges of content marketing, customer conversations, colleague motivation &amp; continual innovation &ndash; Stephen&rsquo;s advice sounds more relevant than ever. I heartily recommend this treasure chest as a book for the Christmas list of every  <u>  <a href=\"https://customerinsightleader.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Customer Insight leader  </a> </u> .</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-15 22:01:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-15 22:01:07.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-the-stories-you-tell-your-business-inspire/\", \"post_id\": \"8061\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-15 22:01:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-15 22:01:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-the-stories-you-tell-your-business-inspire\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8057\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3773\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Build-Client-Relationships-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"401\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450296000,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}

The husband worked for 10 years in London for a large American multinational in the technology sector, before he was offered an opportunity to move his family to the U.S. headquarters of the firm for a 3-year work assignment, with an agreement that he would have an opportunity for promotion to VP at the end of this time.</p><p> His initial assignment was tax-equalized, which included special allowances for housing and children&rsquo;s private school expenses, and he would be working on a temporary visa. He did eventually receive the promotion to VP, which required that he transition to a local hire in the U.S., and accept his company&rsquo;s help in securing permanent U.S. residency (green card).</p><p> &ldquo;We needed help with everything related to personal finance when we arrived &ndash; taking full advantage of my company&rsquo;s benefits and the 401k were the first order of business,&rdquo; the client said. </p><p> Since that time, the clients have thrived. The husband has flourished in the new VP position at his employer. Also, the entire family has thrived here in the U.S. They&rsquo;ve grown to love life in the U.S., and their kids, having arrived just before the start of high school, are at this point very much regular American teenagers (except that they&rsquo;ve traveled extensively and speak multiple foreign languages).</p><p> At this point, after living in the U.S. for approximately 6 years, the couple are actively pursuing U.S. citizenship for themselves and their children. The kids are planning for college here in the U.S., and the family expects to be U.S.-based for the rest of their lives, albeit with a vacation home in perhaps London or Paris &ndash; or both?</p><p> In the time that we have worked with this client, we successfully guided them through many unique planning decisions, including the following:</p><li> The decision to move foreign investment accounts to the U.S., improving returns and also obtaining more favorable tax treatment. In fact, we even discovered that they held some investment assets in an offshore account, which had not been previously disclosed to any tax authority. We helped them to transition these funds, which were not significant in amount, back into fully disclosed status.</li><li> A review of foreign qualified accounts, which could not be moved to the U.S. and had been performing poorly due to the insurance structure of the plan (very common in Europe). We were able to reallocate the holdings into a more aggressive and lower cost program.</li><li> Review of foreign real estate holdings, which included a family vacation home as well as a former residence that had been converted to a rental. We explained to them the unique tax shelter properties of income property in the U.S. due to depreciation, which they had not seen before. In doing this, we discovered that one of their foreign properties was not being reported to the IRS. However, because of foreign tax credits generated abroad, reporting this asset on their U.S. tax return did not generate any additional tax liabilities.</li><li> Review of new employer benefits available upon localizing in the U.S., including options, deferred compensation, 401(k), ESPP, disability and life insurance, etc. The client was concerned about giving up a generous defined benefit pension that existed in the multinational employer&rsquo;s foreign subsidiary, and therefore was very hesitant to localize into the U.S. and give up his foreign benefits. However, we were able to show him that the U.S. benefits, especially the executive level benefits that came with the promotion to VP, were actually superior to what he was giving up</li><li> Navigating the death of a parent and inheritance of foreign assets.</li><li> Review the decision to seek U.S. citizenship after being in the country for more than 5yrs</li><li> General planning for a retirement future likely to include partial residency in multiple countries. <br/>  </li><p> &ldquo;From the start, they looked at our entire worldwide picture when making decisions, rather than just focusing on our U.S. assets in isolation,&rdquo; the client mentioned and was a key theme that helped us solidify our relationship with the client.</p><p> If you as an advisor have any questions about cross-border financial planning and wealth management approaches, please feel free to contact us.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 14:47:43.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 14:47:43.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/key-lessons-in-cross-border-wealth-management-multi-national-citizen/\", \"post_id\": \"8063\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 14:47:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 14:47:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"key-lessons-in-cross-border-wealth-management-multi-national-citizen\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8062\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3774\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cross-Border-Wealth-Management.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"731\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450371600,"author_id":31,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3647,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Secret of Charismatic People","link":"the-secret-of-charismatic-people","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Science of People  </u> </a></p><p> In one moment I learned my first major secret to people. Let me tell you the story:</p><p> Back in college, I was standing talking to one of my favorite professors at the club fair. Dr. David Edwards was not only my psychology professor at the time, but he was also one of the most beloved teachers at Emory University. Everyone loved him and his classes were always full.</p><p> Let me give you a little background: at this particular moment I was at the peak of trying to escape from my awkwardness. I had realized that people skills were important, but knew that I lacked any kind of interpersonal intelligence. So I was on the hunt for help.</p><p> I was perplexed by people and befuddled by social skills. Dr. Edwards seemed to have a natural presence and charisma to him. I saw it the moment he entered the classroom or walked into the cafeteria. People flocked to him.</p><p> As I stood next to him in a moment of calm, I mustered up the courage to ask him the question that had been burning my mind for months:</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the secret to getting along with people?</h3><p> <br/> I was expecting him to ponder this quietly and tell me he had to take a few days and get back to me. After all, this question is the subject of hundreds of books and has plagued philosophers for centuries. But, Dr. Edwards didn&rsquo;t even take a breath before answering.</p><p> He pointed to a tiny, quiet girl standing along the corner of the gym. &ldquo;See that shy girl over there?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She has the most amazing story.&rdquo; Then he pointed to a jockish guy laughing with his friends at the entrance to the gym. &ldquo;See that athlete over there? He has the most amazing story.&rdquo; He continued to do this around the gym until I told him I got the idea.</p><p> A famous quote sums it up perfectly:</p><p> &ldquo;People are only boring when you fail to make them interesting.&rdquo; -Warren Bennis</p><p> Dr. Edwards had a huge hand in the work I do today because he taught me three fundamental truths about people:</p><h3> <strong>  Truth #1: No one is boring. </strong></h3><p> <br/> People have many layers. If you love yourself, a good metaphor for you is to think of people like an onion&mdash;rings upon rings of flavor. People also have a lot going on beneath the surface&mdash;think of an iceberg. Only the very tip is above the water for us to see. Some people might seem boring on the surface, but their story lurks just beneath the water.</p><li> The quiet person in the corner has the most to say. All you have to do is ask.</li><li> Everyone has an incredible story within them. All you have to do is listen.</li><li> You are awesomely charismatic. All you have to do is be interested. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Truth #2: You are responsible. </strong></h3><p> <br/> People who are good with people take responsibility. They don&rsquo;t passively participate in conversation hoping the other person will share something interesting. They actively engage, hunt and delight. The most charismatic people take responsibility in 3 ways. These are my 3 challenges for you:</p><li> Actively seek out someone&rsquo;s story.</li><li> Ask  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2013/10/helpful-conversation-starters/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   killer conversation starters  </a> </u> .</li><li> Listen hard and give purposeful responses. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Truth #3: It&rsquo;s about committing. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I am not a singer. I would like to be a singer, but I am definitely not one. I have absolutely no ear for beats, tunes or rhythms. This does not serve me well at Karaoke. In fact, Karaoke is something I avoid like a kid avoids frozen peas. Recently, I had no choice and was thrust into a Karaoke situation and signed up against my will. The song chosen for me? The Real Slim Shady by Eminem (do I look like a rapper to you?!) As I shakily took the stage, a friend whispered to me:</p><h3> It&rsquo;s not about your talent, it&rsquo;s about your commitment.</h3><p> <br/> And she was right. The best Karaoke singers aren&rsquo;t necessarily the best singers. They are the people who storm the stage, bust out dance moves and have a blast trying (yes, I did try to break dance and pop-lock during my &lsquo;rap&rsquo;, and I did get a big applause despite getting 80% of the words wrong).</p><p> If you show up thinking you suck or interact with people worrying you aren&rsquo;t good enough, that is exactly what will happen.</p><h3> You don&rsquo;t have to be impressive to impress people.</h3><p> <br/> Just show up ready to have a blast. Go in seeking stories. Actively interact.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 16:46:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 16:46:40.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-of-charismatic-people/\", \"post_id\": \"8065\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 16:46:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 16:46:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-of-charismatic-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8064\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3775\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Charismatic-People.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"831\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450364400,"author_id":498,"chart_url":""}

Share the purpose of the focus group; for you to learn how you can better address the needs of women. Be sure to call to confirm they will be able to attend and express your enthusiasm for this opportunity to learn from women</p><p> 4. Place a token gift at each place before the women arrive. A small chocolate, a bud vase with flower or something that reflects a woman&rsquo;s touch and shows your appreciation for their participation.</p><p> 5.  As the women arrive be sure to introduce them to each other, this is IMPORTANT.  I highly recommend name tags as this facilitates more interaction between participants.</p><p> 6.  If you assign seats (which can be helpful by positioning one of your best female clients next to a big potential prospect) be sure and put table tents or small name cards, this also makes it easier for women to talk with each other.</p><p> 7. Thank them all for coming and then reiterate the purpose of the presentation.</p><p> 8. Have each woman introduce herself and choose an open ended question that might add to the relationship building process. IE: Where you work, Where you live: even Your favorite hobby can create commonalities.</p><p> 9.  Once introductions are made and the women are warming up begin asking your questions, some typical questions might be:</p><p> What has been your experience working with a financial advisor?</p><li> Who has worked with a financial advisor?</li><li> What did you like about your advisor?</li><li> What did you NOT like about your advisor?</li><li> Who has had a similar experience? <br/>  </li><p> What prevents women from becoming more engaged with their financial affairs?</p><li> What would encourage women to become more involved?</li><li> How can an advisor make the process more appealing to women? <br/>  </li><p> What are the 3 biggest financial concerns you have right now? (Make sure they don&rsquo;t over think this question.)</p><li> How are those issues being addressed right now? (Be sure and write these down, they are important) <br/>  </li><p> If you had all the money in the world and could only spend it in 3 ways what would you spend it on?</p><li> This is what is considered their &ldquo;Purpose&rdquo; for their money not necessarily a &ldquo;Goal&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> When working with a financial advisor what is the most important factor and WHY?</p><li> The relationship you have with him (comfort and trust)</li><li> The performance of the investments</li><li> The fees <br/>  </li><li> Be sure and challenge them on this, asking others who would agree or disagree. <br/>  </li><p> If I hosted a series of events for women what are some topics you would find of interest?  (You may need to provide some suggestions to help them along.)</p><li> The importance of wills and trusts?</li><li> How to get organized?</li><li> How to put your financial plan to work?</li><li> What is a mutual fund and why should I care? <br/>  </li><p> What kind of environment would be ideal for these events?</p><li> Restaurant</li><li> Conference room</li><li> 25-50 women</li><li> Like today</li><li> At the golf course? <br/>  </li><p> If you could suggest just one thing that I should do to create a more female friendly environment what would you suggest?</p><li> Office space</li><li> Service</li><li> Events</li><li> Process <br/>  </li><p> If you have another women&rsquo;s event scheduled ask &ldquo;How many of you know other women that you feel would like to receive and invitation to my next event?\"</p><li> Example response: \"I will call you tomorrow to learn more about your friend and what would be the most comfortable way to include them on my invitation list.\" <br/>  </li><p> 10.

Think about it this way: when you are at the stage where the proposal is outstanding, the client is making up their mind and your CRM system says &ldquo;closeable&rdquo;, 90% of the of work, effort and energy have gone into the deal already.Yet, critically, a lot of sellers fail to deliver that last punch, that last little push the deal needs to get over the hill &ndash; thereby often unnecessarily losing deals to competitors or the dreaded &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;.In this post, I&rsquo;ll share 10 proven, helpful tips to increase last-minute sales wins. I&rsquo;ve used these myself, and my clients have used them in order to save major deals from going south and overcome seemingly impossible odds.When you&rsquo;re trying to close your next deal, and things are not going as well as planned, try these out for yourself, and see what happens.<h3> 1. Help Them Overcome Their Fears</h3>One of the major reasons deals are lost, especially to the dreaded status quo, is that buyers are simply afraid of acting and moving forward. They&rsquo;re afraid of making the wrong decision, allocating corporate funds to a venture that may result in failure, and tarnishing their own reputations and careers in the process.Often, these &ldquo;dreams of human failure&rdquo; start leading their own little lives, bringing important deals investments to a premature ending through endless ruminating and doomsday scenarios.Simply <u> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/insight-selling-success-5-simple-steps-collaborating-buyers-cluytens/\" target=\"_blank\">  helping your buyer voice their nightmare scenarios </a></u> can often be a major step in the right direction. In an open and honest conversation, ask them about what they fear most, and explain step-by-step how you will be able to help them reduce the risk, and address the issue if it does come up.<h3> 2. Help Them Make The Internal Sale</h3>In today&rsquo;s world, no one makes decisions in isolation. I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re mid-level manager or a Fortune 500 CEO &ndash; in 2015, no one makes decisions by themselves anymore. In an age of a more democratic workplace, fluid decision-making processes, matrix organizations and increasing risk aversion, decisions are made by committee &ndash; whether formalized or not.More often than not, your buyer has an internal sale to make &ndash; yet unfortunately, many times they are at a loss of how to do so successfully. In order to get the deal to close, your responsibility is to support them in whatever way to help them make the internal sale: coach them, provide additional information, contribute further analysis, engage in joint meetings, &hellip;Whatever it is, if you can help them close their sale, you&rsquo;ll vastly increase your chances of closing yours.<h3> 3. Show Them The &ldquo;Cost Of No Decision&rdquo;</h3>As human beings, our default mode of action is &ldquo;no action&rdquo;. If we can get away with it, we would much rather do nothing than risk even the slightest little bit, or have to expend even the smallest amount of energy and resources.No change, no loss. No gain, no pain.If you can help your buyers see what the cost of no decision truly looks like &ndash; in terms of lost potential, market share, revenue growth, risk reduction or whatever measure is applicable to your business &ndash; you will simultaneously increase their desire to take action, and take action immediately.<h3> 4. Offer Incentives To Action</h3>In addition to exploring the cost of no decision, use incentives to action to further expand the gap between where they are now and where they could be. The larger the gap, the more inclined the buyer will be to move forward.Try and offer incentives to action (note: I am not talking about discounting here) as a way to further encourage your buyer to move forward, and move forward with you.<h3> 5. Offer To Reduce Or Remove Roadblocks</h3>Sometimes, getting buyers to choose a path is as much about removing things as it is about adding things. Maybe it&rsquo;s providing a resource they don&rsquo;t have, but you could easily provide. Maybe it&rsquo;s a piece of knowledge. Maybe someone internally needs to be brought on board.Whatever the case, offering to reduce or remove roadblocks is a tried and tested strategy to increase sales wins at the last minute.<h3> 6. Show Them How To Get Started</h3>Very often one of the major roadblocks to getting started is that buyers simply don&rsquo;t have the resources to do so, or don&rsquo;t see how.Many buyers are cash-strapped, resource poor and lack the internal resources to get things underway. Meaning most buyers I know would jump at the chance of having a supplier take matters into their own hands, and offer to carry out the first steps to get a project started.Think about it like this: if you can show your buyer a smooth path for moving forward after they sign, you&rsquo;ll take away virtually every reason for not taking that path.<h3> 7. Do It For Them</h3>I once read somewhere that most people dream of becoming an entrepreneur.When asked what they mean by that, it turns out that most people want the perceived resultsof becoming an entrepreneur: wealth, prestige, financial independence and an opportunity to live a long and prosperous life on a sunny beach in a luxury villa. What they don&rsquo;t want is all the pain, effort, setbacks, worrying and failure that come before that result.In short, they want the result, but without the effort.The closer you can come to delivering the result to your client without them having to expend any effort, the more successful you will be (and, incidentally, the more you&rsquo;ll be able to <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN8mtAOSCbk&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUncpnetgfijL_ttMeZVwhTg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  charge for your sevices </a></u>).DIY is out. DI(F)Y (Do It For You) is in. <h3> 8. Offer A Strong Guarantee</h3>Many clients are afraid of being sold something that doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; and unfortunately, in some industries, they are right to be concerned. Stories of woe and failure are aplenty in corporate hallways: scopes blown out of proportion, budgets expanded to 2-3 times their size, &hellip;Regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re in one of those industries that have a &ldquo;bad rep&rdquo;, offering a strong guarantee is a great way of turning a sale into a close at the last minute.I&rsquo;m not just talking about &ldquo;money back guarantees&rdquo; here. Performance guarantees, offers to continue the work until it succeeds, &hellip; are all equally valid forms of offering a strong guarantee.<h3> 9. Offer A &ldquo;Deal Sweetener&rdquo;</h3>Sometimes, all it takes to get a client over the edge is a little, tiny push. If you can, offer a &ldquo;deal sweetener&rdquo; of sorts. (Again, I&rsquo;m not talking about an outright discount here).What I am talking about is adding something into the mix that is of value to them, of relatively little effort to you, yet makes a significant contribution to the overall value they receive.Is there something small that you can add into the mix, like some analysis, offering to include an additional management reporting session, run an internal workshop, conduct some ongoing reporting or a temporary increase in functionality ?Find something that is of value to your clients, of relatively little cost to you and offer to include it into the deal at no extra charge.<h3> 10. Stay In The Drivers Seat</h3>Ultimately, closing the sale is no one&rsquo;s responsibility but yours. It&rsquo;s not your clients. It&rsquo;s not your bosses&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s not your colleague&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s not the government&rsquo;s.It&rsquo;s yours.The sooner you realize that, the better you&rsquo;ll be at staying in the driver&rsquo;s seat and seeing things through until the very end (which, by the way, is not the signature of the contract &ndash; but I will expand on that in another post).In my experience, the strongest and most powerful way to increase sales wins directly is a seller who is willing to keep moving forward, keep encouraging their buyer to take action, removes all roadblocks and remaining issues until the final answer can only be &ndash; &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 20:33:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 20:33:12.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-powerful-ways-to-increase-last-minute-sales-wins/\", \"post_id\": \"8069\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 20:33:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 20:33:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-powerful-ways-to-increase-last-minute-sales-wins\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8068\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3777\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Last-Minute-Sales-Win.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"441\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450505700,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3650,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Creative Thinking and Making an Impact","link":"creative-thinking-and-making-an-impact","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What seems like a lifetime ago, in the summer of 2001, I got one of those crazy ideas (for those of you who know me, you know that this is not terribly unusual).  I was in Seattle at the time, running my corporate events company, and I found this breathtaking spot at the foot of Mt. Si for a 700 person picnic. The problem was, there were no picnic tables.  Now a sane person would say: (a) rent the tables, or (b) find a different spot &ndash; but as we&rsquo;ve already established I&rsquo;m known to doing things a little differently (I prefer to look at it as &ldquo;creative&rdquo; thinking).</p><p> The gorgeous site was owned by the City of Snoqualmie, a beautiful hamlet about 30 &ndash; 40 minutes outside of Seattle. They occasionally held concerts there, as the site was situated on a gentle sloping hill, but most of the time (since it was table-free) it was just one of those hidden gems that taxpayers had the privilege maintaining, but not using.</p><p> It was so perfect!  My clients would love it!  I had to have my Graceland-themed picnic there! Yes, imagine&hellip;Elvis and Priscilla making their grand entrance via golf cart down to the stage&hellip;</p><p> I tend to not only think outside-a-normal-box, but I&rsquo;m also stubborn (since I&rsquo;m outing foibles), and I just had to figure out a way to make it happen. That&rsquo;s when it struck me! What if&hellip; rather than renting normal tables that would stick into the grass and look out of place in the middle of paradise, we were to use the same amount of money and instead build gorgeous picnic tables to donate to the City of Snoqualmie??? Hmmmm&hellip;..</p><p> So of course, that&rsquo;s what we did. I sweet-talked my brilliant-recovering-engineer-husband into designing picnic-table-blue-prints, helping me order all the materials, and oh, also heading up the construction assembly-line (we were newly-weds at the time, so he was an easy target). I pulled together a team of extraordinary volunteers, we brought in Krispy Kremes and lunch, had the materials delivered, and we had an absolute blast spending a day in paradise building 100 gorgeous picnic tables that the City of Snoqualmie presumably still owns.</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t find this kind of thing in your normal business play-book.</p><p> So why, when my event-days are far behind me, do I find myself tripping down memory-lane? Well during the holiday season, I like to read business books that inspire me, and one of my favorites this time of year is Blake Mycoskie&rsquo;s,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Start-Something-Matters-Blake-Mycoskie/dp/1400069181/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323117237&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Start Something That Matters  </a> </u> .  He reminds me of the impact we all can make when we think creatively.</p><p> For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Blake, he&rsquo;s the guy who founded  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.toms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TOMS  </a> </u> . TOMS shoes breaks all the normal rules of business. They are a for-profit company that has making-a-difference woven into the fabric of their organization. While they started with a one-for-one model, focused on shoes (for every pair of shoes they sell, they provide a pair of shoes to a child in need &ndash; they have given more than 1,000,000 shoes away) they&rsquo;ve expanded to provide sight, water, safe birth, and bullying prevention to those in need &ndash; and are making quite a nice business out of doing so in the process. Yes, and the people who work for TOMS?  They&rsquo;re not simply &ldquo;employees&rdquo;, they&rsquo;re part of the TOMS &rdquo;movement&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  So how&rsquo;s that for engagement?! </strong></p><p> Now I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that making picnic tables and giving shoes away to children in need are the same on the awesomeness-scale &ndash; they&rsquo;re not. But they both do the same thing: they turn normal-thinking on its ear to make an impact. I was just trying to plan a company picnic &ndash; but discovered a way to contribute in the process. Blake had simply taken a trip to Argentina to lose himself in the culture, when he found a creative way to solve the real effects of being shoeless &ndash; on a big scale.</p><p> But you don&rsquo;t have to be in the position of owning your own business to make an impact. Anyone can do it. Especially this time of year.</p><p> <strong>  1. Define the impact you want to have. </strong>  One of the things we help leaders do is to define the impact that they want to have outside themselves. What is the purpose of what you&rsquo;re doing? Ask yourself: Why do you care? You do what you do for the sake of what? <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Get creative around the &ldquo;how&rdquo;. </strong>  Once you have some clarity around the impact you want to have, explore all the different tactics you could employ to achieve the impact you want to have. Pay attention to your intuition. It&rsquo;s those wild-hair-ideas that lead to something cool. Or as poet Anne Sexton once said, &ldquo;Put your ear down next to your soul and listen hard.&rdquo; When Blake first thought about getting shoes for children in need, he first considered turning to friends and family, then he explored starting a non-profit &ndash; but both of those solutions would rely too heavily on donations, and what if those dried up? It wasn&rsquo;t until he started thinking creatively that he realized he could use his entrepreneurial -know-how to create a new kind of for-profit business that could guarantee a flow of shoes.</p><p> <strong>  3. Focus on action!  </strong> We can spend a lifetime analyzing the pros and cons, the costs and the benefits, and find that we&rsquo;ve not made one iota of an impact. Impact comes through action, not thinking about action. Yes, do your &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; but give yourself a deadline, and take action.</p><p> <strong>  Impact comes through action, not thinking about action. </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. Fully commit. </strong>  In the theatre world we don&rsquo;t accept the word &ldquo;try&rdquo;. &ldquo;Trying&rdquo; allows for less than 100% commitment, which guarantees a bad performance. Actors have to be all-in, or can&rsquo;t be on the stage &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that simple. Now, committing to the action does not of course guarantee you will succeed, but it puts you on an active path to have access to achievement. No commitment, no achievement.</p><p> <strong>  Commitment puts you on an active path to have access to achievement.  No commitment, no achievement. </strong></p><p> This holiday season will be filled with big and little opportunities for you to make an impact. As a leader, how can you take the kind of creative action to inspire and engage your employees? Forgo the standard gift-card and really think about the impact you want to have on the individuals you lead. What is the impact you want to have on your friends and family this year? On your community? And no, it&rsquo;s not too off the wall to even say, the world. Buy a pair of TOMS shoes for someone? Get them a copy of Blake&rsquo;s inspiring book (which, by the way, provides a new book to a child in need)? Help a family in need?  Spend some quality time with someone?  Write a thoughtful handwritten note to let them know what a difference they&rsquo;ve made this year? There&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do. Get creative! That&rsquo;s where the real impact lies.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;m thinking that normal-thinking is  way  over-rated.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 20:41:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 20:41:52.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/creative-thinking-and-making-an-impact/\", \"post_id\": \"8071\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 20:41:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 20:41:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"creative-thinking-and-making-an-impact\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8070\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3778\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Creative-Thinking-and-Making-an-Impact-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"872\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450378800,"author_id":281,"chart_url":""}

What do financial advisors in these countries do to tackle major regulatory changes? Researching practice management from around the world and speaking to practice management colleagues in other countries, I found that while some of the concepts are similar, the implementation details and delivery to clients made the difference between average advisor and top performing advisor. The major regulatory change known as NI-31-103 or CRM II is not something that advisors can prepare for in a few hours. Depending on your business, there are several details to consider. Let&rsquo;s look at a list of the top seven steps to tackle CRM II from advisors who implemented successfully in other countries.</p><p> <strong>  1. Build a 1 year timeframe- </strong>  Project 100 (you need 50-100 hours to be properly prepared for CRM II- it will take as much as a year as you may need to have new discussions with all of your clients .It is called project 100 because you will need to spend 2-4 hours per week over 50 weeks in one year to on building and implementing key processes ( if you do not already have them) The first step is to plan them in your calendar each week 2-4 hours working on your business. Think how long it takes to write a letter to your clients. Plan the time first. For example every Wednesday from 8-11 am working on the business implementing processes. Work on your business, instead of in it. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Business models- </strong> your goals and lifestyle, or your business model . Does your business goals align with your lifestyle? Managing a large financial advisory business is great if it matches your lifestyle. Often coaching advisors, we have heard they want to manage 100-200 million. Then they want to slow down. It does not work that way. Find a mentor advisor that has the business and lifestyle you want to create. A question I ask in every workshop is &ldquo; how many ideal clients can you manage in a calendar year?&rdquo; Is it 50 , 100 ,150 or more? The research says the ideal capacity is 150 ideal clients. The next step is to define your ideal clients. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Ideal Clients- </strong>  An ideal client can be defined by the revenue produced. What is the ideal revenue in the first year and the ideal revenue on an ongoing basis? This is where I get different numbers depending on the advisors practices, which may focus on group benefits, wealth management or insurance. It does not matter what type of business you run, your ideal client has a revenue number. If your target is $6000 minimum recurring revenue per year and you have 100 ideal clients, then does that fit into your plans, and you can manage all of these ideal clients and build your ideal lifestyle? To learn more read the blog post &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.advisorpracticemanagement.com/blog/post/metrics-of-trust\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Metrics of Trust  </u> </a> &rdquo;  <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Client segmentation- </strong>  What is your ideal future client profile. Have it detailed, and do a case study and put it on your website for the world to see. A quick way to segment your clients is to add up the number of hours you work each year ,say 1800 hours. Then find out what percent of time you service clients. Segment the clients into 3 groups, A,B,C complex planning clients, basic planning and simple transaction. Then find out how much time you spend servicing each segment and add it up. Do you want to work more than 1800 hours next year? Another question I ask in every workshop I do is&rdquo; When Canadian investors see the fee for advice on their statement, will they expect more from their financial advisor? &ldquo; The answer is usually YES. The next question is the toughest &ldquo; how much more will they want or expect?&rdquo; If you have 200 clients and they all want, need or expect another hour or two updating plans, setting goals or helping them understand fees, then where is the 200-400 hours going to come from? Capacity is going to hit Canadian financial advisors hard in 2017 if they are not prepared. How long do your discussions about fees in dollar terms, not just percentages take? Do you have a scripted process for discussing fees in dollar terms as well as percentages? ( you should, check with your compliance office and or branch manager ) <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Client Feedback- </strong>  what clients value. Without client feedback, all else will be average. According to Businesshealth.com.au , only 15% of advisors in the United States have a formal feedback process for their clients. Those advisors that have a formal feedback system earn 52% more than advisors who do not have a feedback system ( Business Health Key Value Drivers US 2014) If you want to become a &ldquo;client centric advisor&rdquo; then build feedback into your client meetings and put it on the agenda. <br/> <br/> Build your Upfront Branded Value Proposition &ndash;VSP process &ndash; Value you bring, service you deliver and processes to implement with consistency. V for what clients value based on their feedback, a list of ALL your services and how you price your services. Then you need to articulate your value and all the services you deliver. I cannot tell you how many advisors cannot clearly articulate their value in a precise manner without winging it. The most important piece is the documented process that you use with clients to explain your VSP and having a detailed document to demonstrate your VSP. <br/> <br/> Build your Ongoing service process . As a client what do I get for the fee I pay each year? Consider re-engage existing clients with an innovative and detailed progress update process and adding more value and services. Then build a document to show clients your detailed process for delivering your value on a consistent basis by telling them about your process. If you do not have a process, then build one or hire someone to help you build one. <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Testing and implementing your NEW Value proposition discussion- </strong>  Test, test test. Before implementing any of your new strategy around CRM II ,test it with your staff, then test it with your clients to find the key details in demonstrating your value, services and price. Without key data and feedback, it is difficult to build a client centric financial advisory business. Ask clients some tough questions and testing by re engaging existing clients with your new VSP Value , service , price process. My mentor Bill Bachrach  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.billbachrach.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.billbachrach.com  </a> </u>  taught me that you can not get a black belt by watching Bruce Lee movies. You need to go and practice, practice practice. That is why it is called practice management. Practice articulating your script or process over and over before meeting your ideal client. <br/> <br/> Finally, when you are confident and ready, Implement changes and your new &ldquo;VSP process for existing and new clients with confidence. Every top athlete knows how important confidence is in their game. Get the confidence in your clearly articulated process and watch your clients transform in front of you with confidence. Innovation motivates both the advisor and the client. Ask yourself &ldquo;what did I innovate in 2015? Is it time to start innovating your business in 2016? By the end of the year, you and your clients can tackle CRM2 together and build a &ldquo;client centric financial advisory business&rdquo; built for them. <br/> <br/> <strong>  7. Define your future growth program-  </strong> How much capacity do you have left in 5 years? Going back to your ideal future client profile and how you are going to service your clients in the future, then determine the best way to grow your business. This is the number one concern for financial advisors from around the world. Capacity is a huge issue for financial advisors and their firms. Not only do advisors want to grow their business, underserving their clients is a major issue. Finding new clients is also getting tougher. The old ways have changed and the new ways of growing your business include positioning ideal referrals, client feedback forums, strategic networking and working with centers of influence. Mastering the art of client attraction has changed. Everyone has a financial advisor or two today. How can you position yourself to attract new ideal clients. The top advisors have a proven process of attracting new ideal clients which I teach to advisors, and will discuss in a future blog.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 20:47:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 20:47:18.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/seven-steps-to-tackle-crm-ii-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8073\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 20:47:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 20:47:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"seven-steps-to-tackle-crm-ii-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8072\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3779\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Steps-to-Tackle-CRM-II-in-2016.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"767\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450350000,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

This is often peppered with a lack focus and clarity, preventing you from taking necessary steps to creating change in your life. Your frustration about where you are and where you want to be is bound in feeling anxious and overwhelmed.</p><p> Allowing yourself to be stuck in the past and unable to make changes in the present leads to difficulty creating a different future &ndash; a future you need to create that is more aligned to where you really want to be.</p><p> Part of the problem with getting from point A to point B or from the present to the future is that we too often look at our current issues with the same lens. We ask the same questions. We attempt to solve problems in the same fashion. We don&rsquo;t consider other alternatives. We don&rsquo;t take actions that force us to work &lsquo;outside the box&rsquo;, mainly because whatever we did in the past worked. And, despite its current ineffectiveness in the present, we continue to walk down the same path.</p><p> Try thinking about it this way: if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. No wonder people feel stuck. One tool. One strategy. Few options.</p><p> But there is another option that works &ndash; a simple question that can put you on a different path.

What would you be doing, thinking, or believing differently about yourself that would indicate that a miracle occurred?</p><p> The great thing about this question is that it allows you to imagine how your life would be if something miraculous occurred. What would your life look like if a miracle occurred? What exactly do you want for yourself? What would you change about your life?

Work is a routine. You might even get bored. So how do you stay motivated to be nice to your customers? Before we answer that question, let me share an example with you to set up the lesson. </strong></p><p> I have a friend who is a very successful orthopedic doctor. He has a reputation for being really good at what he does, which includes both his ability as a surgeon and his bedside manner. One morning we were playing golf and with a couple of holes to go I asked what he was doing the rest of the day. He said he had a hip-replacement surgery to perform in about an hour. I asked him if he needed to leave right away. He said he was in no rush. The hospital was nearby and as long as he was there a few minutes early, he&rsquo;d have plenty of time to prep for the surgery. I asked if he needed to get psyched up for the operation to get his &ldquo;head in the game.&rdquo; He casually said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and proceeded to take his shot.</p><p> I was surprised that he didn&rsquo;t need to spend time to mentally prepare. Whenever I do a speech, which I assume is much easier to do than a hip-replacement, I need some time to get focused. How could he not need time to mentally prepare?</p><p> As my doctor buddy walked away, another member of our golf group came up to me and said, &ldquo;He does this all of the time. It&rsquo;s like carpentry. For him, it&rsquo;s as easy as a skilled carpenter hanging a door.&rdquo;</p><p> Carpentry? That&rsquo;s what a hip surgery is? As easy as hanging a door? I don&rsquo;t think so. But, the point is that it is mechanical. The doc does three to five surgeries a day, four days a week. That&rsquo;s at least 12 surgeries, if not more, each week, and if he does that at least 40 weeks throughout the year, he is doing at least 500 surgeries a year &ndash; for the last thirty years. That means he done at least 15,000 surgeries. I&rsquo;m guessing by now he&rsquo;s finally got it down. Okay, I get it.</p><p> So, on the last hole I asked him if he ever gets bored doing his &ldquo;carpentry&rdquo; work. He laughed and said, &ldquo;All the surgeries are pretty much the same, with the exception of the occasional problem. But, what&rsquo;s not the same are the patients. Each of them are different. They are all people and need to be treated as if they are the only patient I have.&rdquo;</p><p> And, there you go! He gets it. That&rsquo;s why his reputation is stellar. That&rsquo;s why other doctors refer their patients to him. He&rsquo;s a good surgeon &ndash; and a good person.</p><p> Isn&rsquo;t that what you want from the people you do business with? You want them to be good at what they do, sell a product that does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, and give you the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-experience-2/your-very-best-customer-service-experience/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer service experience  </a> </u>  you rightly deserve. And conversely, that is exactly what your customers want from you.</p><p> So, no matter how long you&rsquo;ve been doing what you do, no matter how many times you&rsquo;ve done it, no matter if you are bored by it or still get excited about it, each time you interact with your customer, it&rsquo;s your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-experience-2/digital-customer-service-opportunity-to-connect-with-customer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   opportunity  </a> </u>  to make them feel special&hellip; as if they are your only (and most important) customer.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 21:09:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 21:09:36.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-make-your-customers-feel-special/\", \"post_id\": \"8079\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 21:09:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 21:09:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-make-your-customers-feel-special\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8078\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3782\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Make-Your-Customers-Feel-Special-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"505\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450345500,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}

For many of us, owning our own home is a symbol of success. We remember the first house we bought, the years of forced saving which come with paying down the mortgage, and the increased cash flow when we don&rsquo;t have that expense in our budget any more. Now that you have finally got the mortgage monkey off your back, selling your house make any sense?</p><h3> Three Retirement Scenarios for Homeowners <br/>  </h3><p> If you are a homeowner approaching retirement, here are three scenarios to consider:</p><li> Sell your home early on to provide cash to fund your retirement years. Many people are in the &ldquo;house-rich and cash-poor category,&rdquo; and this scenario can make good sense for them.</li><li> Sell your house partway through retirement. This is scenario which typically occurs for most people, as they sell their home to fund some type of assisted living arrangement.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t sell the house at all. If you have sufficient other assets, you can continue to own your own home throughout your retirement. <br/>  </li><h3> Relocate to a Less Expensive Area <br/>  </h3><p> Your retirement dollars will go further if you move to a less expensive community. This is your opportunity to live in a different part of your city, province or even move across the country if you wish.</p><p> <strong>  Gain Access to Non-Registered Funds </strong></p><p> The money you make from selling your home is tax free and you can use them to open up a non-registered investment account. Once the account is in place, the money is treated differently from an RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) or a RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund). Both of these investment plans are fully taxable if you choose to withdraw funds from them. By having investments in registered and non-registered accounts, you will be able to smooth out your income during your retirement and still meet your cash flow needs.</p><p> <strong>  Budgeting is More Stable </strong></p><p> If you renting your home, you know what your fixed expense is each month. Homeowners must budget for expenses like the cost of a new furnace, roof, appliances, or any number of other things which need to be attended to. These expenses are along with annual costs, such as property taxes.</p><p> <strong>  Downsizing </strong></p><p> Selling a large home and buying a smaller one can make sense for a number of people. You may no longer need to hold onto the same size house as when you were raising a family. Keep in mind that once you take into account legal fees, the real estate commission, and property taxes owing, you may not end up with as much in your pocket as you were originally anticipating.</p><p> Can selling your house help you achieve a comfortable retirement?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 21:13:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 21:13:10.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-selling-your-house-the-key-to-a-comfortable-retirement/\", \"post_id\": \"8080\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 21:13:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 21:13:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-selling-your-house-the-key-to-a-comfortable-retirement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8078\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3783\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Make-Your-Customers-Feel-Special-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"563\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450382400,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

I can do everything else, but maybe that part could be assigned to Admin?&rdquo; Irritated, the supervisor looked at her and replied, &ldquo;The new-hire for this position will be handling all the social media.&rdquo;</p><p> As Bella and I talked about her awkward conversation with the supervisor, I asked why she was so afraid to learn the skills needed to get the new job. She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my 60&rsquo;s and I know they&rsquo;re going to hire someone younger who is more savvy.&rdquo;</p><p> My friend&rsquo;s self-talk is negative. She has self-limiting beliefs about her ability to learn something new because of her age.</p><p> The older we get the more we worry about looking silly, so our ideas tend to be conservative. But, if we don&rsquo;t continually exercise our brain, it loses it&rsquo;s ability to be agile and flexible. That makes it harder to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Strong-Mind-Counterintelligence-Empowerment/dp/1479134708/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370808962&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=secrets+of+a+strong+mind\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   strengthen our mind  </a> </u>  so that it knows how to deal with changes, obstacles, and adversity.</p><p> Bella needs to learn how to interrupt unconscious self-talk that is negative and generates fear, anxiety, and doubt. When we choose to let a negative thought have control, it leads to another phenomenon&mdash;helplessness. This is when you&rsquo;ve decided that nothing you do affects what happens to you.</p><p> When we control our thoughts and our beliefs about ourselves, and make them positive ones, we&rsquo;re gaining personal control. If helplessness can be learned, then it can be unlearned.</p><p> Every change we make in our lifestyle is perceived as a traumatic or stressful event by our brain. When we&rsquo;re stressed, the emotional limbic brain system becomes more active. We not only engage with our thinking cerebral brain less, we engage with the brain&rsquo;s language circuits even less. So when we&rsquo;re stressed, our expressions change as well as the tone of our voice&mdash;even our speech patterns change.</p><p> We can interrupt our brain&rsquo;s perception of changes in our lifestyle as being a threat if we are mentally tough.  <u>  Mental toughness </u>  is the opposite of helplessness; it&rsquo;s the ability to  <u>  change the way we look at things by our own power </u> .</p><p> There are many things in life that are beyond our control&mdash;our physical traits, race, the drought in Wyoming, our weedy gene pool . . . But we do have control over so much in our life. We can either take control or cede it to others.</p><p> When it comes to positive and negative feelings, the brain responds like an on-off switch: you cannot focus on both at the same time. We develop habits in the way we think, but habits of thinking are not etched in stone. Researchers like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learned-Optimism-Change-Your-Mind/dp/1400078393\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Martin Seligman  </a> </u>  have found that we can choose the way we think.</p><p> We can change self-limiting beliefs we have about ourselves. Here are some ways we can be bold:</p><li> Say things slowly so you can interrupt a negative thought before it&rsquo;s verbalized.</li><li> Observe the negative thought without reaction or judgment. Think of this as an exercise in meditation.</li><li> Consciously reframe the negative thought by shaping it into a positive one that has a solution-based direction.</li><li> Generate a minimum of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Positivity-Top-Notch-Research-Reveals-Change/dp/0307393747/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377474599&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=positivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   3-5 positive thoughts in response to every negative  </a> </u>  one you have. It takes almost twice as many positive thoughts to counter every negative one.</li><li> Think before speaking. Be fully present. Why do you tend to speak spontaneously or say whatever is on your mind? You may be tired, have poor communication skills, impatient, ego-centric, or self-absorbed.</li><li> Learn how to speak better. We are biased to think we are effective communicators, even when we&rsquo;re not. Record yourself in a conversation and then play it back. Or ask a trusted friend to give you honest feedback.</li><li> Learn empathetic listening by studying your own verbal inflections, read facial expressions, and  <u>  interpret body language </u> . <br/>  </li><p> Be bold with your life, don&rsquo;t play it safe. The way we think about our life controls it. Our thoughts are not merely reactions to events; they change what comes after. Like Bella, what you believe to be true about yourself becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.</p><p> How can you be bold and overcome your self-limiting beliefs?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 21:17:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 21:17:01.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/be-bold-playing-it-safe-can-ruin-your-life/\", \"post_id\": \"8082\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 21:17:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 21:17:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"be-bold-playing-it-safe-can-ruin-your-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8081\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3784\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Playing-it-Safe-Can-Ruin-Your-Life-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"775\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450422000,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3657,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Case of the Blackmailing CIO","link":"the-case-of-the-blackmailing-cio","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Deal Killer #4:  The Failure to Preserve a Company&rsquo;s Most Valuable Asset <br/>  </h3><p> Shirley Locke, ace Exit Planner, listened patiently as Chuck, a business owner and new client, proclaimed his eagerness to sell his company based on an unsolicited, yet attractive, offer he&rsquo;d just received. Like many owners Chuck felt ready to exit today and was certain that his company was as ready as he was. His had only one question for Shirley, &ldquo;Can you look over this Letter of Intent (LOI) before I sign it? It seems fine to me.&rdquo;</p><p> We&rsquo;ll follow Shirley&rsquo;s lead and save the discussion of the issues unique to Letters of Intent for another time and move instead to her first question: &ldquo;Can you tell me a bit about your company?&rdquo;</p><p> Shirley quickly zeroed in on the fact that Chuck&rsquo;s company had experienced extraordinary revenue growth due in large part to Chuck&rsquo;s decision (four years earlier) to hire a &ldquo;next-level&rdquo; management team. <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/case-blackmailing-cio#Reference1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a></p><p> Shirley then asked, &ldquo;Chuck, I&rsquo;d like to see the Covenant Not to Competes or Non-Solicitation Agreements that your new managers signed as part of their employment agreements.  Do you have them with you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Well no, because they don&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; Chuck admitted. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not really an issue. I pay this team very well and they&rsquo;re very happy.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I hope they are,&rdquo; said Shirley, &ldquo;but let me tell you the story of another owner who thought the same thing about his team.  I heard this from an investment banker, <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/case-blackmailing-cio#Reference2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [2] </a>  and I think of it as &lsquo;The Case of the Blackmailing CIO.&rsquo;&rdquo; Shirley had heard this story when she attended Boot Camp for Advisors&trade; from BEI Member and investment banker Kevin Short:</p><p> This owner was a week away from the sale of his company for $10 million when (at this very late stage of the game) the buyer met with each of the key managers to reassure them that they&rsquo;d be retained by the new owners at their existing compensation levels. At its meeting with the Chief Information Officer, the buyer was lavish in its praise of her performance and indicated how important her continued involvement was to the company&rsquo;s future success.</p><p> When the buyer then asked her to sign a covenant not to compete before the closing date, the CIO asked for a short break and headed straight for the owner&rsquo;s office. She reminded him that she&rsquo;d built (and maintained) the company&rsquo;s data warehouse and custom app allowing customers to access and change orders (one of the company&rsquo;s competitive advantages), and ever-so generously consented to wait patiently until the closing date &ldquo;to collect her $1 million bonus.&rdquo;</p><p> This owner paid the ransom because he knew that if his CIO, who alone managed the company&rsquo;s intellectual property, left the company, the buyer would likely scrap the deal. If the buyer did subsequently come to the closing table, it would reduce its purchase offer by far more than $1 million.</p><p> Chuck immediately understood the morals of Shirley&rsquo;s story, as will your clients. First, the story illustrated that replacing an owner as the center of the company with a management team is a critical component of creating transferable business value. As you know, buyers insist on this. Owners also understand, but can ignore, that with the relocation of management to the hub of the business, there is an accompanying threat: management team members can leave the company, compete, and take with them important relationships, customers, employees, vendor relationships and more.</p><p> Chuck realized, a little late in the game, that he should do all he could to prevent employees from harming his company, or his ability to exit, by creating enforceable covenants and agreements.</p><p> Shirley gently suggested to a somewhat chastened Chuck that he meet immediately with best-in-class legal counsel to create the necessary documentation.</p><p> We find that it is unusual for owners to create the safeguards necessary to protect their companies. It is equally unlikely that owners&rsquo; current advisors will suggest that they do so.  As a result nothing is done to protect the company&rsquo;s most valuable asset, but quite a lot has been done to create a potent Deal Killer.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t already discussed tying key employees to their employers with stronger bonds than feelings of good will, we suggest that you describe to your owner-clients the dangers of proceeding without such protections in place. Use Kevin&rsquo;s story above if you don&rsquo;t have one of your own.  And, if a client&rsquo;s legal counsel does not have expertise in employment law, it is your job as their Exit Planning advisor to recommend one who does. </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 21:23:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 21:23:51.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-case-of-the-blackmailing-cio/\", \"post_id\": \"8084\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 21:23:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 21:23:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-case-of-the-blackmailing-cio\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8083\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3785\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-1444146085469-2a4ef5a7e5fb-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"641\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450359000,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s stuck! Would you free it, to let it continue its journey?</p><h3> Tweenbots <br/>  </h3><p> The &ldquo;Tweenbot&rdquo; experiment says yes.</p><p> Every time a Tweenbot got caught under a park bench, ground futilely against a curb, or became trapped in a pothole, some passerby would always rescue it and send it toward its goal. Never once was a Tweenbot lost or damaged. Often, people would ignore the instructions to aim the Tweenbot in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; direction, if that direction meant sending the robot into a perilous situation. One man turned the robot back in the direction from which it had just come, saying out loud to the Tweenbot, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go that way, it&rsquo;s toward the road.&rdquo; &mdash; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tweenbots.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tweenbots.com  </a> </u></p><h3> Blabdroids <br/>  </h3><p> If you were to see a small box on wheels that asked you a question, would you answer?</p><p> The Blabdroid experiment says yes. The droids were send to parks, festivals and other crowded places. Interaction ranged from 8 to 30 minutes and people revealed very personal stories and things that you would not normally tell a stranger. Even when the robot told its interviewees that it was recording them for a documentary to be shown later. It asked questions like: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the worst thing you have ever done to someone?&rdquo;</p><h3> The 1944 Heider and Simmel Experiment on Anthropomorphism <br/>  </h3><p> We attribute human traits to objects. It&rsquo;s called anthropomorphism and it was established in 1944. At the time, two psychologists (Heider and Simmel) executed a now famous experiment with people watching triangles and other geometric shapes move about. Take a look at it and try to describe what you saw.</p><p> Some of the original subjects described the shapes as birds and a cage. Did you?</p><p> The role of anthropomorphism in robots serves a distinct purpose. It&rsquo;s not to build a humanoid, somehow we find these &ldquo;gemini&rdquo; too spooky. A person&rsquo;s response to a humanlike robot shifts quickly to revulsion when it only approaches a lifelike appearance.</p><p> Instead, robots are build in a way to take advantage of the mechanism to enable better interaction and acceptance. It&rsquo;s reflected in the shape, motion, and interaction of the robot.</p><p> Wall-e and Wirecutters</p><p> For shapes, many roboticists work with toy- or child-like appearances, that use rudimentary tools to convey expressions. These robots convey the Gestalt of emotion, and observers fill in the blanks. Think Disney&rsquo;s Wall-e, or take a look at the 9-minute movie &ldquo;Wirecutters&rdquo; (love that film)</p><h3> Jibo, the Family Robot <br/>  </h3><p> In the case of motion, facial expressions are amplified by a face that moves and eyes that follow you. Simple cues, like: follow the beige spot with your head, give us the impression that the robot focusses on us. The forerunner in this field is Jibo.</p><p> In the field of interaction, the latest technology is called Deep Learning. It stands for a type of search algorithm, that allows computers to learn by looking for similarities. You &ldquo;feed&rdquo; an algorithm a library of things you want it to recognize. And when confronted with new information, the robot will quickly reference its library, understand, and reply with other associations. Here, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook do the heavy lifting and they have published the code for others to use.</p><h3> Impact on Jobs <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s expected that all kinds of information gathering tasks will become robotic soon. But human social intelligence will take at least a couple of decades more.</p><p> Take a look the information your company gathers: from customer service and librarians to business intelligence developers. Parts of their jobs could be done better by robots we open up to. Particularly when robots can match our stories to cases of solved problems. It&rsquo;s when the algorithm becomes associative enough, not if.

Some things are possible tipoffs that they should get involved in helping monitor their aging parents&rsquo; spending, giving and susceptibility to scams.  Educating them about these signs gives the client the impression that you understand and that you care. Your Boomer clients may have parents or other relatives in their 80&rsquo;s, 90&rsquo;s and beyond.  You can help both clients and their aging family members stay safer.</p><p> Encourage them to watch out for these three signs when they see loved ones at their parents&rsquo; homes:</p><li> <p>  <strong>    Evidence of unpaid bills.  </strong>  Older folks begin to lose the capacity to keep track of finances very early in the process of any form of dementia.  If bill collectors are calling, or they see dunning notices, that is a red flag.  They could be forgetting what to pay or when to pay a bill.  Insurance can be cut off, utilities can be stopped and a lot of other consequences flow from this forgetfulness.  Adult children can help by offering to do the bill paying, putting it online or otherwise keeping watch over bills.  Your Boomer clients could be stuck with having to support their aging parents if the elders lose the ability to manage their money. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Too much &ldquo;charitable&rdquo; giving to anyone who asks.   </strong>   Scammers call seniors and pose as anybody from anywhere.  Unsuspecting elders believe them and do not check out the validity of the charity they claim to represent.   Remind your clients to caution their senior loved ones to ask for detailed information about anyone who solicits them, including name, address and phone number.  They should to call the charity and verify that the solicitation was from them. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Evidence of a new &ldquo;friend&rdquo; who seems overly involved in an aging parent&rsquo;s life,  </strong>  especially if he or she has access to personal information such as Social Security number, credit cards and bank accounts.   There are predators out there waiting for a chance to get to the money and run.   Particularly with a parent who has memory loss, manipulation and theft are all too easy for a person just hanging around waiting for an opportunity to steal.  At AgingInvestor.com we suggest that adult children closely monitor seniors&rsquo; accounts and question anything odd immediately.  <br/>    </p></li><p> Client education needs to be about more than what products will yield the best return and how to make money last. It has to be about your client&rsquo;s life too.  And since regulators want all advisors to educate clients about issues that affect them, this is one perfect for the educational effort.  Feel free to copy this email and send it out modified a bit, with your name on it.  Your clients will appreciate you!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-16 21:38:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-16 21:38:13.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/caution-your-boomer-clients-their-aging-loved-ones-may-need-help-handling-money/\", \"post_id\": \"8090\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-16 21:38:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-16 21:38:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"caution-your-boomer-clients-their-aging-loved-ones-may-need-help-handling-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8089\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3788\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Caution-Your-Boomer-Clients-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1290\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450368000,"author_id":91,"chart_url":""}

Each of your interactions can have an effect on your attitude.  </p><p> Smiles, laughter and positive news can lead to a good day while frowns, bickering and gloomy conversations tend to have the opposite result.  </p><p> From a brief piercing glare to a lengthy upbeat conversation, the influence on your attitude can oftentimes be surprising.</p><p> On the flip side, as a financial advisor, your attitude can also influence others.  </p><p> Walk into your office in an enthusiastic frame of mind and your staff will extend this feeling to your clients and prospects.  Call your top clients while in a rotten mood and even your very best ideas will be poorly received.</p><p> As a professional, you owe it to yourself and everyone around you to stay upbeat.</p><p> <strong>  Your attitude matters&hellip; </strong></p><p> And though it may sometimes feel as if you don&rsquo;t have control over your disposition &mdash; you do.  The key is to quickly realize when you are straying from a productive frame of mind and get back on track.  </p><h3> \"It isn&rsquo;t always easy, but when you stop to reflect on your blessings or visualize impending success, your stress will go away and your outlook will improve.\" <br/>  </h3><p> It isn&rsquo;t always easy, but when you stop to reflect on your blessings or visualize impending success, your stress will go away and your outlook will improve.</p><p> Over the years, I have witnessed a number of simple &ldquo;attitude adjustment&rdquo; techniques.  Each is based on the concept that success is derived from a positive frame of mind.  </p><p> From time to time you simply need to take a step back before moving forward.</p><p> <strong>  Count your blessings </strong>  &mdash; Never take for granted the many good things which abound in your life.  Family, friends, good health, freedom and opportunity &ndash; just to name a handful.  Whatever has you down is more than outweighed by your blessings.  Close your eyes and visualize a fond experience or successfully achieving something you are working toward.  This simple diversion can be a quick cure for the blues.</p><p> <strong>  Listen to your favorite song </strong>  &mdash; If music soothes the savage beast, it could certainly be a good tool for calming a rattled financial advisor. Dedicate a few songs on your iPhone to this purpose and keep it in your briefcase so you can pull it out when you need a lift.</p><p> <strong>  Take a walk </strong>  &mdash; If a little physical exertion would be a better remedy, simply get up from your desk and take a walk.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is around the office or around the block; the key is to do it right away.  The more you put it off, the longer your problems will fester.  Alternatively, if you enjoy a daily workout, this might be a good time to head to the gym.</p><p> <strong>  Call a friend or mentor  </strong> &mdash; Most of us have a friend or mentor who can help us stay on track.  If you have such an ally, give them a call if you need a lift.  Whenever possible, keep it brief so you can get on with your day.  (Caution:  If this person is merely someone with whom you will commiserate and make the problem worse, find somebody else.  Two negatives do NOT make a positive.)</p><p> <strong>  Help someone else </strong>  &mdash; Some of us find the act of helping someone else to be uplifting.  Perhaps you have an assistant, a junior advisor or co-worker who looks to you for inspiration.  Allow them to help you when you are down by finding a way to give them a word of encouragement.  You will probably end up taking your own advice.</p><p> <strong>  Circle the block </strong>  &mdash; Some advisors start their days in a lousy frame of mind.  The morning commute or worrying about all that needs to be done causes an anxiety that could doom the entire day.  If this happens to you, circle the block or take a different route to the office.  Try not to enter your office in a funk, your &ldquo;dark cloud&rdquo; will be obvious to those who work around you.  Use the extra drive time to mentally organize your day as a series of opportunities and challenges in which you are excited to engage.</p><p> <strong>  Read some words of inspiration </strong>  &mdash; A book with inspirational quotes, your bible, a favorite poem or a cherished letter come to mind as potentially calming texts.  Keep your inspirational reading in your desk drawer.  When the stress of the day makes you feel like your attitude is beginning to wane, close your office door, put your phone on &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; and spend 10 minutes refreshing your mind.</p><p> Though at times it is easier said than done, catching yourself before you let a bad attitude get the best of you can be a solution for greater productivity and more fun.  </p><p> Next time you find someone or something bringing you down, put one of these simple ideas to work.  </p><p> Your relationships and your business will all be better off because of it.</p><p> What are some of the things you do to maintain a positive attitude?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-17 19:37:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-17 19:37:31.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/attitude-matters-7-tips-for-getting-more-out-of-each-day/\", \"post_id\": \"8092\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-17 19:37:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-17 19:37:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"attitude-matters-7-tips-for-getting-more-out-of-each-day\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8091\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3789\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Attitude-matters-7-Tips-for-Getting-More-out-of-Each-Day-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"682\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450447200,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}

That&rsquo;s down 38% from a peak of $72.5 billion in 2006. Doing a quick math addition, that means banks are lending about 30 BILLION less in small business loans. That&rsquo;s a mighty sum. If banks are lending less, what is a small business owner to do?</p><p> While that fact may seem like the tolling of the bells for small business investing, it really doesn&rsquo;t. There are lots of viable, and frequently less-expensive alternatives. We&rsquo;ve had tremendous success at helping clients raise millions of dollars  ear using the following methods. Think of them as StartupConnection&rsquo;s &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; kind of financing.</p><li> Help businesses create a viable business plan, a requirement for any sort of financing. (We&rsquo;re always surprised at how many clients cannot answer basic questions like: How much money do you need? What are you going to do with the money? How will you pay it back?)</li><li> If asked, suppliers are frequently willing to help with financing a startup business by things like financing and holding inventory, reducing production times, and shipping direct. There are new techniques in business today that can assist a startup, that are efficient, and may not mean a big investment by business owner and supplier.</li><li> While credit card interest can accrue (and be expen$ive) if not paid off right away, they do offer a startup business a 30-day free program, or zero interest for sometimes up to 18 months with a new account.</li><li> Follow the 80-20 rule. That is: 80% of your sales will be with 20% of your products and customers. (We have helped virtually every client significantly reduce inventory and increase sales by selling off losers and having the winners in stock.)</li><li> Better planning reduces inventory. Your better sellers frequently have consistent sales which allows you to more accurately forecast orders and deliveries. That, in turn maximizes order quantities, and minimizes leftovers.</li><li> If the business is profitable and growing, you can frequently finance the growth with working capital from profits. This also means giving up less equity.</li><li> Selling on the internet (especially Amazon) can be a viable way to increase sales, increase margins and avoid receivables.</li><li> Bartering, alliances and exchanges are viable methods to get both excellent services and save cash.</li><li> Crowdfunding and angel investing are easier to become a part of, and have become significant and viable sources of funds. But, my advice? Get an expert to help you. <br/>  </li><p> These methods are available in one form or another for every new business. What&rsquo;s needed is understanding how they work, keeping an eye on these programs as your business grows, and be open to these alternative tried and true methods.

I remember growing up with jars full of a mixture of buttons; some vintage, many leftover from a sewing project and a few with a story. It was always a treat when my mom would let me select buttons to use for a craft project and one of my favorite things to do was make pretty cards and tags by gluing buttons onto the paper. Bringing that memory back to life, I tasked our team member Jessica (who also grew up with large jars of buttons) to make a set of button gift tags while I was on a business trip last week. Needless to say. . . I was delighted at the results. These gift tags made from buttons and little cut felt pieces are just delightful! She used a tag punch to make custom colored tags and added the details to the punched metallic paper.  This is such a fun inspiration as a project you can make with your kids. You can pre-cut the felt pieces and let them create their own mini art pieces.

{"original_id":3665,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Setting and Getting to Your Goal","link":"setting-and-getting-to-your-goal","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Dave Kohl, professor emeritus at Virginia Tech, says that <strong>  people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetimes as the people who do not. </strong> <strong>  However, 80 percent of Americans say they don&rsquo;t have goals. Additionally, there is another 16 percent of Americans who say they do have goals, but they don&rsquo;t write them down. Fewer than 4 percent of Americans write down their goals, and fewer than 1 percent actually review them regularly. </strong></p><p> Thus, while it&rsquo;s important for business leaders to have goals, they also need to set activities so the goals can be met.</p><p> I worked with the leader of a Business Development (bus-dev) team who was frustrated for more than a year and a half. Three years before, his CEO announced a heartfelt goal: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s triple topline results, double profitability and earn a 200 percent bonus in year five.&rdquo;</p><p> The goal was a stretch but not out of reach. Company sales had been strong and were getting stronger as familiarity with their new product grew. Marketing efforts were focused on reinforcing and supporting sales. Return on Investment (ROI) was measured, and their overall strategies&mdash;with a few tweaks here and there as needed&mdash;were working.</p><p> The bus-dev leader revisited the actual numbers and weighed them against the planned numbers for his six-person team. They showed they were behind in meeting the goal. Apparently, one person he was counting on to help drive the team&rsquo;s success had not been fully engaged for at least a year. The leader knew this person had faced some personal challenges, but had hoped his &ldquo;top gun&rdquo; would come out of it.</p><p> What happened?</p><p> When the CEO set the goal three years ago, everyone was thrilled at the prospect of achieving a 200 percent bonus. Everyone on the bus-dev leader&rsquo;s team committed to be accountable to and reinforce one another for the duration. While this is great, the reason a key player is disengaged is because while the goal may have been realistic, there was no plan in place to get to those results.</p><p> In order to achieve goals:</p><li> Everyone on the team must have a purpose. (Making money is not a purpose. It is a result.)</li><li> The work must be something each member is good at and enjoys doing.</li><li> The team must share the same values and the same work ethic.</li><li> They need to ask:</li><li> &ldquo;Do we count on each other for expertise?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Do we have each other&rsquo;s back?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Do we have unconditional trust?&rdquo;</li><li> Team members must engage in activities that support goals, rather than get distracted by the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; around them.</li><li> They need to determine if they are focused on the right activities:</li><li> &ldquo;Do we fret about the end dollar-sales every day, or do we focus on the front-end funnel of prospects and customers?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Do we meet weekly to review results?&rdquo; If so, are we honest with each other or are we all talk about &lsquo;the possibilities&rsquo; of a prospective customer versus taking a more pragmatic view, such as &lsquo;I met a prospect with an ongoing need for a multi-million piece purchase. I have a second meeting to get to know the customer next week.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Do we go to networking functions attended by people whom we want to engage in business, or do we just happen to like the buffet?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> If you want results, you must make them happen. The results you want simply won&rsquo;t happen to you. Simply setting a goal and being excited about it won&rsquo;t get you there. Get focused on your goals, but also focus on the realistic activities to achieve them.</p><p> Remember:</p><li> Set timeframes to complete these activities.</li><li> Meet weekly to review results. Learn what&rsquo;s working, what&rsquo;s not, and what you need to do differently. Collaborate!</li><li> Get realistic and objective about your results rather than hopeful and wishful. &ldquo;Hoping&rdquo; and &ldquo;wishing&rdquo; are not strategies and they are not implementation. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The choice is yours! </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-17 20:04:37.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-17 20:04:37.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/setting-and-getting-to-your-goal/\", \"post_id\": \"8100\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-17 20:04:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-17 20:04:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"setting-and-getting-to-your-goal\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8099\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3793\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Setting-and-Getting-Your-Goals-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"658\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450469700,"author_id":458,"chart_url":""}

Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to sleep at night knowing that if something should happen to you, the people you love will be taken care of?</p><p> Prior to speaking to an estate planning attorney, you should take a moment to write down and answer the following difficult, yet often overlooked questions:</p><p> <strong>  1. Have I listed my passwords and security codes for my accounts?  </strong> In the digital age it is easy to accumulate a notebook full of account usernames and passwords for online banks, social media sites and investment institutions.

If you should fall into a coma or suffer a traumatic brain injury, what do you want to happen? Without explicit instructions, your family may not know what to do.</p><p> <strong>  3. Who will look after Fido after I die? </strong>  Do you have a dog, cat, bird or other pet? Have you thought about what might happen to him or her after you die?

Evaluate some of the big things you spent money on and ask yourself, is there a way you could cut back on certain expenses? Can you cut costs entirely to make room for other priorities? Now may be a good time to renegotiate rates, especially car insurance and cellphone bills.</p><h3> Plan for the Big Stuff <br/>  </h3><p> While you&rsquo;re updating your budget, think about big expenses in your future. For some big ticket purchases, you can plan ahead before they happen. If you&rsquo;ve talked about  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/saving-down-payment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a new home  </a> </u> , car, or perhaps even addition to the family, then you know you need to plan.</p><p> If your big purchase is a down payment, for example, consider getting pre-approved for a mortgage to determine how much house you can afford, and how much your monthly mortgage may be. Keep in mind all of the extra costs associated with owning a house, including additional utility costs, extra insurance costs, and home maintenance expenses.</p><p> Create a list of action steps you need to take, and map out what you&rsquo;ll do month by month so you&rsquo;ll be financially prepared for a big purchase or investment.</p><h3> Evaluate Your Income <br/>  </h3><p> To get ahead with your money in 2016, you need to focus on more than just updating your budget and planning for expenses. You also have to consider how you&rsquo;re going to increase your income this year.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re an employee, you might start by creating a plan for how you&rsquo;ll earn and  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/4-steps-for-negotiating-your-next-pay-raise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ask for a pay raise  </a> </u>  in 2016. You might also consider transitioning to a new position or a new company.</p><p> If you  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/retirement-plans-for-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   run your own business  </a> </u> , make time before the new year to do some serious business planning. How will you increase your revenues in 2016? Do you want to take on more clients or focus on raising your value proposition with current gigs (and therefore, increasing your rates)?</p><p> Additionally, make sure a portion of your income goes toward  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/401k-vs-roth-ira-which-is-right-for-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   savings and investments  </a> </u> . You should aim to contribute at least 10% of your gross income to retirement accounts to develop a sound financial future.</p><h3> Evaluate Important Life Transitions <br/>  </h3><p> If you received an increase in income over the past year, added a new family member, or made any major life changes, consider reviewing  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/property-and-casualty-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your current life and disability insurance  </a> </u> .</p><p> No one wants to think about the worst case scenario, but you have to consider the possibility that your family may need income if you&rsquo;re  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/case-for-millennials-to-have-a-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   incapable of working  </a> </u> . If you&rsquo;re the breadwinner for your family, you need to consider having a life insurance policy that will cover your dependents for several years if you stopped working.</p><h3> Start Now! <br/>  </h3><p> The best thing you can do for yourself today is to take a look at your finances, evaluate where you are and determine where you want to be, and create a list of actions to take to get you there. It&rsquo;s all about planning now &mdash; so don&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;re breaking out your new calendar to consider how you&rsquo;ll improve your money situation.</p><p> By taking steps now to get ahead of your finances, you&rsquo;ll set yourself up on the right path for making a great 2016.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-17 20:30:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-17 20:30:49.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/get-financially-ahead-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8106\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-17 20:30:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-17 20:30:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"get-financially-ahead-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8105\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3796\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Get-Financial-Ahead-in-2016-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"394\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450458000,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3669,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Sales Presentation Ideas to Rock Your Next Dog and Pony Show","link":"5-sales-presentation-ideas-to-rock-your-next-dog-and-pony-show","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_burdon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mark Burdon  </a> </u> | <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   HireVue  </u> </a> Have you ever showed up to give a sales presentation with a spring in your step, the feeling you were about to hit a home run with a  <u>  sales prospect </u> , and then end up striking out in front of a really tough audience? Would the sound of crickets chirping be a welcome break from the silence which is your \"room\" of prospects?Here are seven ideas which will help you deliver an engaging presentation which will help you move the needle on your sales pipeline to the win column.</p><h3> 1. TELL GOOD STORIES, DON'T READ THEM</h3>Have you ever been in the audience of a presentation where the slide deck was packed with words, and you started to wonder why the presenter even showed up and didn't just send the presentation with a recorded voice? The best <u> sales presentations</u> have visual aids with graphs, images and hey..even memes which add context to your pitch. The reason which wordy slide decks can cause a silent audience after a while is that everyone is reading along with you, making sure you get all the words right!Take a page out of the books of SEO writers. Have a single word or phrase on each slide which<li> Inspires emotion</li><li> Demonstrates you've done your research</li><li> Drives home the point of the slide you are working with, but keeps your audience hanging on the rest of the words you are saying</li><h3> 2.   TUNE IN TO WIIFM</h3>When you are delivering your presentation, don't make it all about you. Why not save a few minutes to articulate what you know about your customer, and what you know about them. That can set the stage for you to pitch your value proposition relative to the customer's needs. Fact is,everybody loves to hear bout themselves, not to mention you get a great opportunity to <u> <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2014/02/how-to-make-good-sales-pitch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  build their business case </a></u> for them to buy your products or services.Make sure spend a good deal of the presentation tuned into \"WIIFM\" or \"What's In It For Me\" (from your customer's perspective)Check out social media, check your CRM system for their previous interactions with your company, and do some other leg work to find out why your customer needs your stuff. If you have a customer success story which tells a similar story to what your customer is facing, it will knock their socks off.<h3> 3. LEARN TO LOVE OBJECTIONS</h3>If you are getting objections during your presentation, treat them as proof your audience is listening to you. Leverage the <u> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/02/reinvent-your-sales-process-while-still-hitting-your-numbers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  objection handling skills </a></u> you learned in Sales School.<li> Confirm that you understand the objection</li><li> if possible, address the objection with tact, confidence and using examples</li><li> Ask the customer if you have addressed their objection</li><li> If you have addressed the objection, ask for permission to continue</li><li> If not, ask if that objection could be resolved, if they would be willing to do business with you</li><h3> 4. DON'T OVERLOAD YOUR AUDIENCE WITH DATA</h3>There is a fine line between thorough and excessive when it comes to presentations. It's like watching Game of Thrones on HBO compared to reading the novels. The customer can be more engaged by the story and the potential benefits of your solution if they don't have to wade through a bunch of information which isn't really that important to them.If you are at the presentation stage, and you don't know what the benefits your customer is looking for, you probably didn't do your homework. Don't assume you know the return your customer is looking for, use their words if at all possible.<h3> 5. FINISH STRONG WITH A CALL TO ACTION</h3>Even after a great pitch, it can be tempting to thank your customer for their time and attention, shake hands, collect your gear and ride off into the sunset, hoping the customer will call and send an order. Truth is, sometimes you need to lead a horse to water to make them drink. Ask the customer if you have met their objectives with your presentation, and if the answer is yes, say you are interested in their business, and ask if they are interested in doing you the honour of contracting with you.You don't have to go aggressively after the business, just make sure you are at a point where the customer knows you are interested in working with them, that they are confident you can deliver what they need, and there is no question in the customer' mind as to how they can do business with you. Identify the key points of contact on both sides, define any action items, and leave the meeting with clear objectives for next steps.If you need practice with delivering a great presentation, and follow up call to action to decision makers, why not practice on your boss, or other company executives and get some feedback on your delivery?","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-17 20:53:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-17 20:53:31.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-sales-presentation-ideas-to-rock-your-next-dog-and-pony-show/\", \"post_id\": \"8108\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-17 20:53:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-17 20:53:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-sales-presentation-ideas-to-rock-your-next-dog-and-pony-show\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8107\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3797\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Sales-Presentation-Ideas-to-Rock-Your-Next-Dog-and-Pony-Show-copy_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1136\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450467900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

For those unfamiliar with the  Star Wars  movies (is that possible?), it turns out that Vader wasn&rsquo;t even that bad of a guy, actually.</p><p> But beyond that, he was a seriously effective leader. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Here are leadership qualities you can learn from the famous dark lord:</p><h3> 1. He held his people accountable <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_2\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_2.gif?t=1450381202925&amp;width=400\"/> <br/> SOURCE: wordpress.com</p><p> When an Imperial officer informed the dark lord that his men had lost Han Solo and company in an asteroid field, Vader was swift in his judgment and response. Disappointed by the failure of his subordinate, Darth Vader used the Force to choke Captain Lorth Needa to death. </p><p> When things don&rsquo;t go as planned, leaders need to figure out the next course of action as quickly as possible. In addition to doing precisely that, Vader showed the rest of his staff exactly what they could expect to happen to them should they fail similarly. Though I wouldn't suggest you go to the same extreme as Vader did.</p><h3> 2. He made sure projects wrapped up quickly <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_3\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_3.jpg?t=1450381202925&amp;width=400\"/> SOURCE: imgur.com</p><p> The famous Death Star, the huge globe-like intergalactic battle station that could destroy an entire planet with a single shot, was actually the second iteration of such a machine. </p><p> The first Death Star was destroyed earlier. Not to worry: Darth Vader used his workflow optimization and people management skills to accelerate construction on the second Death Star, bringing the product to market way ahead of schedule &mdash; and presumably under budget too. It&rsquo;s a shame those pesky rebels destroyed it yet again.</p><h3> 3. He could land a meeting with anyone <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_4\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_4.gif?t=1450381202925&amp;width=400\"/> SOURCE: giphy.com</p><p> When Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia went to Cloud City to meet up with Lando Calrissian, they weren&rsquo;t expecting to see Darth Vader waiting for them in a dining room. Great leaders are able to make an audience with the exact folks they&rsquo;re looking for, no matter where they happen to be in the universe.</p><h3> 4. He was an effective communicator <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_5\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_5.gif?t=1450381202925&amp;width=400\"/> SOURCE: giphy.com</p><p> On Cloud City, Vader and Luke fought each other. During the battle, Vader cut off Luke&rsquo;s hand. But he also gained something very important, knowledge communicated so eloquently and concisely when Vader said, &ldquo;Luke, I am your father.&rdquo; </p><p> Successful leaders have spectacular communication skills. More importantly, they don&rsquo;t beat around the bush. Vader didn&rsquo;t tell Luke the story about how he met his mother and everything else; he simply cut to the chase, saving everyone&rsquo;s time while conveying his message.</p><h3> 5. He was always recruiting <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_6\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_6.gif?t=1450381202925&amp;width=400\"/> SOURCE: rebloggy.com</p><p> Though Luke was fighting against the dark side, Vader didn&rsquo;t stop trying to get him to fight alongside him. Vader knew that with Luke on board, the Sith would have a much easier time accomplishing their objectives &mdash; however nefarious they happened to be. </p><p> Today, there&rsquo;s no shortage of companies poaching top talent from their competitors in the business world. Even in the most stressful and violent of circumstances, Vader was always thinking about making his team stronger.</p><h3> 6. He never forget where he came from <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_7\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/6_Enduring_Leadership_Lessons_from_Darth_Vader_7.gif?t=1450381202925&amp;width=400\"/> SOURCE: giphy.com</p><p> It&rsquo;s true that Darth Vader, born Anakin Skywalker, started off as a good guy before becoming a ruthless murderer hell-bent on dominating the galaxy. But he ultimately realized the follies of the dark side and ended up dying as a good, honorable man. </p><p> Strong leaders never forget who they are. They don&rsquo;t let wealth, perks, or prestige change their personality. Vader did stumble for a bit there &mdash; like any cyborg might &mdash; but in the end, he remembered what was most important.</p><p> <strong>  May the Force be with you and your workforce! </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-17 20:59:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-17 20:59:46.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-enduring-leadership-lessons-from-darth-vader/\", \"post_id\": \"8110\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-17 20:59:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-17 20:59:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-enduring-leadership-lessons-from-darth-vader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8109\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3798\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Darth-Vader-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1666\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450472400,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

But if you have all that, chances are you don&rsquo;t need a brand-name publishing house although you might still want the cachet of their brand attached to yours.</p><p> <strong>  So avoid the beginner&rsquo;s mistake. Don&rsquo;t worry about your audience AFTER you&rsquo;ve written your book, start loooooong before. </strong></p><p> Or you could wind up like &ldquo;Alice&rdquo;, the four-time self-published author who approached me to help her build her book audience. She had an email list of under 50, a handful of Twitter followers and an anemic client base. She&rsquo;d never sold more than 50&mdash;not a typo&mdash;copies of any of her books. And yet she continued to devote countless hours to churning them out.</p><p> My advice to you is the same as it was to her. Start building your digital email list. Sure Twitter and Facebook are ideal distribution systems for your content, but when it comes to book sales, nothing beats a smoking hot email list.</p><p> That&rsquo;s how you reach your tribe&mdash;the people who allow you into their in-boxes and interact with you. These are the folks who will belly up to buy your book and&mdash;if you captivate them with your work&mdash;be first to spread the word.</p><p> <strong>  Because the key to outsized book sales is two-fold: you have to get about 1,000 or so of your target audience to read it&mdash;and you have to hook them. </strong>  Deep enough so they can&rsquo;t wait to share it&mdash;in-person, on-line. Think about it&mdash;how many times have you bought a half-dozen of your favorite books to share with your clients or pals?</p><p> By building your digital audience, you can get your books in the right hands yourself at a fraction of the cost of a pricey book publicist.</p><p> So isn&rsquo;t it time to start building YOUR list&mdash;your tribe? Doesn&rsquo;t your message, your big idea&mdash;DESERVE the right audience?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s make 2016 the year you go beyond your traditional audience and get your big idea&mdash;your core message&mdash;out into the world.

{"original_id":3672,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Goals Cheat Sheet for the Uninspired","link":"goals-cheat-sheet-for-the-uninspired","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Ahh, tis the season for goals. The most wonderful time of the year for growth, self-reflection, and reinvention. A New Year New You as the saying goes. Taking charge of your health, your money, and even your dress size by making changes that will improve your life for the better and last a lifetime (you hope).  </p><p> What&rsquo;s that you say? &ldquo;Bah, humbug!&rdquo;</p><p> Oh, I get it. Goals are a complete waste of time, especially for New Years. Otherwise, you would be a millionaire and in the best shape of your life. After all, you thought about your goals long and hard last year, visualizing how wonderful life would be with all that extra cash and no debt.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Why Some Goals Don't Work </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;ve tried to set goals in the past and nothing happened, right? You wanted to put aside money for retirement and max out your 401(k) contributions but you haven&rsquo;t manage to save a penny. The family vacation fund is going nowhere thanks to unforeseen roof repairs and all those holiday gifts you promised. To make matters worse, your credit card debt is getting close to the limit and you feel trapped. Depressed and defeated, you have no time, no energy, and no goals.</p><p> What if I told you that you&rsquo;re not alone and that 92% of New Year&rsquo;s goals fail by January 15? It&rsquo;s a miserable statistic but one that can be improved easily and quickly. How? Just by writing our goals down. This was scientifically proven in a research study conducted by  <a href=\"http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/study-highlights-strategies-for-achieving-goals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Gail Matthews at Dominican University (not Yale)  </u>  . </a></p><p>  Most people hold their goals in their head where they are likely to be jumbled up with the other 1500 thoughts-per-minute that the average human being experiences.  That is a big part of the reason why they fail in the first place. The other problem is that most goals are unattainable and completely unrealistic in the first place, setting us up for an emotional hijack of our self-esteem. Goals, if they are to be achieved, must be based on what one really wants out of life and on one&rsquo;s true capabilities requiring not just a pencil and a pad but a hard look in the mirror.  </p><p> The world&rsquo;s most successful people agree that what you get by achieving your goal is not as important to what you become in the process. Think about that for a minute. Falling short of achieving a goal can have a still positive effect on one&rsquo;s life. For example, you meant to save $18,000 in your 401(k) but managed to save $10,000. Does that mean goal setting was a complete waste of your time? Of course not. We need to reward ourselves for achieving some degree of measurable progress.</p><p> <strong>  Goals Cheat Sheet  </strong></p><p> Goal setting can help you become the person you want to be and achieve the things in life you most desire. Wishful thinking alone won&rsquo;t make it happen. You&rsquo;ll need a framework that will inspire you to write your goals down and then follow through with the action steps necessary for accomplishment. A great place to start is to identify one category in your life where goals setting is most needed:</p><li> Personal;</li><li> Family &amp; Relationships;</li><li> Financial;</li><li> Professional Development &amp; Career  <u>  Related See Who's The Boss - 5 Leadership Strategies Every Woman Should Know </u> ; </li><li> Health &amp; Energy. <br/>  </li><p> Then  <u>  download our complimentary our Goals Cheat Sheet Template PDF </u>  and resource guide which contains 24 pages of helpful goal tips including:</p><li> Motivational Quotes on Goals</li><li> The Ten Most Important Points about Goals</li><li> The Five Types of Goals</li><li> The Five Criteria of Goals</li><li> Goals Resources</li><li> Goals Cheat Sheet Template PDF <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Conclusion: </strong></p><p> Finally, knowing the &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind your goals, an essential but often missing element is in the goal setting process.

And the one thing that keeps coming to the surface is the importance of being &ldquo;present&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re talking to someone.You know how it is when you meet someone at a conference or in a networking situation and they&rsquo;re constantly looking around the room to see who else is there, or they&rsquo;re looking at their watch, or anywhere except at you? Those signals mean they aren&rsquo;t really &ldquo;present&rdquo; in the conversation, so there is no true connection.The same principles apply to online relationships, so I&rsquo;m a big proponent of doing what I call&hellip; Looking People in the Eye Digitally, as well as personally. Introductions and ongoing relationships in social platforms require the same personal attention as the human touch and eye contact in a physical relationship.<strong> Q: What was the inspiration for your book?</strong>The last few decades of marketing tactics have made us lazy communicators. Most often we don&rsquo;t even pay attention to who we are talking to other than via the data we collect (and even that&rsquo;s a maybe).<strong> Q: What is the key concept behind your book?</strong>2015 and 2016 need to be the years of doing what I call&hellip; Looking People in the Eye Digitally. In order to fix the problem with engagement and really start to benefit from social relationships (both as individuals and as companies), we need to start treating digital a lot more like we treat face-to-face interactions. We don&rsquo;t need to fit our world to digital, we need to fit digital to our world.I have been evangelizing and writing about Return on Relationship since early 2009, and throughout that process I have been talking a lot about how to connect, the importance of engagement, and telling everyone they should read the book <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People-ebook/dp/B003WEAI4E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447470065&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=How+to+Win+Friends+and+Influence+People&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=heicoh-20&amp;linkId=d219ccda8f040f99346b984ab01e8ce9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How to Win Friends and Influence People </a></u> by Dale Carnegie.I thought a lot about the lessons my Dad taught me early on about how to connect with people and always be sure to look them in the eye when talking to them. Next thing you know I am coining the phrase &ldquo;Look People in the Eye Digitally.&rdquo; It made sense to people and I ran with it.<strong> Q: What do you want readers to take away from your book?</strong>I want people to realize there is more to making a friend, and building a relationship, than clicking a button. Facebook has done an amazing thing &ndash; they own the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo;. The problem is that they have devalued the word while adding value to their brand. Let&rsquo;s take back the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and fill it with value again!I am a Social Marketing Strategist, Keynote Speaker, Brand Evangelist, and Acting CMO of Brand Innovators. In March 2009 I started using and evangelizing the term ROR, Return on Relationship, hashtag #RonR, and use it to educate companies, brands, and people about the importance of creating authentic connection, interaction, and engagement.Many people in the marketing, business, and blogging world know me for my enthusiastic, energetic and undeniably personal connection to people.<strong> Q: How do you describe yourself professionally?</strong>I am a Social Marketing Strategist, Keynote Speaker, Brand Evangelist, and Acting CMO of Brand Innovators.

{"original_id":3674,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Leadership Lessons from Nine-Year-Olds","link":"leadership-lessons-from-nine-year-olds","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Five years ago, I became a blogger. With 45 years of business experience as a foundation, I began sharing personal reflections and contemporary insights on leadership &ndash; fully aware that my content would not matter a damn had I not kept pace with the pulse of the new economy and the changing dynamics of customers and the workforce.</p><p> One hundred and thirty blogs later, 1 post stands out from the rest, not because it was critically acclaimed or that it generated thousands of hits. The notion of this particular post went beyond business leadership. It was lesson in life, a lesson that did not come from me, but from a Grade 4 class of 9-year olds.</p><p> I had been asked to participate as one of three judges at a speech competition at a local school. I accepted the assignment under the pretense that I would evaluate the speeches on content, presentation style, potency of opening and closing, eye contact with the audience, clarity, enthusiasm, and pacing. All true, but the element I&rsquo;d overlooked happened to be the core principle of every educational institution &ndash; the opportunity to learn.</p><p> On that day, I listened to twenty 3-minute speeches. On that day I became the student because a class of 9-year old leaders taught me several lessons in life. Here&rsquo;s how they did it:</p><h3> They Chose Insightful Topics  <br/>  </h3><p> Their content that ran the gamut from serious to hilarious. They looked to the future &ndash;  A Thousand Years from Now, Protecting the Earth, Water . One speech, entitled  I Believe  brought a tear to my eye, partly because it dealt with humanity, but also because of the sincerity in which it was delivered. I also had several good chuckles as might be expected from a boy&rsquo;s  Trip to the Dentist , and a girl&rsquo;s  What&rsquo;s so Great about Hockey ?</p><h3> Their Diverse Ethnicity Unleashed Novel Perspectives  <br/>  </h3><p> The surnames of the class typified several creeds and colors &ndash; there was a Buckles, a Clark, a Karim, a Litherland, an Okano, a Suri, a Soltan, a Wang, a Yang and a Zeng. Diversity is said to be the world&rsquo;s engine of enlightenment. In business, research proves that diversity brings unique experiences and perceptions to solving problems and creating opportunities. When properly harnessed, diversity can do the same for the country and the world.</p><h3> Their Attitudes were Refreshing and Venerable <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;d describe these 9-year old leaders as confident, enthusiastic, animated, spiritual (without religious overtones) and compassionate. With vigor they applauded every classmates&rsquo; efforts. I witnessed an expression of support that was as genuine as it was benevolent.</p><h3> They were Practiced and Prepared  <br/>  </h3><p> Their teacher had instilled a powerful ethic within them; those who prepare, succeed. So they practiced and they rehearsed over and over again, and when the time came to deliver their 3-minute discourse to three complete strangers, they excelled. This is an important lesson in life. As for a lesson in leadership, that Grade 4 teacher personified the ethic that great leaders don&rsquo;t let their followers fail.</p><p> By the conclusion of the speeches, I&rsquo;d gained new insights about Islam, places like the Big Apple and the Dominican Republic, our planet, chocolate addiction . . . and one remarkable teacher&rsquo;s passion for guiding, understanding and loving these leaders of tomorrow.

This seems fair enough, no one wants to feel forced to do something they don&rsquo;t agree with, but it can also become a problem.</p><p> We worked with two New York-based partners recently who were at odds over opening a new office on the West Coast.  Though Jake and Amy had talked about expanding to other cities at some point, Amy did not think they were ready and was not convinced that this was the right city for expansion.  Jake was going to move there for personal reasons and saw it as an opportunity to expand the business.  Amy&rsquo;s veto strained their relationship to the point that they avoided each other, employees picked sides and client service was being affected.</p><p> Though we helped them move forward, you may be able to work through something like this on your own by:</p><h3> 1. Acknowledging your underlying interests.  </h3><p> In this case Amy thought Jake was not being honest about why he wanted to open the West Coast office. By not admitting that his personal motivations were influencing him he lost credibility. Even his logical business arguments were rejected.  In negotiation this is called &ldquo;reactive devaluation&rdquo;: one party distrusts the other&rsquo;s motivations and dismisses what may be valuable suggestions simply because they are the ones offering them.</p><h3> 2. Listen as if your mind is not already made up.</h3><p> This may take some practice. In partnerships, like most close relationships, we are hard-wired to make assumptions about the other person.  Our brains want to conserve energy so when you hear familiar cues you fill in the rest without really listening.  Amy needed to confirm to Jake what he was saying, since he was frustrated that she did not seem to be hearing his ideas.</p><h3> 3. Be aware of decision fatigue.  </h3><p> Jake and Amy had just come through a difficult business period where they were constantly making critical decisions to keep their business on track.  When faced with yet another major decision Amy found it easier to say no than take on another major change.</p><p> In this case Amy and Jake worked out an agreement including timing and responsibilities for the new office that satisfied both partners.

{"original_id":3678,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Scrooge","link":"scrooge","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Ever since I was a small boy I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the classic story A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. It just never seemed like Christmas without watching one of the versions of this timeless fable.</h3><p> <br/> I recently wondered what has attracted me to this story. Was it the visit of Scrooge's past business partner Marley, the frightening ghosts, or the fate of Tiny Tim? Maybe, but I think what has held my interest is the character of Ebenezer Scrooge.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t necessarily because I wanted to take Scrooge as a role model. Oh, I suppose that, to a degree, being associated with English literature&rsquo;s most famous miser is not a bad thing for a financial planner. Only up to a point, however. I&rsquo;m pleased to have clients think of me as \"thrifty.\" I&rsquo;d prefer they didn&rsquo;t regard me as \"stingy\" or \"miserly.\"</p><p> It&rsquo;s an important distinction. \"Thrift\" is prudent, careful management of money and other resources. \"Stingy\" is a lack of generosity, with a connotation of meanness and selfishness. \"Miserly\" takes hoarding to a dysfunctional extreme, as Scrooge did. It implies a lack of conscious choice.</p><p> That lack of choice is exactly what makes Ebenezer Scrooge such a useful figure in my work with clients. The path of his transformation from this desperate place is a metaphor for helping people change the way they think about money. I&rsquo;ve used it with clients for years now, and made it the focus of a book, The Financial Wisdom of Ebenezer Scrooge, co-authored with Dr. Ted Klontz and Dr. Brad Klontz.</p><p> During his unhappy, lonely childhood, Ebenezer Scrooge developed a set of unconscious beliefs, or money scripts, that he carried into his adult life. Among those were beliefs that having more money was the way to happiness, that spending money on himself or others was wrong, that people could not be trusted, and that money was more important than people.</p><p> The quality that most people associate with Scrooge is his life as an unhappy miser and his attitude of \"Bah, humbug!\" Yet what&rsquo;s most important about A Christmas Carol is his transformation to a joyful, generous man. The visits of the Spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Future helped Scrooge understand that his beliefs about money were false. With the guidance of the Spirits, he was transformed into \". . . as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old city knew . . .\".</p><p> If Ebenezer Scrooge could change his deep-seated, painful need to hoard every penny, there is certainly hope for the rest of us to change our destructive financial patterns. We may not have magical ghosts to help us transform overnight, but we certainly have the same ability as did Scrooge to become joyful and generous of spirit.</p><p> Today's Christmas season is filled with pressures Charles Dickens could not have imagined. The marketing hype, holiday events, and expectations from families and society can be overwhelming. It's a perfect holiday recipe for overspending and other unconscious financial behavior. You might find it helpful to re-read A Christmas Carol, not simply for the story, but for some possible insight into your own money scripts. The stress of the holidays can help you begin to identify aspects of your habitual money behavior that you might want to change.</p><p> In writing A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens probably intended simply to create a sentimental story celebrating the spirit of Christmas. His talented pen, however, produced a classic piece of literature. In addition, his psychological insight created a parable that today is as useful as it is enjoyable.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 14:58:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 14:58:35.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/scrooge/\", \"post_id\": \"8125\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 14:58:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 14:58:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"scrooge\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8124\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3807\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Scrooge.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2784\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450695600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3679,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Major Time Wasters: What Managers Can Do to Enhance Employee Productivity","link":"major-time-wasters-what-managers-can-do-to-enhance-employee-productivity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Time at work can be wasted in so many different ways. While some employees end up wasting time due to boredom or job dissatisfaction, others have simply never learned how to cope effectively with their workload and obligations. In Part 1 of <a href=\"/research/human-behavior/major-time-wasters-what-employees-can-do-today-in-order-to-enhance-their-productivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Major Time Wasters  </u> </a> , we discussed some of the common ways in which employees tend to waste time at work, as well as how their unproductive behaviors eat into the company&rsquo;s bottom line. We also identified a number of  <u>  <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/part-1-major-time-wasters-what-employees-can-do-today-in-order-to-enhance-their-productivity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   strategies employees can adopt in order to help them increase their productivity  </a> </u> ; for example, getting better at prioritizing, minimizing distractions and streamlining routine tasks.While employees can take some steps to improve each day, it is also the manager&rsquo;s responsibility to coach and motivate their staff. Many employees really want to better themselves and become more efficient. Taking simple steps, such as were outlined in Part I, will eventually improve their productivity. However, the working conditions themselves can often be a hindrance to really streamlining efficiency. Because many obstacles are not in the employee&rsquo;s control, it is up to the management to help employees  <u>  remove the obstacles </u> to success and give them the tools they need.Of course, every office has its unique dynamics and environment, and every boss is different. The dynamic between boss and employee is also a factor. Many other factors, such as corporate structure and culture, and company policies, values and objectives, will have an impact on the managers&rsquo; strategies and approaches to dealing with their specific combination of people and circumstances. No matter what your work environment, let&rsquo;s look at five areas of opportunities for managers to make a time-efficient impact.</p><h3> Development of relevant guides and manuals</h3>While many bosses chafe at the idea of processes and rules, having a rulebook or set of guidelines actually helps people to become more effective. Knowing what to do, when to do it, and how to do it for some of the work activities can help avoid the time wasted in confusion and wondering who is accountable. Simple housekeeping things such as policies on attendance, lunch and coffee breaks, internet usage, and other rules of the workplace need to be written down and circulated. While most employees do not like someone looking over their shoulder, it is important to be clear about what&rsquo;s acceptable and what&rsquo;s not. The clearer things are, the less time people spend wondering and discussing.<h3> Internet monitoring</h3>The internet presents a temptation that is too hard to resist for many office workers. Social media and website browsing, online shopping, checking personal email and a number of other internet activities may seem like a much better alternative to working on a tedious assignment or a project for many employees. There are plenty of different kinds of website blocking software on the market today that a company could easily obtain and install on the office computers. Various types of internet activity-monitoring software and website tracking tools are also available for purchase and quick download.Of course employees now have smartphones, tablets and other personal digital devices, and can find their way around these sophisticated internet monitoring programs. However, they will be less likely to waste time browsing the internet, if they are aware of the fact that their company is taking the issue seriously enough to go into such lengths. Additionally, introducing strict penalties for violation of the internet usage policies can discourage even those repeat offenders who are tech-savvy enough to outsmart the internet monitoring software.<h3> Meeting optimization</h3><u> <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/curing-a-workplace-of-meeting-mania-preempting-further-productivity-loss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Unnecessary or poorly organized meeting </a> s</u>are nothing but a waste of time. American employees spend too much time in preparation for and attendance of various meetings, time that could otherwise be used for more productive purposes. Various studies suggest that the cost of work foregone and productivity lost is in the millions of dollars per year.Eliminating all unnecessary meetings is paramount to recovering employee productivity. Any meeting that has no real goal or clear agenda should not be held, period. Any such meeting is a waste of everyone&rsquo;s time, as it bring more confusion than clarity and usually heralds more of these redundant meetings to come. Meetings that do have a clear purpose should be limited to a certain number of attendees, have a facilitator, begin and end at the agreed-upon time, and perhaps most importantly have a clear follow-up plan of action that everyone understands and agrees to and which is circulated.<h3> Offering challenges and reward</h3>Employee boredom, lack of genuine enthusiasm and having a negative attitude towards the work or the workplace will naturally lead to many time-wasting behaviors and habits. Managers need to understand what motivates employees and offer them relevant challenges and rewards in order to incite employees to become more invested in their work. <u> <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/you-are-only-as-strong-as-your-weakest-link-motivation-a-driving-force-behind-employee-productivity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Motivating employees is the least costly thing managers can do to boost their morale and productivity </a></u>. Challenging workers doesn&rsquo;t equate to increasing their workload, though; any challenge, big or small, will do the job, as long as it can provide a positive stimulus to employee engagement with the company and their work. Tangible rewards such as bonuses, or gifts or intangibles such as Employee of the Month awards, are usually welcomed. However if the overall culture is negative, or the work is unclear or the team is dysfunctional, these things alone won&rsquo;t help with efficiency. Creating a work environment where employees do what they are best at, where they thrive and can excel, is the fastest way to get people to make good choices about what they do with their time.<h3> Leading by example</h3>In order to inspire employees to become more invested in their work, managers need to be the role models and set positive examples. Employees watch their management for cues and clues on what&rsquo;s acceptable and what&rsquo;s not. For example, if a company manager comes to work on time, maintains an upbeat and friendly attitude, doesn&rsquo;t browse social media sites during office hours, all while staying organized and doing his/her job well, it will create a good example for his/her subordinates to follow. This manager is more likely to succeed in changing employee behavior than the one who doesn&rsquo;t hold him/herself to the same standards as the rest of the office.","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 15:11:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 15:11:32.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/major-time-wasters-what-managers-can-do-to-enhance-employee-productivity/\", \"post_id\": \"8127\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 15:11:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 15:11:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"major-time-wasters-what-managers-can-do-to-enhance-employee-productivity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8126\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3808\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/time-wasters.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"680\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450706400,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

A lot of effort is spent trying to figure out how to save a few percent in costs, or lift sales by a modest amount, and so on.  This type of approach isn&rsquo;t planning for a performance lift&hellip;it is only planning for an adjustment to the margins of the business.</p><p> There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with wanting to keep things moving along as they have been and trying to improve the business margin.  Same efforts&hellip;same inputs&hellip;.the certainty of a systematic approach that produces consistent results&hellip;but with slightly improved profitability.  That&rsquo;s a good thing, and is certainly a &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; approach to running the practice.</p><p> But is it fulfilling professionally?</p><h3> Does it really lift your game and lead to breakthrough business results?</h3><p> <br/> To really lift performance &ndash; and I am talking quantum leap here, not a good incremental increase &ndash; you need to pin down your purpose.  It is that place where what you love doing intersects with what your are fabulous at, and which the market needs and will happily pay for.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_0912.jpg?w=610&amp;h=533\"/></p><h3> HAPPILY pay for.</h3><p> <br/> The market will happily pay for it because what you do creates immensely valuable differences in their world&hellip;.you are fixing problems that baffle them perhaps.  Or you are creating emotional security and peace of mind.  Maybe you are delivering innovative thinking that excites them and encourages them and challenges your clients to live a very different life to what they thought possible.</p><p> People will pay handsomely for the emotional outcomes&hellip;.the feelings that can be achieved from the results of great professional planning and advice. That is what they value.  They don&rsquo;t tend to significantly value products, or managed funds, or a new tax break.  Obviously those things have a value, but it is transitory. It is forgotten about in no time.</p><h3> Real value in clients minds lies in the life changes that a professional created for them.  The products and tactics used were simply tools, or steps along the way. They don&rsquo;t matter in the end.</h3><p> <br/> For many practitioners focussing on the tools and the tactics is easy, and there are nearly always new efficiencies and business opportunities in these areas that can lead to healthier margins for the practice year-on-year.  They don&rsquo;t lead to quantum leaps in business performance, or in satisfaction levels for the aspirational professional.</p><p> Finding your purpose and focussing on that does lead to quantum leaps in performance and satisfaction levels.</p><p> It took me a long time to learn that, and arguably I only figured it out about 5 years ago.  But geez the last 5 years have been different to all others in my career beforehand.  I work pretty much every day of the year (for at least a few hours!) these days&hellip;because I want to.  I only charge fees for time and expertise&hellip;.there&rsquo;s no commissions in my world.  And people pay&hellip;.and ask for me to come back and do more work.  And I don&rsquo;t have contracts that people sign&hellip;.I pretty much work on a handshake or a head nod and tell people &ldquo;if you aren&rsquo;t happy, don&rsquo;t pay&ldquo;.</p><h3> But people do pay.</h3><p> <br/> Why?</p><p> 2 simple reasons that are purpose-driven:</p><li> Because they need it, and I&rsquo;m great at it.</li><li> Because what we really achieve together is a different life for them. <br/>  </li><h3> How is that so different to what any professional adviser aims to do with, and for, clients?</h3><p> <br/> It seems to me that is exactly what professional advisers aim to achieve for all clients: to get them a different life.  The life they crave, but don&rsquo;t know how to achieve by themselves.</p><p> All of the angst in industry about whether consumers will pay fees or not arises because advisers are often trying to sell the wrong thing. Consumers won&rsquo;t pay fees for products generally. They will pay fees for a better life.</p><p> All of the angst in the industry about whether we are a profession or not arises because we too many people are selling the wrong stuff. Professions don&rsquo;t sell products. Professions provide solutions that change lives.</p><p> Figuring out how to solve all of the angst in the industry does not, and will not, lead to greater business performance for most practices.  Real value lies in figuring out your purpose and valuing it accordingly, and then telling your story to the market.</p><p> That&rsquo;s a game changer because it leads to a quantum leap forward.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 15:14:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 15:14:01.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/knowing-your-professional-purpose-is-your-game-changer/\", \"post_id\": \"8129\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 15:14:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 15:14:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"knowing-your-professional-purpose-is-your-game-changer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8128\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3809\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/game-changing-results.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"530\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450693800,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3681,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Why You Should Be Using Twitter to Market Your Business in 2016","link":"5-reasons-why-you-should-be-using-twitter-to-market-your-business-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSocialQuant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sheena White  </u> </a> | <u>  Social Quant </u></p><p> If you know me at all, you know that I love Twitter. </p><h3> Of all the social media platforms, it drives most of the traffic to my site.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s also been huge in building my list.</p><p> Oh, and most recently it helped me to secure a spot as a writer on a business site that will only add to my credibility and increase my exposure.</p><p> But if you AREN&rsquo;T a huge fan of Twitter, if you just don&rsquo;t get it or you just aren&rsquo;t using it, I&rsquo;m going to give you five reasons I think you should be using Twitter to market your business in 2016.</p><h3> 1. Because Periscope is a big deal.</h3><p> Okay, so that may be vague, but I couldn&rsquo;t think of another way to phrase it.</p><p> Live broadcasting has been huge in 2015 with the release of Meerkat, followed by Periscope and then later Blab. Live broadcasting is going to continue to grow in 2016 and I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say that Periscope will prevail over Meerkat.</p><p> Because Periscope is owned by Twitter and all of your Scopes are tweeted out every time you hit Broadcast, building an active, engaged audience on Twitter is only going to help you get more people on your Scopes&hellip;which in turn will mean more engagement and (ideally) more sales.</p><h3> 2. Because it&rsquo;s a great traffic driver.</h3><p> I touched on this in the beginning, but it&rsquo;s true:  <u>  Twitter is great when it comes to driving traffic </u>  because Twitter users go there with the intention of finding content.</p><p> They want tips, the latest news updates and other information. They don&rsquo;t go there to look at pictures of their friends&rsquo; dogs. &lt;wink&gt;</p><p> Also, unlike Facebook, there are no algorithms to prevent your content from getting out into the newsfeed. It&rsquo;s just a matter of being ACTIVE and providing VALUE.</p><h3> 3. Because you can remarket to Twitter audiences just like you can Facebook audiences.</h3><p> People love Facebook because of its ability to let you target your website visitors&hellip;but Twitter can do the same thing!</p><p> Once visitors land on your website, you can use the Twitter code on your site to  <u>  tag visitors and remarket to those people </u> &hellip;turning cold traffic into warm traffic, and eventually to buyers!</p><h3> 4. Because it&rsquo;s the most widely used social network for customer service.</h3><p> When you need to address a problem with a company, which platform would you more likely turn to: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter&hellip;? I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb once again and say you go to Twitter first. Everyone does!</p><p> And in 2015 Twitter made it even easier to provide customer service.</p><p> First, in April they gave users the ability to receive private messages (DMs) from people they don&rsquo;t follow. Before, users had to follow each other in order to receive DMs. This means that even if a company isn&rsquo;t following a particular user, the business can still receive a DM from them.</p><p> Twitter made another second valuable update in August  when they removed the 140-character limit for DMs, which meant anyone who wanted to communicate directly with a company didn&rsquo;t have to limit the conversation to 140 characters or send multiple short messages in order to convey the point (both equally frustrating).</p><p> Together, these updates make it easier than ever before for consumers to directly interact with businesses for customer service issues&hellip;or regarding any other questions they may have about products and services.</p><h3> 5. Because it&rsquo;s an amazing research tool.</h3><p> Twitter is a great tool if you want to do research on your target market and find out what they are interested in. You can now even conduct simple polls to elicit a fast response from your audience. Click here to learn some creative ideas for using polls.</p><p> Because of the direct access that Twitter gives you to your audience, you can stop guessing what they want and learn from what they are saying online about your products and services as well as your competitors&rsquo;.</p><p> Cruise tweet chats and find out what questions Twitter users are asking to generate blog ideas or Periscope broadcast topics. Do  <u>  advanced searches on Twitter </u>  for questions that they&rsquo;re asking using specific keywords or hashtags.</p><p> The list goes on and on.</p><p> But the bottom line is that it&rsquo;s a great research tool that you can and should be using. The sooner the better!</p><p> So have I convinced you? Will you be using  <u>  Twitter to market your business </u>  in 2016?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 15:33:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 15:33:31.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-reasons-why-you-should-be-using-twitter-to-market-your-business-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8131\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 15:33:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 15:33:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-reasons-why-you-should-be-using-twitter-to-market-your-business-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8130\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3810\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-reasons-to-use-twitter-in-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"639\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450700100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3682,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Fintech Banks Will Rule The World","link":"why-fintech-banks-will-rule-the-world","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whilst debating whether new fintech startups would eat the banker's lunch yesterday, I stumbled across a really interesting read by Philippe Gelis, co-founder and CEO of FX firm Kantox.  It was so good that I asked Philippe if I could put it on the blog and he kindly agreed.  Read and enjoy ...</p><h3> Why Fintech Banks Will Rule The World, by Philippe Gelis</h3><p> <br/> Last week, I had the opportunity to present Kantox and my vision of Fintech in front of around 150 bank executives from Northern Europe. After my pitch, we had a Q&amp;A round, and one more time I had proof that bankers are not expecting at all what will happen in the next 10 years.</p><p> The financial industry is one of the last large industries that have not been already really disrupted. Nevertheless, it seems that bankers do not have much of a different approach to the people who ran the press, hospitality and airline industries some years ago.</p><p> Every industry will be &ldquo;uberized&rdquo;, but it seems that most bankers still think it will be different in their case, probably because they consider that the heavy regulation will protect them and limit the growth of Fintech at some point. Bankers simply do not understand that tech companies are agile enough to take advantage of any piece of regulation.</p><p> They also still believe that customers still trust banks, while since the 2008 financial crisis and due to the never-ending financial scandals (Libor-gate, the FX fixing scandal, etc.) customers (both individuals and businesses) have a huge appetite for alternative finance. Banks are not seen any more as partners, but rather as pure providers only looking after their own interests and short-term profits.</p><p> It is a first step for banks to open incubators or to create VC funds to invest in start-ups, some of them Fintech, but it is definitely not enough. Most banks look to fund fintech start-ups that create products to be added on top of banks products, that will make the user experience better, but they almost never invest in products that directly compete with them, that cannibalize them.</p><h3> Let me explain why I think bankers are completely wrong.</h3><p> <br/> We are now experimenting with the first wave of fintech, which sees companies competing with banks on specific products:</p><li> Loans and credit</li><li> Payments</li><li> Foreign exchange and remittance</li><li> Wealth management</li><li> and many more <br/>  </li><p> Lending Club is far and away the global flagship fintech company. The success of its IPO has been a game changer for the entire fintech sector.</p><p> So, banks are getting pressured by newcomers but &ndash;and the &ldquo;but&rdquo; is really important&ndash; these disrupters are relying on old-school banks for banking services and banking infrastructure (bank accounts, payments, compliance, brokerage, etc.). In other words, they are re-inventing the user experience, the user interface or the business model but not &ldquo;the whole thing&rdquo; (to steal a quote from Marc Andreessen). And by relying on banks to do business, fintech companies are clients and so generate revenue for the bank. Let&rsquo;s say it is a co-petition (co-operative competition) model in which fintech stays at the mercy of banks, they disrupt banks on one side but they bring them business on the other side. In the end, banks still win.</p><p> It is important to note that many fintech businesses have evolved from pure &ldquo;P2P models&rdquo; to &ldquo;marketplace models&rdquo; where the liquidity can come from peers or from financial institutions.</p><p> Lending Club is known for getting up to 80% of its liquidity from financial institutions and not from peers. Here we have a clear example of banks considering it to be more efficient and therefore more profitable for them to lend money through Lending Club than through their outdated branches. Anyway, the challenge is more in having deep liquidity than in locating the liquidity.</p><p> <strong>  The second wave of fintech, to come in two to five years&rsquo; time, will be &ldquo;marketplace banking&rdquo; (or &ldquo;fintech banks&rdquo;). This will be a type of bank based on five simple elements: </strong></p><li> A core banking platform built from scratch.</li><li> An API layer to connect to third parties.</li><li> A compliance/KYC infrastructure and processes.</li><li> A banking license, to be independent from other banks and the ability to hold client funds without restrictions.</li><li> A customer base/CRM, meaning that the fintech bank will have the customers, and a customer support team. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The products directly offered by the fintech bank will be limited to &ldquo;funds holding&rdquo;, comprised of: </strong></p><li> Bank accounts (multi-currency).</li><li> Credit and debit cards (multi-currency).</li><li> eWallet (multi-currency). <br/>  </li><p> All other services (investing, trading &amp; brokerage; wealth management; loans, credit &amp; mortgages; crowdfunding (equity and social); insurance; crypto-currencies; payments; remittances &amp; FX; this list is not exhaustive) will be provided by third parties through the API, including old-school banks, financial institutions and fintech companies.</p><br /><p> Imagine that you are a client of this &ldquo;marketplace bank&rdquo; and that you need a loan. You do not really care if the loan is provided to you by Lending Club or Bank of America, what you look for is a quick and frictionless process to get your loan, and the lowest interest rate possible.</p><p> So, through the API, the &ldquo;marketplace bank&rdquo; will consult all its third parties and offer you the loan that best suits you.</p><p> We can imagine both a process in which conditions offered by third parties are non-negotiable but we can also imagine a competitive bidding process to get the best offer for each client at any point in time.</p><p> I have been asked several times about this business model and I think it is a no-brainer. It is a simple mix between an access fee to the &ldquo;marketplace bank&rdquo; and a revenue sharing model with the third parties providing additional services.</p><p> Here we have a completely different approach regarding the relationship with incumbents. Fintech banks, thanks to their banking licence, will not rely any more on any bank to be and stay in business, and so will not be at the mercy of incumbents. What is even more powerful, through the marketplace, incumbents will become &ldquo;clients&rdquo; of fintech banks, so the system will be completely reversed.</p><p> We will see banks pay a commission to Fintech banks to serve their customers!</p><p> The beauty of &ldquo;marketplace banking&rdquo; is that it competes directly with banks on core banking services without the need to build all the products.</p><h3> Now the question is, what is really needed to launch a &ldquo;marketplace bank&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> Technology/API/Compliance/KYC: building the technology is a complex part but many people have the skills to do so. So it is definitely not the main barrier.</p><p> Banking license: in Europe, the budget to get a banking license is estimated at approximately &euro;20 million, though it could cost less or more, depending on the country. But it is not only about money.</p><p> To be in business you need strong and experienced board members, without them regulators will probably not give you the green light. So this means that you need to be able to convince investors and board members to trust you based on a Powerpoint presentation and to bet big on you. I think that we need the first wave of fintech to be successful, with some exits and big returns, to have people betting a lot of money on &ldquo;marketplace banking&rdquo;.</p><p> As an entrepreneur you need to have demonstrated that you are able to execute and scale a fintech business to lead that kind of new venture.</p><p> Customer base/CRM: here is the most complex part. How do you attract a critical mass of customers based on a simple offering (accounts + cards + eWallet) that relies on third parties for additional services? You cannot only rely on marketing and having a cool brand to attract hundreds of thousands of new customers if you have nothing really different to offer.</p><p> You also need some kind of focus: will you target individuals or businesses? Lower end or high net worth individuals? Small, medium or large businesses? Will you focus on one single country or several ones?</p><p> As always, it is all about customers and revenues, so you need a clear sales and marketing plan to quickly scale the customer base. I have some ideas how to do it but I will keep it for another post.</p><p> I have been asked several times if the first &ldquo;marketplace bank&rdquo; will be launched by an old-school bank (an incumbent) or a fintech startup? I definitely think the latter. It is too disruptive and the risk of cannibalization is too high to see a bank assuming the risk.</p><p> Anyway, most bankers are not already worried enough by fintech to react to its coming second wave. I remember a pool during a fintech panel where almost 90% of people answered that a fintech bank was improbable and, if it happens, it would be build by an incumbent.

{"original_id":3683,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Surfing Taught Me to Design","link":"how-surfing-taught-me-to-design","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> My relationship with the ocean began before I was born.</h3><p> <br/> My parents rented a small boat the weekend Jaws was released. Ironically, the movie was filmed in Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, where my father chose to introduce my mother to the sport of sailing. I have been told it did not go well. Over the years, my parents found common ground on the topic and discovered they were happiest when sailing.</p><h3> I was born into a family of sailors.</h3><p> <br/> Sailing as a kid can be immeasurably exciting, witnessing massive submarines alongside your modest boat, sharks baring their teeth as they investigate your floating refuge. But sailing can also include dull, languid, and seemingly endless trips through thick fog in rolling seas where the most interesting thing in sight is the bow of your vessel.  </p><h3> The ocean is a deeply contemplative world that requires participation.</h3><p> <br/> Thoughts turn inward and you develop the ability to dream and imagine &ndash; just to entertain yourself while the environment demands concentration and awareness.</p><p> When I was old enough, my brothers all chipped in and bought me a windsurfer. Just a few days later, I was in the water and beginning a trial-and-error process that continues to this day. I quickly learned that surfing is as much mental as it is physical. It requires thinking about motion, balance, position, and timing. I&rsquo;ve been frustrated to tears and elated with satisfaction within minutes.</p><p> Somewhere during my years of practice and failure on the ocean, I began my career as a designer. I learned how the economic use of materials on hand could solve problems if applied in the right way. I watched my mentors and reflected on how they solved problems and how they thought about their disciplines. I learned that time spent examining the problem was more helpful in the long run than time spent creating the solution. I saw that the best individuals spent the most time preparing, understanding and positioning their abilities so that when the right challenge was presented they were there to solve it. It was the philosophy of surfing made real.</p><p> Over the last 15 months, my partners and I have shaped a new kind of design firm focused on solving a new set of design challenges. We use design thinking and technology to reduce the complexity of our technical world to home in on the basics. Our approach is reductive, removing all but the necessary elements; it often reminds me of the lessons I learned while surfing.</p><p> Here are the lessons we&rsquo;ve found most impactful:</p><li> <strong>  Tune out. Practice the art of disconnecting. </strong> There is nothing more distracting than the constant flow of requests, reminders, and obligations. Turn everything off and use the absence of digital noise to reconnect with friends and family and be present. <br/>  </li><p> The ocean is my place to reflect, and over the years, I&rsquo;ve become more aware of the behaviors that make surfing so important to my ability to be creative. But inspiration comes from wherever you allow it to. Designers need places to reflect and allow their own thoughts to surface.</p><li> <strong>  Drop in. </strong> When it&rsquo;s time to work, work harder than you think you can. Pick the work that inspires you and exhaust yourself learning how to do it. Don&rsquo;t let big waves get in your way. Respect the fact that you will get knocked down and beat up. Practice until you&rsquo;ve eliminated every possible way to fail. All that&rsquo;s left is the way to succeed. Embrace that moment and use it as a point of departure for your next project, your next wave.</li><li> <strong>  Pick your wave. </strong> If you know what inspires you, do more of it. You&rsquo;re never going to learn how to surf in a safe harbor. In design, new skills mean new languages, new ideas, and new disciplines. There is always more to learn.</li><li> <strong>  Get back up. Learn to fall. </strong> Failing isn&rsquo;t what you should fear; staying still is. Staying still means missing opportunities. In surfing, when you fall you have the chance to learn all that led you to that moment, and the joy of getting back up. Talent and genius are impressive but fleeting. I have met so many talented designers who can&rsquo;t get back up if knocked down. Perseverance is the universal quality of successful designers.</li><li> <strong>  Have fun. </strong> Do you know how to spot the best surfer at a beach? She&rsquo;s the one smiling the most and laughing the most. Above all else, have fun. <br/>  </li><h3> No two design challenges are the same.</h3><p> <br/> No two waves are the same. But the approach to both design and the wave &mdash; deeply examining the problem and reducing it to its basics &mdash;should be the same.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 16:06:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 16:06:29.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-surfing-taught-me-to-design/\", \"post_id\": \"8135\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 16:06:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 16:06:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-surfing-taught-me-to-design\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8134\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3812\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-Surfing-Taught-Me-to-Design.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"735\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450728000,"author_id":436,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3684,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Trends: The Future of Sales Through 2020","link":"five-trends-the-future-of-sales-through-2020","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awesomelysimple\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Spence  </u> </a> | via <a href=\"http://www.kitedesk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kite Desk  </u> </a></p><p> As I look at the future of sales, let&rsquo;s say over the next five years, there are a few major trends that I predict will impact our profession.</p><h3> #1: Competence is critical.</h3><p> <br/> As products become more and more similar, one of the ways to keep out of the commodity trap is for the salesperson to add real and significant value by being exceedingly professional, prepared, and competent. It is not enough just to know about your products and services, you must be an expert on your products and services, your industry, your competition, your customer, and their business. Customers are more knowledgeable than ever and one of the quickest ways to lose trust (and a sale) is for the customer to know more than you do.</p><p> <strong>  The salesperson of the future is going to have to be committed to lifelong learning on sales skills, product knowledge, business acumen, industry awareness and all of the key factors that their customers are concerned about. </strong></p><h3> #2: Keep up with technology.</h3><p> <br/> The velocity of change across every business is only going to increase in the next 10 years. That means you have to keep up with the technologies that change your business, the technologies that change your customers&rsquo; business. and the technologies that will impact how you perform your job as a salesperson.</p><p> I can absolutely guarantee you that five years from now things will be dramatically different from a technology standpoint and you need to be riding the front of that wave, not letting it crash down on you.</p><p> As an example, many of the top innovation thought leaders have outlined a major areas where there will be massive change in the next 5 to 10 years, they are: computer deep learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet of things, augmented reality, virtual reality, synthetic medicine, and genetic decoding and re-coding.</p><p> <strong>  I challenge you to take a few minutes and think about how significant change in these areas might drive significant change &mdash; even a complete realignment &mdash; in your business or in the customers that you serve. </strong></p><h3> #3: Social media is the future of referrals.</h3><p> <br/> I would not say this was the future of sales, but I can say with great confidence that over the next several years social proof via social media will continue to grow as the major driver of referrals. There is absolutely no stronger marketing then when a satisfied customer tells 100, 1,000 or 100,000 people about how amazing your products and services are. So building strong relationships with highly satisfied customers, who become customer evangelists and tell everyone on their social media platforms that you totally rock, will be the most powerful way to increase your sales success. On the other hand, you must also remember that if you mess something up terribly, you can just as easily create a customer terrorist who goes out to their entire network in an effort to shut you down.</p><p> <strong>  Reputation, both on-line and off-line has never been more important or fragile. </strong></p><h3> #4: You can&rsquo;t sell just your product.</h3><p> <br/> I believe it will be critical for the salesperson of the future not just to sell their products and services, but have a command of the full array of solutions that can solve a broad set of problems for their customer, even when it means bringing in other vendors who have unique expertise and possibly even partnering with the competition. If you can be the type of salesperson who is basically a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for your customers, giving them the answers and solutions they need no matter where they come from, you will be a valuable member of their team. As an example, many of my clients call me with problems that have nothing to do with my immediate area of expertise, but they know because I have such a broad global network of business experts I can likely find the answer from them from someone else and trust that I would only recommend someone who will deliver excellence.</p><p> <strong>  Be a valued resource. </strong></p><h3> #5: Some things will never change.</h3><p> <br/> Even though I&rsquo;ve just outlined some major changes that will inform your future as a salesperson, you also have to understand that there are a handful of things that must never change. These are core elements of being a true sales professional &mdash; honesty, integrity, responsiveness, trust, superb communication skills, and always acting in the best interest of the customer. A lot of people say that in order to stay successful in the future you will have to &ldquo;think outside the box.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  I recommend you first figure out the things that must absolutely stay in the box, such as the items I&rsquo;ve listed above, and then be willing, even eager to change anything else that might need to change. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 16:19:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 16:19:47.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-trends-the-future-of-sales-through-2020/\", \"post_id\": \"8137\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 16:19:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 16:19:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-trends-the-future-of-sales-through-2020\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8136\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3813\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-Future-of-Sales-Through-2020.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"508\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450688400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3685,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Steps to Get Magical Results From Integrating PR and Paid Media","link":"three-steps-to-get-magical-results-from-integrating-pr-and-paid-media","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  Natasha Drilon </u></p><p> We all know that while public relations (PR) is still one of the most effective tools in the financial services marketer&rsquo;s kit, best practice calls for an integrated approach that will amplify your company&rsquo;s PR and drive leads. And you don&rsquo;t need a magic wand to get great results.</p><p> Instead, try an integrated PR/marketing approach that uses earned, paid and owned media tactics to promote your content. <strong>  Here are some quick tips on how to get started. </strong></p><h3> 1. Use analytics and paid media to drive traffic to your earned media coverage</h3><p> <br/> If you have some stellar media coverage you want to share further, use paid tools to amplify your coverage across multiple channels to increase the reach.</p><p> An example of this tactic in action is the company selling low-end consumer goods online which placed one article on Buzzfeed. Tracking showed this one article drove $30k worth of traffic to their website, a huge deal for this relatively small outlet &ndash; especially given the low spend.</p><p> The company tracked the source of this traffic using Google Analytics &ndash; which showed exactly how many of the people who read the article went on to buy the product.</p><p> The company got further mileage from the article by running a paid media campaign using AdWords, which kept the article in circulation, reinforcing the return on the earned media and earning them another $22k in revenue.</p><p> The moral of this story is: track with analytics and amplify with paid media.</p><h3> 2. Remember the call to action</h3><p> <br/> Ideally, all of our earned online media coverage would include links back to our company websites or products, but when you are not in complete control of the content this can be difficult to achieve.</p><p> The good news is that even if you have a great online media article without a link back to your content there are other ways of attracting visitors to your website. One free tool that helps you do this is  <a href=\"http://snip.ly/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Snip.ly </a> , which essentially enables you to clone the webpage that contains the media article in a way that can bring them back to your website. It does this by adding a pop-up box to the article, which links back to your company page or prompts readers to give you their email address.</p><h3> 3. Promote the article on social media</h3><p> <br/> Whatever you do with your earned and owned media content, it should always be aligned with your social media content. Your social media content should also reflect your overall branding. Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter are great tools for amplifying your key messages and maintaining engagement.</p><p> Each platform also has paid components which can boost your content even further. Here are some examples:</p><li> <strong>  Targeted Facebook ads </strong> &ndash; Facebook enables you to target both sponsored posts and conventional ads according to a wide variety of criteria. For financial services content promotion, you might want to target people that work as financial planners, or employees of financial services companies</li><li> <strong>  Promoted tweets </strong>  &ndash; Twitter now enables you to promote individual tweets, which can be a great way to get in front of the right people and join the social conversation. You can target users by interest, gender, geographic, or device &ndash; so you can get in front of the right people at the right time</li><li> <strong>  Outbrain </strong>  &ndash; is another content promotion ad network that enables you to cost effectively attract traffic that&rsquo;s likely to be interested in your product or service based on the other material they&rsquo;re reading, sharing or liking <br/>  </li><h3> How it can work for you too</h3><p> <br/> Last year, BlueChip worked with the  <u>  <a href=\"http://fpa.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial Planning Association  </a> </u>  (FPA), to develop and execute an integrated PR/marketing campaign promoting Financial Planning Week.</p><p> The aim of the campaign was to promote the value of financial advice among the general public.</p><p> <strong>  Our approach included: </strong></p><li> Take 60% of the 2013 advertising spend and achieve better ROI in 2014</li><li> Do this by driving traffic and readership of the campaign content, which included The  <u>  <a href=\"http://ask.fpa.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ask an Expert forum  </a> </u> , The  <u>  <a href=\"http://fpa.com.au/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FPA Consumer Blog  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://fpa.com.au/find-a-planner/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Find a Planner directory  </a> </u>  &ndash; and targeting four specific demographics</li><li> Assess best fit digital and traditional tools, mindful of budget</li><li> Create an integrated campaign, leveraging content and digital assets across a number of channels</li><li> Drive value and niche content to the selected demographics via earned, owned and paid (Outbrain &amp; Facebook) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Results: </strong></p><li> 1056% increase in hits to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://fpa.com.au/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FPA Consumer Blog  </a> </u>  (compared to 2013)</li><li> 127.5% increase in hits to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://ask.fpa.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ask an Expert forum  </a> </u>  (compared to 2013)</li><li> Over 90% of Ask an Expert users were new visitors to the site, average page visits were 3-4 and average time on site was 3:16 mins <br/>  </li><p> So the message is: get your integrated hats on now! It&rsquo;s a simple strategy that can deliver results for your company way beyond traditional PR. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 16:41:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 16:41:31.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-steps-to-get-magical-results-from-integrating-pr-and-paid-media/\", \"post_id\": \"8139\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 16:41:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 16:41:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-steps-to-get-magical-results-from-integrating-pr-and-paid-media\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8138\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3814\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Magical-Results-From-Integrating-PR-and-Paid-Media.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"386\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450720800,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

In 1972, eight years after her joining the legislature, her fellow lawmakers voted her in as president pro tempore of the state senate, becoming the first African American woman to hold this post. Persistence gave us a woman who was willing to be ostracized in order to do what was right. She set an example for all women.</p><h3> Meryl Streep</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Integrate what you believe in every single area of your life. Take your heart to work and ask the most and best of everybody else, too.&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/merylstree121223.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meryl Streep  </a> </u></p><p> In 1975, Dino De Laurentis, producer of the upcoming movie King Kong, sat waiting to watch auditions for the female lead. Meryl Streep, then a little known actress, walked in. The director said to his son in Italian, &ldquo;Why did you bring me this ugly thing?&rdquo; Streep knew Italian and was taken aback. She walked out mumbling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m what you got.&rdquo; Looking back, Meryl wrote, &ldquo;This was a pivotal moment for me. This one rogue opinion could have derailed my dreams of becoming an actress.&rdquo;</p><p> It didn&rsquo;t. Streep kept going and is now the most successful actress in America. Persistence gave us many wonderful experiences in the world of movies including The Deer Hunter, Kramer vs. Kramer and The Devil Wore Prada.</p><h3> Sheryl Sandberg</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Leadership is not bullying and leadership is not aggression. Leadership is the expectation that you can use your voice for good. That you can make the world a better place.&rdquo; Sheryl Sandberg</p><p> As Chief Operating Office of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg has made a career of persistently leading companies and standing up for women&rsquo;s rights in the workplace. Some might look at her life and say she is not in touch with the regular woman.</p><p> However, in a Forbes article critiquing Sandberg&rsquo;s book Lean in, Susan Adams writes: &ldquo;In the book&rsquo;s opening anecdote, Sandberg describes what a tough time she had while pregnant with her first child. She gained 70 pounds, her feet swelled two shoe sizes and she vomited every day for nine months. I read this and I thought immediately, she gets it.&rdquo;</p><p> Sandberg became the first woman to serve on Facebook&rsquo;s board in 2012. In the same year she was named one of the most 100 influential people in the world according to Time magazine. Her humility is a part of her determination to fight for other women. &ldquo;We stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us, women who had to fight for the rights that we now take for granted,&rdquo; she writes. Persistence gave us a business woman who leads by example and is making strides for other women in business.</p><p> If you are a woman in business, be persistent. Women before you have faced obstacles in the workplace and kept going. Do the same and influence the women who will follow you.</p>If you are a woman in business, be persistent.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 16:57:43.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 16:57:43.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/persistence-a-vital-quality-for-these-four-great-women-leaders/\", \"post_id\": \"8141\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 16:57:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 16:57:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"persistence-a-vital-quality-for-these-four-great-women-leaders\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8140\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3815\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Persistence\\u2014A-Vital-Quality-for-These-Four-Great-Women-Leaders.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"686\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450710000,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

Here are three tips to get you started on the path toward solid financial planning for your future.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  My top recommendations include: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Take charge:  </strong> Remember, it&rsquo;s your money. You are in complete control of the engagement with your financial planner. You need to feel heard and understood, as opposed to being lectured to or talked down to.</li><li> <strong>  Look at the big picture: </strong>  Financial planning is more than just retirement planning or tax planning, so it&rsquo;s important to keep both your long- and short-term goals in mind when developing a strategy.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t confuse financial planning with investing:  </strong> There is a difference, and you need to distinguish between them. The financial planning process helps you understand the impact that one decision may have on other areas of your financial life.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t expect unrealistic returns on investments: </strong>  The market fluctuates daily, so take a long-term view, especially with your retirement funds. It is not uncommon for clients to adopt a 30-year time horizon for retirement.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t wait until a money crisis to begin financial planning: </strong> It is never too early to plan, nor is it ever too late to start planning. You may not be able to control stock market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, or the value of your home, but you can still be in control of your future. Planning provides direction and guidance, which can ultimately increase your financial confidence. <br/>  </li><p> To assist you further, here are three tips on how to pick a financial planner.</p><h3> 1. Do your homework.</h3><p> <br/> Remember, it&rsquo;s your money&mdash;and you are responsible for making sure that anyone who is managing it will do the best of their ability. Because the past few years have shown us that not all financial managers are trustworthy, it&rsquo;s important to spend time with several planners to learn which one you are most comfortable working with.</p><li> <strong>  Interview the candidates several times. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ask for references&mdash;and check them </strong> (see details in #2 below).</li><li> <strong>  And most importantly, remember that you are the boss in this relationship. </strong> Technical skills and competence are the starting point. Your advisor must understand your time horizon, your goals, your capacity for risk&mdash;and most importantly, you as an individual, not just an investor. <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Be diligent about checking references.</h3><p> <br/> I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough. Here are some useful sites for your research:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Finra.org  </a> </u>  is the Financial Industry&rsquo;s Regulatory Agency where you can obtain records on stockbrokers, investment advisors, and insurance agents and their firms. Finra offers information on the states and regulatory organizations they are registered with, as well as the licenses they hold, and the exams they have taken/passed.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://adviserinfo.sec.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   Adviserinfo.sec.gov  </a> </u>  has information about clients, fees, and business and disciplinary records for investment advisors regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These are firms that manage more than $25 million. Click on &ldquo;Investment Advisor Search&rdquo; in the left column to see the FormADV.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fpanet.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.fpanet.org  </a> </u>  is the official site of the Financial Planning Association, which lists information about advisors&rsquo; education and area-of-practice focus. <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Find a financial planner in your area. </h3><p> <br/> Be sure to inquire about how the advisor makes decisions, assesses their performance, and processes decisions. Listen for responses that seem too impressive or evasive.</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cfp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.  </a> </u> <br/> 800-487-1497</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fpanet.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial Planning Association  </a> </u> <br/> 800-322-4237</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.napfa.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   National Association of Personal Financial Advisors  </a> </u> <br/> 800-366-2732</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 17:42:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 17:42:08.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-tips-for-choosing-the-best-wealth-manager-for-your-business-and-family/\", \"post_id\": \"8143\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 17:42:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 17:42:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-tips-for-choosing-the-best-wealth-manager-for-your-business-and-family\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8142\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3816\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Three-Tips-for-Choosing-the-Best-Wealth-Manager-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"736\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450717200,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3688,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Compelling Reasons to Learn How to Manage Yourself","link":"5-compelling-reasons-to-learn-how-to-manage-yourself","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> We have all made the statement at one time or another, &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t have enough time!&rdquo;. But we all have all the time there is. Time can't be managed, we can only manage ourselves. In this article, I share 5 compelling reasons to learn how to manage yourself.</h3><p> <br/> It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are Bill Gates or a waitress at the diner down the street, God gave us all the same great equalizer - twenty-four hours in a day. What most people lack is not time - but rather, the skills to manage themselves to make good use of the time they have available to them.</p><p> Time is much like money. When you decide to spend an hour watching TV, you have decided to not to spend an hour doing everything else. Productive people don&rsquo;t spend time, they invest it. They expect a return on every hour they invest. Whether time is invested in their business, their family or their own well-being.</p><p>  \"Your time is more valuable than money. Your time is your life!\"</p><p> When you give away your money, you are giving away something that can be replaced. When you give away your time, you are giving them a part of your life. Waste your time and you are wasting your life.</p><p> There are many renewable resources, but time is not one of them.</p><p> Control your time and you are controlling your life. Controlling your time really means controlling the events in your life. People in control of the events in their life are confident, happy, and powerful. They possess one thing above all:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/how-to-find-peace-in-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   inner peace  </a> </u> .</p><p> &ldquo;Productivity&rdquo; is not a new issue. There has been an entire industry built to serve the person who just can&rsquo;t seem to get organized. Everything from Things-To-Do-Today pads, to time management software are available to plan and track personal time usage. Why is then productivity or, shall we say life management, such a challenge? </p><p> As human beings, we tend to blame others for our shortage of time. There are many readily available scapegoats: drop-in visitors, meetings, inadequate equipment, telephone interruptions and one crisis after another. However, the only one to blame is ourselves - for letting our time be wasted. Once again, we cannot manage time; we can only manage ourselves!</p><p> There is another reason time management is such a challenge: conditioning. We&rsquo;ve been conditioned to believe that certain things about ourselves and our surroundings are the truth. As a result of conditioning, many people have adopted myths about their lives as being the truth.</p><p> Visit a circus, and you will see what I mean about conditioning. Take a look at the elephants tied to little stakes that they could easily pull out, yet those little stakes keep the huge elephants tethered.</p><p> When the elephants are young, they are chained by the leg to immovable stakes. However, little by little, over the period of a month, the elephants are conditioned to think they can&rsquo;t move about as long as they are tied by the right rear leg. From the moment this conditioning takes effect, you could tie these elephants with a string and they wouldn&rsquo;t move. They don&rsquo;t move about because they believe they can&rsquo;t. The tethers in their minds are stronger than any chains.</p><h3> <strong>  5 Good Reasons To Learn How To Manage Your Life </strong></h3><p> <br/> The value of time management is not to control time, since time cannot be controlled, but to use time to improve our lives. Time management will not give us more hours in a day, but it will give us a better  <u>  <a href=\"http://succeedwithoutburnout.com/achieve-balance-for-life-by-doing-more-not-less\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   balanced life  </a> </u> :</p><h3> 1. Getting organized reduces stress</h3><p> <br/> Deadlines are a major contributing factor in stress. It is impossible to manage stress without learning to manage our time. In fact, by learning to manage our time, we are learning to prevent stress.</p><p> The better we learn to manage our time, the more we avoid unnecessary stress and the less we need coping techniques. Why learn to cope with stress if we can learn to prevent the stress that time shortages inflict on us?</p><p> If time management equals stress prevention, then time management also prevents illness. Stress is now linked directly to some of our most serious health concerns, heart attacks and strokes being the most common.</p><p> In the business world, this means two things: the loss of some of the brightest and most promising managers, and the rising cost of company-paid health care plans. Stress-induced disability claims are becoming a major headache, not only for insurance companies, but also for employers who are sued for causing the disability.</p><h3> 2. Setting priorities helps achieve balance</h3><p> <br/> Most entrepreneurs are self-motivated people, driven by an unseen force from within to achieve the goals they have set for their lives. Usually, that means the goals they have set for their business.</p><p> Hence, they see little value in helping their employees achieve a balance in their lives. However, it&rsquo;s not only entrepreneurs who are  <u>  <a href=\"http://succeedwithoutburnout.com/17-strategies-to-overcome-burnout-and-achieve-balance-for-life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   addicted to work  </a> </u> .</p><p> A new set of values must accompany new productivity skills in order to bring a balance to the life of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/am-i-a-workaholic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   workaholic  </a> </u> .</p><p> 3. Scheduling eliminates procrastination</p><p> Procrastination is the most common self-inflicted time robber. For the salesperson, it&rsquo;s putting off that phone call. For some, it&rsquo;s putting off the beginning of an exercise program.</p><p> &ldquo;Putting things off&rdquo; has probably caused more time management problems than all the other causes put together. We have a natural tendency to do the things we like and put off the things we don&rsquo;t. We need to develop a sense of urgency for each task and remember that time is of the essence.</p><h3> 4. Life management increases productivity</h3><p> <br/> A good time management system will certainly improve our productivity. The more productive we are, the greater our advantage over our competition.</p><p> The reason that today there is so much &ldquo;downsizing,&rdquo; &ldquo;restructuring,&rdquo; and &ldquo;rightsizing&rdquo; going on in companies really comes down to the issue of productivity. The only way a company or a country can regain its competitive edge is to improve productivity.</p><p> What&rsquo;s productivity anyway? Productivity refers to the relationship between results and resources. In other words, productivity equals output divided by input. This formula demonstrates that there are two ways to improve productivity: to hold output constant while reducing input and to increase output without increasing input.</p><p> How much can we improve our productivity? While very little research has been done in this area, there is some data available that would indicate that the average manager is only 30% effective. Returning phone calls several at a time can reduce the average time spent per call by 50%. Closing your office door and working without interruption for two hours a day will enable you to accomplish what would have taken you three hours before.</p><h3> 5. Increased focus results in goals achieved</h3><p> <br/> All goals must have a deadline. Without a goal, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how long it takes you to arrive.</p><p> That reminds me of the story of the little boy who asks his father as he arrives home from work one day, &ldquo;Daddy, what did you do at work today?&rsquo; &ldquo;Oh, not much, son.&rdquo; replies his Dad.&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; replies the boy &ldquo;how did you know when you were finished?&rdquo;</p><p> There are many times when one activity can be taking you towards two or more goals at the same time.</p><p> For instance, if three of your goals were to spend a half an hour a day exercising, half an hour a day in solitude, half an hour a day in prayer, you could achieve all three at once by praying as you jogged or walked alone for a half an hour.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 17:56:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 17:56:40.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-compelling-reasons-to-learn-how-to-manage-yourself/\", \"post_id\": \"8145\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 17:56:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 17:56:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-compelling-reasons-to-learn-how-to-manage-yourself\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8144\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3817\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Compelling-Reasons-to-Learn-How-to-Manage-Yourself.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"792\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450728900,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3689,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When It Comes to Money, Your Company Should Help You Learn Where You Earn","link":"when-it-comes-to-money-your-company-should-help-you-learn-where-you-earn","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarrieSchwab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.schwab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Charles Schwab  </u> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s a fact of life.  We live in a complicated world full of competing challenges and contradictory opinions. No one-size-fits-all solutions. No magic wands. And yet, every once in a while, a special idea comes along that makes sense on every level &mdash; whether that&rsquo;s ethical, economic, social, or just plain practical.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s one such idea that can have a deep and lasting impact on the future of our country:  <strong>  Workplace financial education and support. </strong></p><h3> Why is this important?</h3><p> <br/> I want to be clear from the get-go about why this is such a crucial issue. Most Americans &mdash; old, young, men, women &mdash; and even those who earn a substantial paycheck &mdash; struggle when it comes to managing their money. Whether this need is as basic as making ends meet on a daily basis, or saving and investing for the future, most of us simply don&rsquo;t have the knowledge or the confidence to make smart and informed financial decisions.</p><p> Certainly this lack of financial literacy has been a serious issue for decades. But its urgency is growing. As I look to the future with life spans increasing, pension plans disappearing, savings rates substantially below where they need to be, government safety nets stressed, and scam artists proliferating, it&rsquo;s an issue we must address &mdash; and now.</p><h3> Why should employers get involved?</h3><p> <br/> So why look to the workplace? For several compelling reasons.</p><p> First, financial stress and instability don&rsquo;t just impact us and our families &mdash; they also erode our ability to be smart, efficient, and productive employees.</p><p> Study after study backs this up. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report &ldquo;Financial Wellness at Work,&rdquo; seven out of 10 American workers say that financial stress is their most common cause of stress. Another study in 2012 revealed that roughly one in five employees admitted to skipping work in the past year to deal with a financial problem. Eldar Shafir, a former colleague of mine on President Obama&rsquo;s Advisory Council on Financial Capability, wrote a book a few years ago called Scarcity, in which he provided evidence that financial scarcity &ldquo;reduces a person&rsquo;s cognitive capacity more than going a full night without sleep.&rdquo;</p><p> So it makes sense for employers from a business perspective, but there&rsquo;s more. The workplace is the ideal venue for financial education because it just makes sense to &lsquo;learn where you earn.&rsquo; We spend more hours connected to our employers than just about anyone else; they have our eyes, ears, and minds. They are the primary source of our financial stability, and hopefully we have a relationship built on trust and mutual gain.</p><p> Third, employers have leverage. We may &lsquo;know&rsquo; that we should be relying on credit cards less, saving more or buying more insurance, but many of us don&rsquo;t tend to do it without a big nudge. And whether that nudge takes the form of an incentive (matching contribution to your 401(k)), encouragement (automatic enrollment in your 401(k)), or a mandate (required training), employers have the power to make us act.</p><p> Fourth, employers have the goods. When you pay someone to perform a task, you have the freedom to structure their compensation in a way that meets multiple goals. This gives employers the unique ability to add broad-based financial education, savings incentives, appropriate insurance coverage, and access to favorable accounts to the mix of benefits. That way, they not only address their employees&rsquo; immediate financial needs with a fair paycheck, but they also build a financially stable workforce for years to come.</p><p> And finally, employees want the help. A recent Gallup poll found that only 6% of employees believe that their organization does things to help them manage their finances more effectively. However, 81% of employees who say financial problems are affecting their productivity would welcome employer financial help and support.</p><h3> What will it take?</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s the rationale &mdash; but what exactly does \"learn where you earn&rdquo; mean in real terms? Three things.</p><li> <strong>  It starts with comprehensive financial education. </strong> The key word here is &lsquo;comprehensive.&rsquo; Many companies have programs to help employees with retirement planning, which is critical &mdash; but I see this as putting the cart before the horse. The fact of the matter is that too many workers are being crushed by credit card debt and student loans. Or they don&rsquo;t have an emergency fund or adequate insurance to see them through an injury or serious illness. Or worse still, they are victimized by predatory lenders or other scam artists. This is where we have to start &mdash; by providing a basic education in budgeting, saving, debt management, and insurance protection. With that under control, we&rsquo;re a position to take on retirement preparedness in a serious and focused way.</li><li> <strong>  We need to expand access to savings plans, whether that&rsquo;s for retirement or other needs. </strong> Currently, only 53% of American workers have access to a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan. For small businesses the number is even lower. Yes, anyone with earned income can contribute to an IRA &ndash; but participation rates are even lower for these accounts. The not-too-surprising result? Approximately half of Americans have NO retirement savings, and the vast majority of others haven&rsquo;t saved adequately. I&rsquo;m hopeful that the newmyRA account, which was launched this month by the U.S. Treasury Department, will help close the gap. But clearly there&rsquo;s much more to be done.</li><li> <strong>  Access is one thing, participation another. </strong> The evidence from behavioral science is indisputable: left to their own devices, humans don&rsquo;t always make decisions that promote their own best interests. Whether those decisions are health- or diet-related, emotional, or financial, we often screw up. But the good news is that we screw up in predictable ways, and with the help of some creative programming, we can be steered in the right direction. Retirement savings matching programs are probably the best-known example. Automatic 401(k) enrollment is a newer but effective device, especially with Google and other forward-thinking companies raising default contributions to as much as 10% to 15% of employees&rsquo; salaries &mdash; levels that are much closer to what is really needed. These programs are on the right track, and provide a model that would be easy for others to duplicate. <br/>  </li><h3> Is it doable?</h3><p> <br/> Always the pragmatist, I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about whether &lsquo;learn where you earn&rsquo; is over-reaching, too pie-in-the-sky. And you know what? I&rsquo;m optimistic, for lots of reasons.</p><p> <strong>  First, </strong> as I&rsquo;ve already stressed, everyone wins. It&rsquo;s not only the right thing to do from a societal perspective, but it&rsquo;s also the right thing for both employers who want a stronger workforce and employees who want to secure their futures.</p><p> <strong>  Second, </strong> and I think this point is essential for everyone to appreciate, a &ldquo;learn where you earn&rdquo; program doesn&rsquo;t have to be expensive. As reported by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, there are many low-cost proven methods for improving employee financial wellness, many of which are easy to implement on a modest budget or simply as an extension of an existing program. Even the smallest of businesses can participate in a way that will benefit their bottom-line.</p><p> <strong>  Finally, </strong> I&rsquo;m optimistic because I&rsquo;m starting to see a few pioneering companies roll out exciting plans. As one example, Charles Schwab Foundation is currently developing a comprehensive program in collaboration with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. Designed to serve the 55,000-strong Boys &amp; Girls Clubs national workforce, and eventually employees of other nonprofits, the program will be piloted in early 2016 and will hopefully serve as a model for workplace programs across the country.</p><p> Of course creating a national movement of workplace financial education won&rsquo;t be easy. There will be questions and doubters. But I strongly believe that this is the wave of the future. It&rsquo;s an idea whose time has come.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 18:13:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 18:13:26.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-it-comes-to-money-your-company-should-help-you-learn-where-you-earn/\", \"post_id\": \"8147\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 18:13:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 18:13:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-it-comes-to-money-your-company-should-help-you-learn-where-you-earn\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8146\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3818\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Your-Company-Should-Help-You-Learn-Where-You-Earn.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"527\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450724400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

However, no definition of either agility or resilience includes any reference to &ldquo;winging it&rdquo;.</h3><p> <br/> All of us, including myself, from time to time need to &ldquo;think on our feet&rdquo;. During these times, we usually do not have the luxury of time or all of the needed information to properly develop a plan of action. So, we act based upon what we do know and from what we&rsquo;ve learned from our past similar experiences. Thinking on your feet is not the same as winging it because winging it does not require or include any form of thinking! It&rsquo;s 100% pure reaction that, for some, serves as a &ldquo;high&rdquo;, like an addictive habit and entices them to continue to use this behavior until they fall (or is it fail? No matter, both are bad.). Winging it is a dangerous habit. So let&rsquo;s look at it more closely:</p><p> <strong>  1. Winging it means that you are always working on a never-ending list of tasks without a shred of strategy (purpose) or planning. </strong> It will never result in sustained long-term success. Does the expression &ldquo;one step forward and two steps back&rdquo;mean anything to you? It should, it could be your life.</p><p> <strong>  2. Winging it only lasts so long before others see that your approach is shallow. </strong> Not only are you wasting your personal credibility assets, but winging it will eventually wear you down and you will have nothing to show for your &ldquo;make work&rdquo; efforts. Does the description &ldquo;building a house of cards&rdquo; mean anything to you?</p><p> <strong>  3. Winging it means you are more concerned with activity as opposed to results. </strong> Your style can be described as &ldquo;ready, fire, aim&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  4. Winging it never lets you learn from your mistakes. </strong> Why? Because you&rsquo;re always involved in looking for the next activity. You can be described in the following way:&ldquo;The good news is you&rsquo;re making great time; the bad news is you&rsquo;re lost!&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  5. Finally, because you never really learn from your mistakes, you never get to expand your learning. </strong> If you don&rsquo;t learn, you cannot get better. And, when you don&rsquo;t get better, both you and your business will stall and begin a downward path to failure.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-20 18:30:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-20 18:30:00.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/winging-it-does-not-require-or-include-any-form-of-thinking/\", \"post_id\": \"8149\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-20 18:30:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-20 18:30:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"winging-it-does-not-require-or-include-any-form-of-thinking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8148\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3819\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winging-It.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"522\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450729500,"author_id":109,"chart_url":""}

So I realize &ndash; now more than ever &ndash; the importance of living what I refer to as our  &ldquo;Best Business Life&rdquo;  &ndash; that is, a life of congruence between what we believe and how we act.</p><p> When I started my career as a young accountant, and then a &ldquo;youngish&rdquo; recruiter for accountants, I dutifully followed direction- preparing spreadsheets, meeting deadlines, making deals and hitting my bogeys. Looking back, this was all somewhat mindless; there was little sanction for asking myself what I wanted to be doing or what I felt passionate or excited about. Having just graduated college and married a man who was fresh out of law school with a heavy student loan burden, we had taken a mortgage on a new townhouse, and then topped that off with a desire to have children. Our goal was to eventually give them a life of abundance &ndash; &ldquo;The &ldquo;American Dream&rdquo;, so to speak.</p><p> I worked because it was a means to an end&mdash;and the only way I knew how to solve for all that we wanted to achieve. Turns out, I hated accounting and loved recruiting, and my early years as a headhunter paved the way for what eventually became Diamond Consultants. Almost 3 decades, 4 jobs, and 2 children later, I feel as though I am now living my  Best Business Life .</p><p> While my work has afforded me a nice living and a modicum of success, truth be told, the spark I feel has little to do with money or a means to an end.</p><p> It&rsquo;s all about my ability to be true to my core values and beliefs every day. That is, to put into action what feels soulful to me and to have the opportunity to share what I have come to understand about life with complete objectivity and integrity, free from worry about deadlines, quotas or productivity.</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t that I am not a capitalist or that I am running a charity instead of a business, but rather that when my actions &ndash; how I live my life &ndash; actually match my true self, I feel fulfilled and whole, and more often than not, the money follows.</p><p> I also know what it is like to experience the opposite of congruence. For years I suffered from panic attacks: that sense of dread and certainty that something catastrophic was about to happen. Most of the time, nothing really bad did happen, but the feeling was very real and pretty painful. What I know now is that those panic attacks were my body and mind&rsquo;s way of telling me that my soul wasn&rsquo;t being paid enough attention; that I was pushing myself too hard and was spending my time on things that didn&rsquo;t quite fit anymore. I felt trapped by the things I thought I &ldquo;should&rdquo; want to do but, in reality, hated&mdash;like accounting.</p><p> Freeing myself to ask the question,  &ldquo;What do I really want to do with my life?&rdquo;  allowed me to make choices and take action that felt congruent and &ldquo;right&rdquo;. Many of the advisors I meet grapple with whether or not they believe that their firm continues to be the best place to serve their clients and to grow their business into the enterprise they believe it should be. As feel-good wealth management shops morphed into bank-owned behemoths in the last number of years, advisors looking for a greater sense of control, flexibility and freedom to change jerseys as a way to reignite passion, to create congruency and to feel, once again, that they are serving clients as true fiduciaries.</p><p> Before jumping ship, many of these folks said things like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not having fun anymore,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I love my clients, but I&rsquo;m unable to serve them the way I want to because our compliance department manages to the lowest common denominator and cuts me off at the knees.&rdquo;</p><p> Without knowing it, they were describing incongruence between what their souls were telling them and how they were able to live their business lives.</p><p> At the end of most of my 8-10 hour workdays, I feel energized, productive and good about the work I&rsquo;ve done, knowing that I guided others as I would want to be guided. It&rsquo;s a feeling that I know everyone wants to have, but are never really sure how to achieve.</p><p> So consider asking yourself this:  Am I doing what I want, where I want and in a way that feels right?</p><p> Within the answers lie the congruence you seek&mdash;and the path to your  Best Business Life .</p> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-21 20:18:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-21 20:18:40.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-do-i-really-want-to-do/\", \"post_id\": \"8150\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-21 20:18:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-21 20:18:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-do-i-really-want-to-do\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8148\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3820\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winging-It.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"434\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450774800,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

The idea is to get beyond perfect and work on just getting better.</p><p> Nothing worthwhile&mdash;training to run a marathon, losing weight, taking strokes off your golf game or saving for retirement&mdash;happens by accident and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Making changes, even small changes, begins with a decision to move out of your comfort zone towards something worthwhile. </p><p> When Jane and Tom came to see me, they shared a determined look.</p><p> &ldquo;We have ignored our financial lives for the last 40 years and now we&rsquo;re scared,&rdquo; stated Tom.</p><p> &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;tell me more. Help me understand what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p><p> Jane answered, &ldquo;I just know that all our lives, we&rsquo;ve made money and spent money and never thought too much about it. We&rsquo;ve had ups and downs, but we always seemed to be able to do pretty much what we wanted.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The fact is, I&rsquo;ve tried my best, but I really don&rsquo;t know too much about making good financial decisions. While I am really good at what I do, I just don&rsquo;t have the knowledge to make sure we can get there,&rdquo; Tom said.</p><p> &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rdquo;?&rdquo; I asked.&rdquo; Any changes you make have to be aligned with what you both care MOST about. Have you discussed what you value most?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Do you mean, have we actually sat down and talked about this specifically? No, we haven&rsquo;t. Do people really do that?&rdquo; Jane asked.</p><p> &ldquo;In making potentially big changes, you both need to be in agreement about your mission. If not, failure is pretty well assured.&rdquo;</p><p> In the course of this conversation Jane and Tom came to realize that there was no quick fix. But they learned that by shifting their focus onto the areas that are most important to THEM, they could start making decisions that matched their mission.</p><p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not used to talking about money and making these decisions together. What if we don&rsquo;t agree?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p><p> &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect. In fact, it won&rsquo;t be&mdash;ever. But your situation will get better and better with practice. If you don&rsquo;t agree, then you both have to agree to do nothing until you find common ground. After all, the decision of one impacts both, so you both must agree to whatever ground rules you establish to make decisions based on your values.

Failure to stop the wrong behaviors, condones them and feeds the dark force.</li><li> Insecurity: &ldquo;If I act tough, no one will see how scared I am.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s impossible to manage well if you&rsquo;re wrestling with your own self-doubt.</li><li> Incompetence: &ldquo;Fake it till you make it,&rdquo; is a terrible approach to management. Far better to play to your strengths and get the support you need in other arenas.</li><li> Greed: If it&rsquo;s all about you, your team will see right through.</li><li> Scarcity Mindset: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not enough _______ (resources, bonus money, promotions) to go around.&rdquo; The behaviors that mindset drives are self-fulfilling. When you don&rsquo;t invest&hellip;in training, tools, relationships&hellip;you stifle the growth you could have achieved with a more generous spirit.</li><li> Drunk on Power: Relying on position to get things done may be efficient, but drains the life-force out of otherwise effective employees.</li><li> Misunderstood Role Models: A lot of times leaders get to their positions DESPITE a bad habit or two.

{"original_id":3695,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Great Marital Advice Based on 1,076 Years of Marriage","link":"great-marital-advice-based-on-1076-years-of-marriage","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As I write this, I am one week away from getting married (December 19, 2015). Last week, I asked my Facebook friends if they had any marital advice. I&rsquo;ve been dispensing advice daily for more than one thousand days so thought they could return the favor of their wisdom.</p><p> I expected everything from the deepest of hearts to the humorous to the incendiary &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; My friends, however, are a wonderful bunch and kept it relatively clean. (I use the term &ldquo;relatively&rdquo; very sloppily.)</p><p> In my solicitation, I asked them to include the number of years they are or were happily married as well as which number marriage they were enjoying. </p><p> All told, I received 2,296 words of wisdom from sixty-seven people who combined for a whopping 1,076 years of marital, uh, experience. (It took me longer to calculate those statistics than it did to write the post if you must know.)</p><p> It was even more difficult to make the post exactly 1,076 words of content&mdash;one word for every year of my friends&rsquo; marital experience. Seems silly, I know, but I&rsquo;m silly. So there.</p><p> This was my interpretation of their advice. Let&rsquo;s have at it!</p><h3> On Your Wedding Day&mdash;It&rsquo;s a Fast Pain <br/>  </h3><p> Stay present! It&rsquo;s over faster than the pain you&rsquo;ll endure from the cost of that highfalutin place you&rsquo;re getting married in. Oh, and make sure to chill out when things don&rsquo;t go as planned. They won&rsquo;t. Take it in stride.</p><h3> Have Lots of Butts&hellip;of Your Jokes <br/>  </h3><p> Make each other smile. Make each other laugh and laugh with each other. (I know. I reread that sentence a few times myself. Almost a palindrome. But not.) Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll love each other enough to laugh at each other.</p><h3> Communicate&mdash;Use Words But Other Stuff Works Too <br/>  </h3><p> Communication seems to be the key. I remember a year or so ago I was dining at my parents&rsquo; house. They celebrated fifty years of marriage last year. Dad and Mom cited communication as one of the three big reasons people get divorced.</p><p> One of my Facebook friends added, &ldquo;When things get rough, a long walk with no phone can do wonders. Many problems can be solved with a two-mile walk.&rdquo; I know this works with my dogs. I hope it works with my spouse.</p><h3> The Bed is a Place for Lots of Fun Things but Being Angry Isn&rsquo;t One of Them <br/>  </h3><p> Several agreed going to bed angry is a no-no. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you&rsquo;ll wake up after a few nightmares. If you&rsquo;re unlucky, you wake up with some bruises.</p><h3> Show and Tell isn&rsquo;t Just for the Classroom <br/>  </h3><p> The telling part is good. The showing part is better. Actions speak louder than words. Tell each other, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Show each other I love you.</p><h3> Lose the Scorecard <br/>  </h3><p> Keeping score is not only unhealthy but oftentimes you&rsquo;re not even using the same scoring system! Instead of keeping track, just keep doing. It&rsquo;ll come back to you in many different ways.</p><h3> Apologies Have Bigger Muscles Than Being Right <br/>  </h3><p> Whoever apologizes first is bravest no matter who is right.</p><h3> Keep Dating&mdash;Whaaaaaa? <br/>  </h3><p> Each other. Apparently dating shouldn&rsquo;t stop once you&rsquo;re married. If I would have known, I would have tried this marriage thing a long time ago.</p><h3> Pretend Your Spouse is Your Dog <br/>  </h3><p> I couldn&rsquo;t make this stuff up. My dear friend (I&rsquo;m not naming names, Ray) said as long as we treat each other like we treat our fur baby Dachshunds, we&rsquo;d be golden. You have no idea how right he is.</p><h3> Aretha Knew What She was Singin&rsquo; About <br/>  </h3><p> Make sure to r-e-s-p-e-c-t each other&mdash;always. The words &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; should be on your tongue&rsquo;s speed dial. Gratitude should be a daily feeling.</p><h3> Keep Watching Sports&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> &hellip;because marriage is a like a batting average. No one is perfect. If I remember correctly, guys who bat 0.333 go to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. I&rsquo;m guessing an average of 0.333 will get me into the Divorce Court Hall of Fame.</p><h3> Polygamy is Apparently Legal Everywhere <br/>  </h3><p> One friend had an astute observation. He said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t marry one person. You marry three: the person she is, the person you think she is, and the person she will become as a result of being married to you.&rdquo; After I read his remark, the first question I wanted to ask him was, &ldquo;Which one of these three people should I look at when I say, &lsquo;I do&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><h3> Compromising with Each Other is One Thing but Compromising with Yourself? <br/>  </h3><p> My friend who believes in &ldquo;polygamy&rdquo; offered that your spouse might have compromised before she presents you with options. Love this. I&rsquo;ll make sure to ask her, whenever she gives me options, how much previous negotiating she already did with herself!</p><h3> Dividing then Conquering is Better than Conquering then Dividing <br/>  </h3><p> There were so many golden nuggets to toss into this one, but a few of my favorites were related to balance and mathematical division. Doing things together is wonderful, but make sure you have opportunities for yourself. I also love the remarks I received about marriage being 100%/100% as opposed to 50%/50%. One hundred percent of both will work out much better than fifty-percent.</p><h3> The Size of the Gift Shouldn&rsquo;t be Measured in Square Footage <br/>  </h3><p> The big gifts to each other will not be as impactful as the small, thoughtful gifts. I completely agree. I can&rsquo;t wait to see whether my fianc&eacute;es agrees when it comes to diamond gifts. Just kidding. She would agree as well.</p><h3> Make Sure You Know the Difference Between the Id, Ego, and Superego <br/>  </h3><p> Apparently, only two of these are required to live a happy marriage. You can figure out which one should go. If you can&rsquo;t, Google it.</p><h3> &ldquo;Never&rdquo; and &ldquo;Always&rdquo; Should, uh, Never be Used <br/>  </h3><p> While &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; should be on your tongue&rsquo;s speed dial, the words &ldquo;Never&rdquo; and &ldquo;Always&rdquo; should be erased from your vocabulary. I&rsquo;m assuming sentences such as, &ldquo;I will never hurt you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will always love you,&rdquo; are exceptions.</p><h3> You Get Amnesia the Moment You Get Married <br/>  </h3><p> Never assume your spouse knows how much you love him or her. Feel free to remind him or her on a daily basis. I guess this was also an appropriate use of the word &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p><h3> Make Sure You&rsquo;re an Ace with Pronouns <br/>  </h3><p> You shouldn&rsquo;t start sentences with the word &ldquo;You.&rdquo; Choose instead to start sentences with &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Take responsibility for your response and your actions. Own them.</p><h3> As always, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you: What is your best marital advice?</h3>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-21 20:40:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-21 20:40:04.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/great-marital-advice-based-on-1076-years-of-marriage/\", \"post_id\": \"8158\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-21 20:40:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-21 20:40:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"great-marital-advice-based-on-1076-years-of-marriage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8157\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3824\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Great-Marital-Advice-Based-on-1076-Years-of-Marriage-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"505\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450803600,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3696,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Status in the Age of Vermeer","link":"social-status-in-the-age-of-vermeer","source_link":null,"content":"<p> By the 17th century, the Netherlands had developed a major financial industry and thriving maritime commerce in goods produced by the country&rsquo;s textile mills, dairy farms, herring fisheries, and  <u>  <a href=\"https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-dutch-economy-in-the-golden-age-16th-17th-centuries/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sugar  </a> </u>  refineries. The resulting large and diverse middle class supplies the rich subject matter for a portrait exhibit at Boston&rsquo;s Museum of Fine Arts.</p><p> The paintings in &ldquo;Class Distinctions: Dutch Painting in the Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer&rdquo; are grouped into one of the three classes: the upper crust, the middle classes, and the laborers and indigent.</p><p> The Dutch elite &ndash; nobility, textile merchants, and wealthy landowners &ndash; commissioned portraits &ldquo;to express and affirm their status,&rdquo; according to exhibit materials. These paintings are replete with class symbols, such as the gleaming armor worn by princes to highlight their privilege as well as military prowess. The status symbols in the exhibit&rsquo;s signature 1665 painting above by Johannes Vermeer, &ldquo;A Lady Writing,&rdquo; go beyond the silver inkwell and pearls on the woman&rsquo;s writing table. Status is also implied in what she is doing: &ldquo;The very act of writing tells us she is educated and literate and has the leisure time to write letters,&rdquo; the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/class-distinctions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   exhibit  </a> </u>  states.</p><p> But in the Golden Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer, the true sign of prosperity was the Dutch middle-class, which was the largest and most highly stratified class. This big tent took in everything from trained professionals and skilled artisans to modest shopkeepers. Middle class people might be extremely wealthy shipbuilders, successful goldsmiths, respected barbers (who performed minor medical procedures), or modest tailors and bakers. They were also often defined by &ldquo;the [investment] capital at their disposal,&rdquo; which distinguished them from the rich who inherited their wealth and the poor who earned low wages by selling their unskilled labor.</p><h3> The Shipbuilder and his Wife <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2.-The-Shipbuilder-and-his-Wife_Rembrandt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"The Shipbuilder and his Wife\" src=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2.-The-Shipbuilder-and-his-Wife_Rembrandt.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> &ldquo;The very top of the middle class&rdquo; can be seen in the above 1663 masterpiece, &ldquo;The Shipbuilder and his Wife.&rdquo; The shipbuilder, Jan Rijcksen, an investor in the Dutch East India Company, was so well-off that he could afford to commission a portrait by the most fashionable painter in Amsterdam: Rembrandt van Rijn. In the painting, Rijcksen is receiving an urgent letter from his wife, Griet Jans.</p><h3> Interior with Women beside a Linen Cupboard <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/9.-Interior-with-Women-beside-a-Linen-Cupboard_de-Hooch.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Interior with Women beside a Linen Cupboard\" src=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/9.-Interior-with-Women-beside-a-Linen-Cupboard_de-Hooch.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Another indication of Dutch wealth was women&rsquo;s ability to become full-time housewives. Pieter de Hooch&rsquo;s 1663 painting above, &ldquo;Interior with Women beside a Linen Cupboard,&rdquo; emphasized the linen cabinet, often the most expensive piece of furniture in the middle-class home. The woman in the fur collar (left) is showing her daughter how to care for the family&rsquo;s prized linens. As middle-class women gained their independence, some worked out of their homes, for example, making lace for sale; widows were also allowed to take over their late husband&rsquo;s shops.</p><h3> View of the Plain of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Haarlem-Bleaching-Grounds.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Haarlem Bleaching Grounds\" src=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Haarlem-Bleaching-Grounds.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Perhaps the most interesting painting of the &ldquo;lower classes&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a portrait. &ldquo;View of the Plain of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds&rdquo; by Jacob van Ruisdael in the early 1660s (above) is an appealing landscape that, on close inspection, shows laborers off in the distance doing the arduous work of spreading heavy strips of wet linens, soaked in buttermilk, on the grass to dry and bleach under the sun. This low-level and &ldquo;back-breaking&rdquo; work was primarily performed by women who earned &ldquo;miserable wages,&rdquo; the exhibit said. &ldquo;Ruisdael gives no hint of their misery in this sweeping, majestic paean to his native city.&rdquo;</p><h3> A Maid Milking a Cow in a Barn <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.-A-Maid-Milking-a-Cow-in-a-Barn_ter-Borch.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"A Maid Milking a Cow in a Barn\" src=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.-A-Maid-Milking-a-Cow-in-a-Barn_ter-Borch.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Dutch cattle produced more milk than anywhere in Europe and were often proudly depicted in paintings. Milking cows was a low-status job, however, and the woman in &ldquo;A Maid Milking a Cow in a Barn&rdquo; (above) by Gerard ter Borch in 1652-54 was probably either a farmer&rsquo;s wife or a wage-earning maid who extracted milk for the domestic butter industry or cheese exporters.</p><h3> Interior of an Inn <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11.-Interior-of-an-Inn_Brouwer.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Interior of an Inn\" src=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/11.-Interior-of-an-Inn_Brouwer.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Moralizing was popular in Dutch paintings. Indigent men in &ldquo;Interior of an Inn,&rdquo; by Adriaen Brouwer in 1630, are shown guzzling beer or are either asleep and snoring or vomiting. Paintings with themes of sloth and gluttony appealed to wealthy and educated buyers, according to the exhibit.</p><h3> Street Musicians at the Door <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4.-Street-Musicians-at-the-Door_Ochtervelt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Street Musicians at the Door\" src=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4.-Street-Musicians-at-the-Door_Ochtervelt.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> In the final room of the exhibit, the curator of &ldquo;Class Distinctions,&rdquo; Ronni Baer, assembled paintings of the town square and other public places where the various classes mingled in liberal 1600s Dutch society. In the above painting, however, musicians have knocked on the door of a wealthy household to entertain them.

{"original_id":3697,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Your Website Affects Your Customer's Decisions","link":"how-your-website-affects-your-customers-decisions","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> You might be surprised to know how your prospects are using your company website.  <strong>  Customers are usually not looking for specific products and services; they&rsquo;re looking to form solution sets &mdash; possible solutions to the issues they face. </strong>  Your virtual presence (website content, social media activity) can help your customers find your website and advance your product/service over competing products or services.</p><p> In order to understand, help, and sell to your customers, you have to put yourself in their shoes. When your customers browse the Internet, how often are they actively looking for products and services to buy?  <a href=\"http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/posts/archive/2014/03/21/5-reasons-visitors-leave-your-website.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Chances are, not very often </a> .  <strong>  Customers are not looking for products and services in most cases; they&rsquo;re using websites for research. </strong>  Your website can help your customers find solutions to their problems.  Here&rsquo;s how:</p><h3> Be Solutions-Oriented and Customer-Focused; Not Salesy <br/>  </h3><p> Your website should help your customers solve a problem. As such, any advertising or marketing message that&rsquo;s on your site should aim to provide a solution for your customer first before selling them on something.</p><p> If you sell plumbing services, for example, then your website should offer specific plumbing advice, such as how to clear a clogged drain. If your customers can&rsquo;t resolve the problem on their own, your site should encourage them to give you a call.</p><h3> Could you use a second set of eyes in order to make your website more customer-friendly?</h3><p> Similarly, a CPA firm could use their website to tell people when they need to file amended tax returns. Alongside this information, you might include a button to call your firm to prepare the actual return.</p><p> <strong>  If you offer solutions, then your customers will find your company and consequently your products and services. </strong></p><h3> Build an Extensive Knowledge Base <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Why do companies blog? Because blogging is a relatively easy way to build a library of content that&rsquo;s well optimized for a potential customer&rsquo;s search for information. </strong>  Some websites have hundreds of pages of valuable information which helps customers work through and solve their problems.</p><p> <strong>  The juggling act that you have to manage is to create a website that&rsquo;s useful for your customers and also encourages them to take action. </strong></p><p> In order to give customers a good reason to come to your website, you need to:</p><li> Establish your company as the expert in your field by writing articles and publications about the latest industry topics. You can also showcase your expertise through  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/27-reasons-consider-video-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   videos  </a> </u> , interviews and podcasts.</li><li> Tell your customers exactly what they need to do to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/start-blogging-more-effective-business-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fix the problems  </a> </u>  they have (e.g. our example above about when to file amended tax returns)</li><li> Suggest products or services that may make their lives easier (to continue our example, placing a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/ingredients-for-an-effective-call-to-action/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   call to action  </a> </u>  on the page that links to a page about amended tax preparation or a call to action to ask a tax expert a question). <br/>  </li><p> If you want your customers to trust you and make a purchase from your site, you need to offer them helpful information and advice that draws on your expertise. Building an extensive knowledge base via a company blog and establishing your employees as an experts in your industry are the two most important steps you can take to attract more business from your website.</p><p> <strong>  Could you use a second set of eyes in order to make your website more customer-friendly? </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-21 20:55:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-21 20:55:33.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-your-website-affects-your-customers-decisions/\", \"post_id\": \"8162\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-21 20:55:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-21 20:55:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-your-website-affects-your-customers-decisions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8161\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3826\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-Your-Website-Affects-Your-Customers-Decisions-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"447\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450800000,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3698,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Getting into Gratitude to Improve Your Sales","link":"getting-into-gratitude-to-improve-your-sales-2","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Let&rsquo;s face it, sales can be a hard profession. If you&rsquo;re on a commission only basis, then you know how easy it is to go from hero to zero at the beginning of each month as your quota starts over. <br/>  </h3><p> You are constantly under pressure to make all kinds of numbers and metrics &ndash; number of calls, appointments, closes and revenues. If you&rsquo;re in management, then you are also responsible for each team member and the goals of the whole department. If you&rsquo;re an owner, then you often have the pressure of the board or the share holders to make your quarterly numbers or grow your market share.</p><p> What can make this profession especially hard is that it seems as if the battle to make all these numbers is fought one sale at a time, and each no you get takes a little bit from you and many no&rsquo;s in a row can really bring your confidence down. So how can you stay positive and keep your attitude where it needs to be to keep picking up the phone, calling on those prospects and persevering to make a sale?</p><p> After years of struggling with these same challenges, I&rsquo;ve found a reliable and consistent way to keep myself focused and smiling and dialing and contacting one prospect after the next. The great thing about it is that it costs no money, takes very little time, and I can do it anywhere and at anytime. It&rsquo;s a method I never grow tire of, and, best of all, it always works to restore my attitude, my hope and my perspective. It&rsquo;s called writing a gratitude list.</p><p> I was taught long ago that when things didn&rsquo;t seem to be going my way, or if I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;getting mine&rdquo; or if I began feeling sorry for myself, then it was time for me to stop and make a list of all the things I already had and to focus on how grateful I was to have them. I was told that many times we&rsquo;re so focused on what we have to have next that we often forget to acknowledge and truly appreciate the things we already have and how fortunate we already are. Writing a gratitude list restores that appreciation and helps me to focus on the things that are truly important.</p><p> Writing a gratitude list is easy. You simply get a piece of paper, or make a list in a notes section of your smart phone or computer, and start with a number of things you&rsquo;re going to list that you&rsquo;re grateful for in your life. I&rsquo;ve found that 25 items is a perfect amount for one sitting as it gets filled easily up to about 16, then I have to search deeper to find the other treasures in my life. If you think that you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find even 10 or 15 things you&rsquo;re grateful for, don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; once you get started, you&rsquo;ll be surprised by how rich you truly are. Here&rsquo;s a sample list to help remind you and get you started:</p><p> Often times I will break things down into categories to help prompt me. I always start with the most important thing of all, health. It&rsquo;s interesting how I&rsquo;m immediately grateful for the ability to walk, to see, or to do anything physical whenever I&rsquo;m in public and I see someone in a wheel chair or disabled in some way. Instantly I&rsquo;m reminded of how fortunate I am and of how I take such important things for granted.</p><h3> Spending a few minutes to really cherish my health has amazing positive benefits. I often list things like this: <br/>  </h3><p> 1. I&rsquo;m grateful for my total health today, and I&rsquo;m reminded that as long as I have my health, I have hope. And hope is the start of everything.</p><p> 2. I&rsquo;m grateful I&rsquo;m healthy enough to go to the gym, and that I can run, box, lift weights and get my endorphins going.</p><p> 3. I&rsquo;m grateful I can sleep at night and wake up without pain; that I am not enduring the challenges that a disease or diagnosis would impose on me and my loved ones.</p><p> 4. I&rsquo;m grateful that I can choose to eat a healthy meal; that I have food choices and abundant fresh water available to me and nearby whenever I want or need it.</p><p> 5. I&rsquo;m grateful for my Starbucks card :&ndash;)</p><p> As you can see, this can go on and on and sometimes does. Here are other categories in no particular order. Again, I use them as needed, and I expand and add to them regularly. Here is just a sample &ndash; by no means a complete list &ndash; of the things that might be included in each category. I&rsquo;m sure that with just a little bit of thought you can add many of your items in each.</p><h3> Work and opportunity: <br/>  </h3><p> 6. I&rsquo;m grateful that I have a job (or business) that gives me the opportunity to be of service and to make a living. If I&rsquo;m in sales, then I have a company that provides me everything I need to succeed. They pay for the building, the rent, the products, the phones, the back office support, the training, the leads, etc.</p><p> 7. I get paid to find people to be of service to! Wow, what an honor! My day always goes better when I remember that I&rsquo;m here to find ways to help people rather than to get something.</p><p> 8. Because I&rsquo;m in commission sales, I can make as much money as I want! How fortunate am I? If I want a raise, all I have to do is find more companies or people who could benefit from my product or service and then meet them. Next year I could buy another home or car or move closer to retirement. Wow, I&rsquo;m so blessed to have so much opportunity&hellip;</p><p> 9. If I don&rsquo;t have a job right now, then I have nothing but opportunity and I can do virtually anything I choose &ndash; the training, the colleges, the jobs, the opportunities are there for me to do anything I decide I want to do.</p><h3> Family is always at the top of the list: <br/>  </h3><p> 10. I&rsquo;m grateful for my family and their health. I&rsquo;m grateful for their love and support and the privilege I have to be in their life and the opportunity I have to add to their lives.</p><p> 11. I&rsquo;m truly grateful for the unconditional love I feel from my family.</p><p> 12. I&rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity to provide for them the life I&rsquo;ve had or didn&rsquo;t have and for the opportunity to share in their lives as their futures unfold.</p><p> 13. I&rsquo;m grateful for the family get together this Thanksgiving and over the holidays. Though I may not always like them all on the same day, I do love and appreciate them for who they are and for what they add to my life.</p><p> This category and the ones before it can be a list of 25 items by themselves as you can see. We truly have so much to be grateful for. Here are 12 other random items that can also be expanded. As you read them, you might want to make a list of others that you think of as you go through them:</p><p> 14. I&rsquo;m grateful for my love of photography and for the wonderful cameras, books, and programs available to me.</p><p> 15. I&rsquo;m grateful to be alive in the beginning of the 21st century! I love technology and all the wonderful things it affords me.</p><p> 16. I love my new iPhone 5!</p><p> 17. I&rsquo;m grateful for God and for my understanding of and relationship with Him.</p><p> 18. I&rsquo;m grateful for having my own business and for the freedom I have to take an occasionally half day on Friday and sneak off to the movies to see the new James Bond film on opening day!</p><p> 19. I&rsquo;m grateful I have a roof over my head and that my family didn&rsquo;t have to endure days and nights without electricity or suffer the loss of life and home as many others did during hurricane Sandy.</p><p> 20. I&rsquo;m grateful I can contribute to the relief effort simply by picking up my phone and texting to the Red Cross or by visiting their website: https://www.redcross.org/</p><p> 21. I&rsquo;m grateful for my goals and plans for 2013 and for the opportunities to achieve them.</p><p> 22. I&rsquo;m grateful for the wealth of great books, CD&rsquo;s, and other programs that keep my attitude focused on what&rsquo;s possible.</p><p> 23. I&rsquo;m grateful for the NFL! I can&rsquo;t wait to be at our local sports bar cheering on my surprising Tampa Bay Buccaneers!</p><p> 24. I&rsquo;m grateful for the unconditional love from the pets in my life.</p><p> 25. I&rsquo;m eternally grateful that I have the awareness and ability to stop and write a gratitude list like this&hellip;</p><p> Now I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I already feel So Much Better. And I felt pretty good before I wrote this list! For me, the real magic of writing a gratitude list is that it takes the focus off of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it for me&rdquo; and &ldquo;where&rsquo;s mine?&rdquo; and puts it back where it should be &ndash; on what I can do for you. You see, when I take just a few minutes to acknowledge how truly rich and blessed I am right now, it&rsquo;s so much easier to want to share this attitude with others. It&rsquo;s so much easier to truly want to help others rather than to get something by closing a sale. And developing an attitude of giving rather than getting is what makes everything I do so much more rewarding.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-11-22 18:57:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-11-22 18:57:07.000000","image_url":"2016/11/article_placeholder_1DWUvIO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/getting-into-gratitude-to-improve-your-sales-2/\", \"post_id\": \"15627\", \"post_date\": \"2016-11-22 18:57:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-11-22 18:57:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"getting-into-gratitude-to-improve-your-sales-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"15626\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"7500\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/getting-gratitude-improve-your-sales-0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"859\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"personal-development/ever-wonder-why-do-bad-things-keep-happening-me\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/09/stop-marketing-build-relationships-influencers/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"wpcf-homeslideroption\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1479942000,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

This year, we&rsquo;ve made a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/testimonials/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lot of great things happen  </a> </u>  for clients old and new. You&rsquo;ll see a lot of ho-hum advice about how you have to &ldquo;optimize for mobile&rdquo; or &ldquo;focus on content marketing&rdquo; or &ldquo;track big data&rdquo; &mdash; but we find these suggestions to be tired and, quite frankly, beaten to death over the years.</p><p> These aren&rsquo;t the only marketing trends you will see in 2016 but are the ones that will give you the best results.</p><h3> 8 Marketing Trends For 2016 <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Live marketing will take center stage. <br/>  </h3><p> At least one form of live marketing should be in your arsenal come 2016. With the debut of exciting channels like SnapChat, Periscope, Meerkat and Blab in 2015, these platforms are likely to see significant growth in the year to come. These sites are great ways to:</p><li> &ndash; Show your team hard at work behind the scenes</li><li> &ndash; Promote time-sensitive offers</li><li> &ndash; Give consumers sneak peeks of new releases</li><li> &ndash; Showcase product demos and tutorials</li><li> &ndash; Generate excitement over sweepstakes</li><li> &ndash; Answer frequently-asked questions, and</li><li> &ndash; Collaborate with influencers. <br/>  </li><h3> See how Mod Girl&reg; client  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.roxyplasticsurgery.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ROXY Plastic Surgery  </a> </u>  uses  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/ohio-plastic-surgeon-dr-k-roxanne-grawe-offers-insider-look-at-plastic-surgery-procedures-on-snapchat-648332.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Snapchat  </a> </u> . <br/>  </h3><p> Marketers are already buzzing about ways they&rsquo;ll use new virtual reality platforms like Oculus Rift to live-stream events. For instance, Elle magazine is planning a fashion show that gives consumer access to exciting interactive environments.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2419469/4-marketing-trends-to-watch-for-in-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Senior VP Kevin O&rsquo;Malley explained  </a> </u> : &ldquo;That could be a tiki hut jutting over gentle waters in Polynesia, or it could be front row at a fashion show that they normally only see on TV, where they can see the celebrities who are there. It&rsquo;s quite another thing to be front row and when you turn to your left, you are sitting next to celebrity X, Y or Z.&rdquo;</p><p> You May Also Like:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-periscope-drives-more-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 Ways to Use Periscope to Drive More Sales  </a> </u></p><h3> 2. Storytelling expertise is a must. <br/>  </h3><p> For years, we heard &ldquo;Content is King, Content is King,&rdquo; so we invested in producing more content. Of course, more isn&rsquo;t all there is to it. Your messages need to be compelling and sell a personal narrative that makes your brand unique. Your target audience expects you to know a lot about their preferences and tailor your messages to suit them.

Social networks are the new SEO. <br/>  </h3><p> Marketers will need to think of social networks as their Search Engine Optimization investments. It&rsquo;s no longer all about Google. Though Google currently handles about two-thirds of search traffic, a huge chunk of the populace is shifting to social media searches. Consider these stats:</p><li> &ndash; Twitter handles over 19 billion search queries a month (more than 5x the volume of Bing!)</li><li> &ndash; Facebook handles about 1 billion search queries a day.</li><li> &ndash; YouTube receives over 3.7 billion search queries a month.</li><li> &ndash;  <u>  One recent survey </u>  found 87% of respondents went directly to Pinterest for advice &amp; opinions on what to buy.</li><li> &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.briansolis.com/2015/01/25-disruptive-technology-trends-2015-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Another  </a>  <a href=\"http://www.briansolis.com/2015/01/25-disruptive-technology-trends-2015-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    survey  </a> </u>  revealed that 80% of consumers are heavily influenced by online reviews, comments and social media recommendations.  <br/>  </li><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalistmag.com/lob/sales-marketing/2015/10/22/social-media-matters-6-content-social-media-trend-predictions-2016-03633252\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital List Mag  </a> </u>  explains that customers will likely flock to social media sites searching for product image and video-based content, which they view as more trustworthy.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/04/11/why-social-is-the-new-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Neil Patel  </a> </u>  advises businesses to &ldquo;stay active on your social networks: pay attention to them, curate them, improve them, enhance them, and remain plugged into this valuable resource.&rdquo; </p><p> You May Also Like:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-social-media-affects-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 Ways Social Media Affects Your SEO  </a> </u></p><h3> 5.

The line between paid advertising and organic content becomes blurry &mdash; but people are largely cool with that, as long as the message is relevant, timely, and not too in-your-face.

Our presentation features a slide that demonstrates financial planning as a clear value that helps justify an advisor fee.</p><p> As we gave our presentation, we quickly saw that our audience wanted to talk about advisor fees. Their key question: is the decline of advisor fees inevitable? This interest intrigued us, and over the last six months, we&rsquo;ve worked with our marketing team to fully understand the landscape and to hone our position on how to guide advisors on the topic. We have an upcoming advisor fee white paper;  <u>  you can see the executive summary </u>  here . For the paper, we teamed up with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bobveres.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bob Veres  </a> </u> , an industry expert with a particular passion about advisor fees.</p><p> <strong>  Fork in the Road </strong> <br/> We think that the industry is at a fork in the road on advisor fees. The direction that an advisor should take is individually based their unique circumstances.</p><p> The status quo is that advisors typically charge a fee based on the AUM that they manage for a client. However, disruptive forces in our industry are driving change. These include:</p><li> The original robo-advisors (for this post, we will assume that no advisors are involved), charge about 25 basis points for basic asset management. Some investors perceive, however, that they are receiving &ldquo;advice&rdquo; on their investments for that low fee&mdash;so why should they pay an advisor more?</li><li> Clients are becoming more investment-savvy, and younger clients are also technology savvy and willing to research investments in a way that previous generations have not. The medical version of this is WebMD. Talk to any doctor these days, and you&rsquo;ll find that many patients go into their surgeries with their own self-diagnosis. The doctor then has to either agree, or spend time breaking down the misdiagnosis before starting on their own. The same is happening in our world. Everyone knows that a financially educated client is a good client, but they can take more time!</li><li> Transparency is another disrupter. A flaw in the AUM charge is that, although it is beautifully simple, it does not tie directly to the value that the advisor is providing. If an advisor&rsquo;s firm is built around financial planning and life advice, there is little correlation. With regulators moving in and pushing for more fee transparency, this disconnect between value and fee becomes very evident. <br/>  </li><p> We are looking forward to engaging with anyone who is interested in this topic. After our experiences last year, we think there are a lot of you. To start the ball rolling, we are writing paired blog posts. In this one, I&rsquo;m going to lay out the case for the status quo and the ubiquitous 100 basis point AUM model. In the next post, John will push for an alternative model that will be more relevant to the new advisor landscape. I&rsquo;m not used to being the guy who argues for doing nothing, but John insisted!</p><p> <strong>  Advantages of an AUM fee model </strong> <br/> There are several advantages to the AUM model; it is no fluke that it has become the dominant way that advisors charge fees.</p><li> <strong>  Simplicity. </strong>  The AUM model is so simple. A line item goes on the client statement (which is seldom read) that uses the simplest equation possible to determine what the quarterly advisor fee is.</li><li> <strong>  Out of mind. </strong>  The fee comes directly from the client&rsquo;s account; there is no check to write. As such, the fee is out of mind. It is a well-known secret that most advisor clients have little idea of the actual amount, in dollar and cents, that they are paying to their advisor each quarter</li><li> <strong>  Equality. </strong>  In this model, everyone is treated equally. It is true that most advisors add a tiering system for their larger clients, but it is typically a consistent model. With one model across a firm&rsquo;s book of business, the client does not have to do comparisons, which may make them second-guess the whole process.</li><li> <strong>  Built-in increases. </strong>  Everyone knows that advisor fees must go up, if only to combat inflation. If the assumption is that the market over the long term always goes up, then the advisor has a built-in fee increase. This is not an event that has to be explained to the client. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  For whom does the AUM fee model work? </strong> <br/> Part of the discussion last year was: is advisor fee compression inevitable? Industry magazines and some industry pundits have certainly implied this and have fueled advisors&rsquo; fears. Therefore, you may be surprised to see the many different types of advisor for whom the AUM model makes sense.</p><p> <strong>  No advisor fee pushback. </strong>  If your client base is not pushing you to reduce fees or change your fee model, then this is not the time to be the guinea pig. As part of our research, we surveyed 775 advisors in August of 2015. One of the questions asked, &ldquo;Are you getting any pressure from your clients to reduce your fees?&rdquo; Eighty-five percent said no. It is clear that the industry is trying out new fee models, but there is a solid argument that you should let others do the experimentation and feel the inevitable pain. Jump on the fee change band wagon after it&rsquo;s been more fully tested, better known and accepted by more clients.</p><p> <strong>  Legacy AUM advisors. </strong>  Advisors who have used an AUM model for many years whose clients are used to it. Typically the firm would be monolithic&mdash;offering one branded investment service to one segment of clients. This description fits a lot of advisors. This group is often paired with the one above about not feeling pressure from a satisfied client base.</p><p> <strong>  Investment advisors. </strong>  An AUM fee makes sense for firms that have built their value around investments. There is a more direct link between your clients&rsquo; assets, their investments and the value that you provide them.</p><p> <strong>  Lifestyle advisors. </strong>  Lastly, AUM fees are probably right for the lifestyle advisor. This advisor has a good book of clients and a good lifestyle, and is not pushing to grow their client base or make any new, innovative moves with their firm. Often these are older advisors who have decided that a succession plan is not worth it. Once again, this is a large group of advisors.</p><p> <strong>  The Alternative </strong> <br/> In our next blog post, John will paint the picture of the alternative model. He will push for change and outline what some of the early adopters are doing with their fee models.</p><p> This discussion is meant to get the brain racing as we move into the holidays. We would love to hear feedback from you on what you think the pros and cons are of different fee models.

Raef&rsquo;s post did a nice job of outlining the challenges today&rsquo;s advisors face regarding fees. He and I agree that there is a lot of noise about fees today and we don&rsquo;t think it is going to stop. Some of the fee pressures for advisors are:</p><li> <strong>  The robo-advisor effect  </strong> &ndash; To me, more important is the effect of the firms that call themselves robo-advisors but are, in reality, virtual advisors offering limited planning, aggregation, risk tolerance questionnaire, asset allocation advice and cheap (i.e., passive) implementation all for about 25 basis points.</li><li> <strong>  Educated clients, validators and the investment commoditization </strong>  &ndash; As Raef suggested, we are living in a world where consumers use WebMD and Turbo Tax to educate themselves before meeting with the doctor or CPA. We also have tons of information and advice available via the internet that enables clients to validate opinions, shop for best prices and confirm costs. In fact, there are very few products that a consumer can&rsquo;t purchase without the help of an advisor. With the multitude of offerings and the ease of access, investment vehicles are becoming more commoditized every day.</li><li> <strong>  Regulation  </strong> &ndash; The upcoming DOL Fiduciary rule means how advisors get paid is only going to get more media coverage and more scrutiny in the coming weeks, months and years. Obviously, we have to wait until the rule is implemented, but to me, we are nearing the end of commission-based products (at least in qualified accounts), and advisors need to understand that advisory compensation will always be a concern of regulators. <br/>  </li><p> While Raef&rsquo;s post argued for the status quo and laid out good reasons and business models that would encourage staying put with a traditional AUM fee, I would like to argue for change.</p><p> <strong>  Fee for Advice or Something Else </strong> <br/> We start the paper with a simple yet interesting point that I have been trying to make for years:</p><p> I find it interesting that we are the only industry I know of that typically takes a highly valued asset (advice), and for the most part, gives it away for free. Yet we charge on what has become a commodity (investments). And you can get the valued asset only if you pay for the non-valued asset.</p><p> To me, the dichotomy of our business models is only going to be called in to more question as the disrupters (robo, educated/validators and regulations) evolve more into the public consciousness.</p><p> First, let me be clear&mdash;there is no right model for everyone. If there were a perfect model, we would all be implementing the same way and there would be no need for white papers or debates. What is important is that each advisor, each firm, has to develop and implement a clear value proposition that resonates with their target clients. The value proposition is foundational to who you are, who you serve and how you will charge. (We discuss the value proposition at length in the paper, so I will leave it there.)</p><p> <strong>  A Model for Change </strong> <br/> There are many options for alternative fee structures other than 100 basis points on AUM. Some advisors use hourly, others look at retainers. But for today, I want to look at a modular fee structure.</p><p> One of the more popular modular fees that we look at is the following:</p><li> Initial planning fee with annual retainer fee thereafter. (Flat fee charged in increments over the year)</li><li> A lower &ldquo;investment oversight or coordination fee&rdquo; of about 15 &ndash; 25 basis points</li><li> Other service-related fees as necessary, such as an aggregated performance fee or special projects related to the niche. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>   Advantages of a Modular Fee </strong> <br/> There are several advantages of the modular fee schedule:</p><li> The fee schedule is clearly more in line with what the client values. Study after study shows that access to advice is more valued by clients than investment advice. The modular fee schedule shows your emphasis on advice and deemphasizes focus on things an advisors has little control over (volatile markets or economy).</li><li> The modular fee schedule is fairer to the consumer (think regulators). The current model (AUM) traditionally has larger clients, where more revenue is generated, subsidizing the smaller clients, where less revenue generated, for similar if not the same services. Additionally, if clients add additional assets to their portfolios, the advisor can get a substantial revenue increase for doing essentially the same thing, causing client/advisor fee friction.</li><li> The modular fee schedule has the ability to increase the revenue for the advisor in good markets, albeit slightly, but the retainer maintains the revenue and cushions the downslide in bad markets as opposed to the all-AUM model. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Whom Does the Modular Fee Schedule Work For? </strong> <br/> Obviously this model does not work for everyone. As Raef suggested in his post, legacy AUM advisors, investment advisors and lifestyle advisors would not need or benefit from changing their fee schedules today. And for some, clients are not demanding a change today, so having the fee discussion (especially about change) can be a difficult exercise. For those advisors, &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo; So whom does it work for?</p><li> <strong>  Advisors with younger clients: </strong>  Setting up a fee schedule focused on advice will be very attractive to the HENRYs (High Earning, Not Rich Yet) clients who need advice but don&rsquo;t have the large asset pool for the traditional AUM model to work on their behalf.</li><li> <strong>  Advisors who want to test a small account solution for kids/grandkids of current clients </strong> &mdash;similar to above, it allows advisor to get paid for advice while providing service to clients</li><li> <strong>  Advisors who are concerned about future regulations and client reaction: </strong> Value is tied to specific services. Puts advisor on the moral high ground with complete transparency and focus on what the advisor can control (advice). I think the question is for many, &ldquo;Do we want to be ahead of any proposed changes or behind?&rdquo;.</li><li> <strong>  Newer advisors looking for differentiation: </strong>  New model sets the advisor apart in a crowded business. The model allows for a focus on the value proposition instead of the industry definitions of fee-based vs. commission-based&mdash;we call the new model Advice Based. <br/>  </li><p> My usual ending would be to say Raef is wrong, my way is right and that is that. But not today. In fact, there is no right answer to the business models that we discussed here or others that are referenced in the upcoming white paper. The right answer is the one that works best for you and your clients. I think we can all agree that fees are at a crossroads. Which path you decide to take is up to you. Our job is to lay out a road map for each path. We would love to hear your comments, concerns or questions.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-21 21:34:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-21 21:34:12.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisor-fees-at-a-crossroads-not-so-fast-my-friend/\", \"post_id\": \"8169\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-21 21:34:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-21 21:34:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisor-fees-at-a-crossroads-not-so-fast-my-friend\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8168\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3830\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Advisor-Fees-at-a-Crossroads-Not-So-Fast-My-Friend-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"749\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450816800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3704,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Anarchy Or Innovation? Extreme Management Policies That Kick It To The Next Level","link":"anarchy-or-innovation-extreme-management-policies-that-kick-it-to-the-next-level","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Extreme company cultures are taking over HR and thriving. Their policies have completely gone against the grain of traditional management strategies, yet innovation is flourishing and millennials are flocking to interviews. What is the secret behind these companies&rsquo; irresistible weirdness? When comparing three leading companies to the results found in  <u>  Deloitte&rsquo;s 2014 Millennial Survey </u>  we begin to see some patterns.</p><h3> 1. Zappos</h3>Zappos has put the weird in weird company culture. Tony Hsieh&rsquo;s penchant for everything llamas has led him to create his own commune in downtown Las Vegas where they roam free amongst luxury employee trailer homes. The design of the offices includes everything from jungle themes to Star Wars. How does Zappos stay weird while continuing to grow?One way is by hiring the right people. Rather than just working to attract top talent, Zappos hires for company culture fit. In fact, the company <u> <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/zappos-art-of-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  offers new hires $4000 </a></u> to leave Zappos to ensure everyone is 100% integrated into the culture. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, losing an employee due to company culture fit results in a <u> loss of 50-60% of the employee&rsquo;s salary</u>. This is a particular risk with millennials who are known for their lack of company loyalty. Even if you have the best of the best applying at your company, if they don&rsquo;t fit the culture you won&rsquo;t see the expected returns in the long run.At Zappos they&rsquo;ve also pioneered a new organizational system of self-management called<a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/holacracy-a-guide-to-giving-more-and-getting-more-from-your-team-360-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  Holacracy </u></a>. This system empowers employees with more autonomy over their work, rethinks traditional job descriptions and makes organizational structures flatter. While it&rsquo;s not a completely flat system, &ldquo;lead links&rdquo; (the closest form to a manager) only assign roles to employees and provide support. Meanwhile, employees are given space to use their own creativity and discretion to accomplish tasks.According to <u> Deloitte&rsquo;s 2014 survey</u>, 78% of Millennials want to work for a company that encourages innovation and creative thinking, yet most say they&rsquo;re not getting this at their current company. In fact, they believe the top two barriers to innovation are management (63%) and organizational structures and procedures (61%). For this reason, companies that eschew conventional hierarchies and give more freedom to employees tend to attract young independent minded talent.<h3> 2. Patagonia</h3>Created in the 70s by outdoor enthusiasts,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/a-company-that-profits-as-it-pampers-workers/2014/10/22/d3321b34-4818-11e4-b72e-d60a9229cc10_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  &ldquo;Let my people go surfing time&rdquo; </u></a> has been a standing policy at Patagonia. This policy effectively allows employees to leave the office when there&rsquo;s a perfect surf or for other outdoor activities, even during office hours. Located not too far from the beach in Ventura, California it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see managers and employees catching some waves before a big meeting or taking some time out to go rock climbing. There&rsquo;s even a daily updated surf report and a stock of Patagonia towels provided.Other than helping to refresh the mind, encouraging employees to leave the office for outdoor activities fosters a strong belief in the product they&rsquo;re selling with employees being encouraged to test out their apparel regularly. If an employee really believes in the product, it will come across to the client. Hiring environmentally conscious employees allows them to think like their clients and means they&rsquo;ll be on board with the more extreme marketing techniques Patagonia employs.Going against anything you might learn in marketing 101, Patagonia has followed extremely unorthodox marketing campaigns including its <u> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-schwab/dont-buy-this-jacket-part-two_b_5613394.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t buy this jacket&rsquo; </a></u> ad, which aimed to actually discourage people from buying new clothes during the holiday season. Another is its <u> <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/footprint.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Footprint Chronicles </a></u>, a shockingly transparent report of how their products are made. The company has also done substantial work in actual <u> <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=2410\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Patagonia </a></u> to preserve the environment. With these actions they&rsquo;re not just promoting a product but a lifestyle and set of values.The Deloitte Survey shows that millennials don&rsquo;t just want great jobs, they also want their jobs to have a social impact. According to the 2014 millennial survey, 71% believe companies should do more to address global issues, such as resource scarcity (68%), climate change (65%) and income inequality (64%).Patagonia was also one of the first companies to offer on-site<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201303/liz-welch/the-way-i-work-yvon-chouinard-patagonia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  child care facilities in 1981 </u></a>. This means that employees and their families can grow along with the company. Meanwhile, other companies risk losing experienced employees by not providing enough options for better work life balance.<h3> 3. Atlassian</h3>Business Review Weekly named Atlassian the best place to work in Australia for the past two years in a row. Perhaps the most extreme aspect of their people management policies is the (paid) time off they give to employees to devote to fun, charity and their own personal development. Even before new hires begin work they&rsquo;re given a travel voucher for a<a href=\"http://www.brw.com.au/lists/best-places-to-work/2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  &lsquo;Holiday before you start&rsquo; </u></a>. Once they&rsquo;re relaxed and ready to work employees are also given five days of<a href=\"http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/04/advancing-humanity-using-jira-foundation-runs-service-desk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  volunteer leave </u></a> a year to help out with their favorite charities.Based on FedEx&rsquo;s guarantee to ship packages in a day, Atlassian challenges their employees to devise new ideas in 24 hour <u> <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &lsquo;Shipit days&rsquo; </a></u>. During these four days a year employees are told to drop their normal work and spend time on any creative project they can come up with. The policy has produced innovative results from new product features to a mini arcade for the office. In his <u> <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TEDTalk </a></u> Dan Pink explains that more and more we are finding that economic incentives are not as effective at encouraging creativity as autonomy, using Atlassian&rsquo;s Shipit days as an example. Over fifty companies have now incorporated this strategy into their own development plan. Google calls its own version 20% time.To keep Atlassians engaged, the company has devoted a lot of attention to creating a space in which employees feel recognized and supported. One way is through their system of giving each other<a href=\"http://www.brw.com.au/lists/best-places-to-work/2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  &lsquo;Kudos&rsquo; </u></a> or handwritten cards and gifts from HR in recognition of great work. Atlassian&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/10/insights-into-why-atlassian-won-two-prestigious-hr-awards/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  MoodApp </u></a> was a Shipit day invention that allows employees to rate different aspects of the workday. The company is also now using a new web based and mobile<a href=\"https://www.impraise.com/#discover-impraise\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  solution </u></a> to encourage real-time and 360 degree feedback between employees and managers. While giving more autonomy to employees has proven to boost creativity, in order for it to be effective companies must also keep up effective methods of communication. These solutions allow colleagues, managers and executives to check in with employees and provide support without compromising their independence.According to Deloitte&rsquo;s study, much of the reason why millennials see managers as barriers to innovation is their unwillingness to take on risks and tendency to stick to familiar products and ways of doing business. They also cited lack of a formal process to encourage innovation and poor communication as barriers. In particular it revealed that, &ldquo;Only about half of Millennials feel the organization they work for encourages its people to suggest new ways of doing things or rewards them for innovative ideas.&rdquo; Atlassian&rsquo;s policies prove that risk taking in the name of creativity can show significant returns.<h3> Lessons:</h3><li> Hiring for company culture fit &ndash; some of these companies like Zappos make certain to hire people exclusively to fit their culture, others like Atlassian believe new hires can enrich their existing culture, either way creating a strong company culture is extremely important to these companies</li><li> They give their employees the freedom to manage their own work schedule and encourage creativity</li><li> They are not just selling a product but promoting values and a lifestyle</li><li> They care not just about giving employees fun perks but also about work life balance</li><li> Encouraging the use of new  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/technology/articles/pages/employee-feedback-apps.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   communication tools  </a> </u>  is key for supporting a more autonomous and innovative work style</li>Should your company start drinking the cult culture kool-aid?","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-21 21:54:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-21 21:54:56.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/anarchy-or-innovation-extreme-management-policies-that-kick-it-to-the-next-level/\", \"post_id\": \"8175\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-21 21:54:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-21 21:54:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"anarchy-or-innovation-extreme-management-policies-that-kick-it-to-the-next-level\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8174\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3833\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Anarchy-or-Innovation.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"776\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450807200,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3707,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Tools for Reengaging With Life in the New Year","link":"8-tools-for-reengaging-with-life-in-the-new-year","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What starts at work can creep in to your home life without you even being aware that it has. It&rsquo;s similar to what happens if mold suddenly shows up in your home. It&rsquo;s invisible until you see a small spot, which can then quickly spread to other areas. What you may think is just an issue between you and your boss travels home with you at night without you even being aware it happened. You never made a conscious decision to carry it home, but you couldn&rsquo;t stop it even if you wanted to. Once the disengagement disease attaches itself to your body, no matter how small it may start out being, it can spread quickly like mold.</p><p> I urge you to isolate the problem quickly so you can start working on the treatment and prevent the spread of the disease. It doesn&rsquo;t require a HAZMAT suit and a sealing off of all affected areas. What it does need is a willingness to act and not to stay stuck in the doom and gloom of your feelings.</p><p> Disengagement can cause powerful feelings of helplessness and despair that make you want to curl up in a ball and just shut out the rest of the world. It takes energy to deal with your inertia. There are things you can do to break out of this paralyzing state. So with that in mind, let&rsquo;s review the tools you&rsquo;ve easily got at your disposal to reengage with life.</p><p> <strong>  1. Exercise: </strong>  Physical movement in its various forms can be a great healer. Take a long walk and clear your head. Sign up for boxing lessons and let your aggression out on the punching bag, not your loved ones. Join friends for a friendly game of softball or basketball. Relax with a yoga class designed to reduce stress.</p><p> <strong>  2. Volunteer/Give Back: </strong>  Helping others in need offers you so much more in return. There is nothing better than seeing how your actions can positively impact others. It takes you out of your own head as you focus on someone or something else. Look around you; so many great organizations can use your help.</p><p> <strong>  3. Counseling: </strong>  Never be afraid to ask for help from others. Sometimes talking to a professional who can offer you an objective viewpoint is a great way to deal with the pain of disengagement.</p><p> <strong>  4. Spirituality:  </strong> Whatever your faith, seeking out a spiritual advisor to talk to can be a positive step. For many, their church, synagogue or mosque can be a welcome sanctuary from the stress going on in their lives. In this kind of setting you won&rsquo;t be judged but rather given a safe and confidential place to share your feelings.</p><p> <strong>  5. Family and Friends: </strong>  You want to bring people closer, not push them away when experiencing disengagement. It is actually one of the times when you need your support system the most. Let them in and open up about your feelings. If they know what you are experiencing, they can provide another safe haven for you. It&rsquo;s when you remain silent and alienate loved ones through your actions that you hurt your family the most.</p><p> <strong>  6. Hobbies: </strong>  Lose yourself in a hobby that you love. The happiness and fulfillment that you feel when you do something you love can wipe away the suffocating feelings that can be brought on by disengagement. You might even find that your hobby has the potential to create a moneymaking business down the road, providing you with an escape route from an unpleasant work environment.</p><p> <strong>  7. Travel: </strong>  Taking even a short trip can do wonders for your psyche. You don&rsquo;t need to go around the world to leave your pain behind. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be costly either; you can take a &lsquo;staycation&rsquo; right at home. If you&rsquo;ve got vacation time coming to you, then use it. It is there as a benefit to recharge your batteries. So what&rsquo;s the point of leaving it on the table? You can even consider taking a &lsquo;mental health day&rsquo; once in awhile where you do nothing at all or simply spend the day with your family.</p><p> <strong>  8. Take A Class: </strong>  Continual learning can be nourishing to your soul. Sign up at your local college for a class on a subject that interests you. Take a cooking class or make pottery. Use the endless opportunities available online that can sweep you away to another world and open up your mind to new and exciting information. It&rsquo;s all about stretching your mind and getting out of your daily routine.</p><p> There are so many tangible benefits to being personally and professionally engaged. Work can be a source of relief and creativity. If you are passionate and happy about your life it will bring you good health and happiness and ultimately more success and wealth.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-22 22:29:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-22 22:29:44.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-tools-for-reengaging-with-life-in-the-new-year/\", \"post_id\": \"8183\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-22 22:29:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-22 22:29:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-tools-for-reengaging-with-life-in-the-new-year\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8182\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3836\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-Tools-for-Reengaging-With-Life-in-the-New-Year-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"931\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450863900,"author_id":415,"chart_url":""}

Partnership is like a marriage. As in a good marriage there are many aspects to a good partnership that enrich the lives of each partner. When the relationship between them functions well it is reflected in many ways from happy employees, things getting done, satisfied customers and ultimately the level of success of the business itself. <br/>  </h3><p> Here are some of the benefits that most partners agree upon: <br/> &bull;You have someone to share the responsibility and the risk.  <br/> &bull;You have a built in sounding board. <br/> &bull;Clients and customers benefit from having more than one head at the helm. <br/> &bull; Work is shared. <br/> &bull;Someone holds you accountable.  <br/> &bull;Relationship is deep because of shared values, respect and trust.  <br/> &bull;Each cares about the welfare of the other and is there to back up or fill in when needed.  <br/> &bull;They don&rsquo;t count the hours each puts in. They do what is needed. <br/> &bull;Good partnerships are harmonious, even fun and when there are the inevitable conflicts or disagreements, because of the value placed on the relationship and the mutual goals, they are resolved in a way that is acceptable to each. Sometimes that means that one person overlooks or does the greater compromising. It is done in the spirit of &ldquo;what I get from this is worth it&rdquo;&hellip;..keeping the big picture in mind.</p><p> For all the benefits it is still far better to work as a solo rather than be matched with an ill-suited partner. The cost of a failed partnership is astronomical and can take years to recover. (Health, self-esteem, negative emotional impact, traumatic loss of business, family suffering, friends choose sides, legal costs, loss of a dream, etc) <br/> If you are a solo, you won&rsquo;t have that person to fill in for you or to share the responsibility. But you can have many of the benefits if you plan and know what you want. <br/> &bull;You can join a Master Mind group where other business people share their experience and advise you. <br/> &bull;You can arrange with a friend or family member to be the support and sounding board. Be careful with this, because when people are close to you, there will be an agenda, perhaps even hidden from themselves that may not always be in your best interest. <br/> &bull;You can meet on a regular basis with a colleague who is in a different business, and be a sounding board and advisor for each other. <br/> &bull;You can engage a Board of Advisors. Choose wisely. <br/> &bull;You can consult with your team of experts (lawyer, CPA, banker, etc) individually or as a group. <br/> &bull;You can hire a coach or include a coach on your advisory board or team of experts. <br/> Human beings are meant to have relationships. Those that are supportive and work like a well oiled wheel are invaluable. But if that doesn&rsquo;t translate for you into a great partnership&hellip;.you can enjoy the benefits of being solo and still have some of the partnership benefits as well.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-22 22:31:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-22 22:31:44.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-a-solo-entrepreneur-can-enjoy-the-benefits-of-a-business-partnership/\", \"post_id\": \"8185\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-22 22:31:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-22 22:31:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-a-solo-entrepreneur-can-enjoy-the-benefits-of-a-business-partnership\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8184\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3837\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-A-Solo-Entrepreneur-Can-Enjoy-the-Benefits-of-a-Business-Partnership-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1060\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451031300,"author_id":151,"chart_url":""}

A time to relax, spend time with our families and loved ones, and a time to re-energize ourselves for another year.Many of us want to be successful, so we set goals. Objectives. Targets.I used to do the same. Still do. But this holiday season, I'll be doing something else as well.You see, this year, I discovered a simple truth.Too much can kill you.If we want to be truly successful, we need to let go of things - not find more things to do. True success is built as much around letting go, weeding out and cutting down as it is around setting goals for ourselves.A year ago, my friend Anthony Iannarino wrote a post entitled  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/blog/2014/12/29/the-7-things-you-must-leave-behind-to-get-ahead/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  \"The 7 Things You Must Leave Behind To Get Ahead\" </a> .Following his example, here are seven destructive habits that many of us engage in (hey, I'm no saint either), that we should all collectively let go of.Right now.</p><h3> <strong>  #1. Chase after bad deals </strong></h3>Many of us spend way too much time chasing deals that aren't a great fit. Maybe they're deals that we know we can't win (but we try anyway). Maybe they're clients we know will be a headache to work with (but we try anyway). Maybe they're deals that, even if we win them, won't matter all that much (but we try anyway).Do yourself a favor: stop chasing those deals. <a href=\"/grow/sales-strategy/6-sales-prospects-you-dont-want-to-waste-your-time-with-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Identify them early on</a>, be honest with yourself, and cut them out of your pipeline.These deals are like a cancer: not only do they poison your body, but they inhibit healthy cells from growing in their place.If there's one thing I urge you to do in 2016, it's this: stop chasing bad business. According to my experience, this alone can help you free up 30% or more of your pipeline, and increase your win rate by 20% or more.<h3> <strong>  #2. Engage in mindless activity </strong></h3>We all have habits - some of these are good, but many don't contribute all that much to our results. Yet, we keep doing them simply because ... they are habits.You know what I'm talking about. It's the things that make us feel good, like we've accomplished something, but ultimately don't add anything in terms of our performance or achievement.Things like cold calling (1% ROI). Having meetings with unqualified prospects. Sending proposals to buyers who have no intention of buying from us. Spending excessive amounts of time researching prospects on social media.If you want to be successful, the next step to take is this one: stop engaging in \"busywork\" that looks good on a dashboard, but ultimately doesn't get you anywhere.<h3> <strong>  #3. Shoot first, ask \"why\" later </strong></h3>I have intellectual ADHD (or what buddhists call \"monkey mind\"). I love new ideas, and unless I'm very, very careful, I'll find myself in implementation mode faster than you can spell \"b-u-s-y\".As a result of that, I sometimes find myself committing to things too soon, and without really thinking things through. Meaning I waste a lot of time on things that I shouldn't be engaging in in the first place.Maybe I'll hear about this really cool new idea on a webinar, and find myself implementing it the very next day. Maybe I'll wake up with this really exciting new project in mind, only to spend a few days with it, and have it go nowhere.<strong> \"There are many things we could do, but only a few we should do.\"</strong>Before you decide what to take on, do yourself a favour and \"ask why\". Then, sleep on it. Then, \"ask why\" again. If it's still a good idea, and it fits with your overall goals (see #6), then go for it.<h3> <strong>  #4. Confuse activity with results </strong></h3>When I came out of corporate and started my own business, the most important lesson I learned was this: the world doesn't care how many hours you've spent. The world only cares about your results.Output. Revenue. Increases. Results.Those are the things that matter - not the amount of activity you've put in. Once you've left the safety of cubicle nation, no one cares about how hard you work - and neither should you.Don't be a fool - forget about \"working hard\". If you want to be successful, <a href=\"/grow/sales-strategy/please-stop-cold-calling-11-sales-tips-youll-need-to-succeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> work smart instead.</a>Focus on getting results, not on getting things done.<h3> <strong>  #5. Make decisions based on \"hope\", not data </strong></h3>Just because you want something, doesn't mean it's going to happen. And just because it's on a corporate presentation somewhere, doesn't make it a good idea either.On a daily basis, I see many decisions made on hope - completely ignoring the data. \"We should\". \"We have to\". \"We can't afford not to.\"Unfortunately, many RFPs are not worth your time (unless you have a distinct advantage). Many clients are happy to speak with you, but have <a href=\"https://www.membrain.com/blog/5-profiles-in-the-buying-center-you-must-know-about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> no intention of buying</a> from you. And many things you could be doing end up slowly sucking away your time without giving you anything in return.If you want to save your time, sanity and if you're truly interested in achieving results, do yourself a favour.First, set goals. Then, identify metrics. Finally, measure everything you do against those. And relentlessly weed out what's not working.<h3> <strong>  #6. Ignore the \"big picture\" </strong></h3>Many of us lead our lives like there's no tomorrow. We're always focused on today (don't take that literally - \"today\" can mean this week, this month, this quarter).But what about next year ? What about five years from now ? What about twenty years from now ?An extraordinary life is made up of a series of extraordinary days. But it doesn't happen by accident.<strong> \"People who know what they want, get what they want.\"</strong>Many of us set goals for the next year. But what is that anyway ? An arbitrary number (365) set by global convention.Do yourself a favour, and - as Stephen Covey said - start with the end in mind. Think further out. Where do you want to be in five years ? 10 ? 20 ?And ask yourself: is what you're currently doing the very best way to make that happen?<h3> <strong>  #7. Play it safe </strong></h3>You can't go to the moon on a bicycle.Yet, many of us expect that they will be able to achieve success beyond their wildest dreams by playing it safe, and taking small steps.Not so.Extraordinary success (however you choose to define that) requires sacrifice. It requires taking risk. It requires getting bloody knees, and getting beat up from time to time.If you want to go to the moon, you need to be willing to take risk. If you want to be successful, stop playing small. Stop playing it safe.Instead, create a big, bold vision for your life, and commit to it.The myth of success is that it requires massive action. It doesn't.Massive action can be the fastest way to nowhere.True success is built as much on knowing what not to do, what to drop and what to let go of as it is on taking action.Deep down, you know I'm right. You know there's (at least) one thing you should stop doing right now. One thing you should let go of. One thing you should cut from your never-ending to do list.What's that thing ? What do you commit to dropping, in order to be successful beyond measure ?","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-11-27 16:48:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-11-27 16:48:26.000000","image_url":"2016/11/article_placeholder_duQqv3i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":2,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-things-you-must-leave-behind-if-you-want-to-be-successful-2/\", \"post_id\": \"15659\", \"post_date\": \"2016-11-27 16:48:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-11-27 16:48:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-things-you-must-leave-behind-if-you-want-to-be-successful-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"15658\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"7515\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7-things-you-must-leave-behind-if-you-want-be-successful-0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1080\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"personal-development/ever-wonder-why-do-bad-things-keep-happening-me\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/09/stop-marketing-build-relationships-influencers/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"wpcf-homeslideroption\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1480330800,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3710,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Are You Giving Yourself for the Holidays?","link":"what-are-you-giving-yourself-for-the-holidays","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  Brian Gorman </u>  </p><p> <strong>  With the holiday season upon us, what gifts are you giving yourself? </strong></p><p> No, I am not talking about a new car, the getaway vacation, or that piece of expensive jewelry you have been craving. I am talking about something you so much more deserve, and that is available to you no matter what is in your bank account.</p><p> In my work with clients, both at the personal and at the organizational level, there are a number of gifts that I encourage them to give themselves. Consider this a gift list from which to choose for yourself.</p><p> Passion:  Today I was speaking with someone about my long-term engagement with photography. It will most likely never pay the bills for me. But when I pick up the camera, I am \"in the zone.\" The images that I produce receive critical acclaim; they are selected for juried exhibitions and museum collections; and they sometimes cause people to see the world around them--and even themselves--differently. I get the same feeling when I am working with people facing, and moving through, difficult change.</p><p> What are you passionate about? Where and how are you expressing that passion in your life today? If you don't know what it is, give yourself the gift of  Exploration ...discover it. If you know it, but aren't expressing it, give yourself the gift of Next Steps. Don't spend another year regretting that you haven't done what you could about whatever is really important to you.</p><p> Exploration:  Discover your passion. What is your \"why?\" What touches your heart, your soul, your very being. For some people, the answer becomes obvious quickly; for others, it requires reflection. Allow yourself that time and space. Make that a gift to yourself.</p><p> Next Steps:  If you know your passion, don't save it for retirement, or \"until things slow down.\" Even if it is something that requires a considerable investment of time, money, energy, etc., there is something that you can be doing about it now.</p><p> I recently spoke with someone whose work options are constrained by the visa that he has. It is work that he is good at, but it is very different than his passion for a more creative writing career. My encouragement was to write, to take courses at the local community college, and/or participate in weekend workshops.</p><p> Starting to build that platform now will allow you to launch more fully into the passion when circumstances allow. What is that first, or next, step that you can take to pursue your passion? It is most likely a better investment than the ring you were considering buying for yourself.</p><p> Patience:  Sometimes I hear, \"Why start now? It is so long before I can really make this work.\" That may be true. But if you wait until that \"so long\" has passed in order to get started, it will be an even longer time before you are making it work.</p><p> If making a new passion a more integral part of your life is a big change, it isn't going to happen over night. It is going to require patience. Having a clear picture of what it will be like once you have achieved it, and knowing that you are taking concrete steps to do so, will keep you motivated. Being patient with yourself and with the journey is a great gift to give yourself.</p><p> Being Human:  We are all human. We all make mistakes. We all hear things wrong. We all see things wrong. We all read things wrong. We all misinterpret things. We all make bad choices. We all take the wrong turn sometimes. Allow yourself to be human. Acknowledge what went wrong; if at all possible figure out why and learn from it. Then move on.</p><p> Love and Acceptance:  Most of us do the best we know how. Sometimes it is good enough, sometimes it is great, and sometimes no matter how hard we try, we can't pull it off. Sometimes we make great progress in what seems an impossibly short period of time; sometimes we seem to be going nowhere, sitting in neutral. At the end of the day, give yourself love and acceptance. This is where you are now; this is who you are now. Tomorrow you have the opportunity to pursue your passion, explore, take next steps, be patient, and be human all over again.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-22 22:49:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-22 22:49:45.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-are-you-giving-yourself-for-the-holidays/\", \"post_id\": \"8190\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-22 22:49:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-22 22:49:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-are-you-giving-yourself-for-the-holidays\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8186\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3840\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Things-You-Mus-Leave-Behind-If-You-Want-to-be-Successful.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"306\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450879200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3711,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Fed Awakens: A New Hike","link":"the-fed-awakens-a-new-hike","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What were you doing in June 2006?</p><p> That&rsquo;s when the Federal Reserve last raised interest rates, just a year after the last Star Wars flick hit theaters. The biggest movie at the time was Adam Sandler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Click,&rdquo; the hottest song, Shakira&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hips Don&rsquo;t Lie.&rdquo; The best-performing S&amp;P 500 Index stock for the month was C.H. Robinson Worldwide. And as for Janet Yellen, she was president of the Federal Reserve Bank&mdash;of San Francisco.</p><p> If June 2006 doesn&rsquo;t seem that long ago, consider this: Up to a third of asset managers working today have  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/14/wall-st-expects-three-more-rate-hikes-in-16-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   never experienced a rate hike professionally  </u>  . </a></p><p> On Wednesday, Chair Yellen announced that, for the first time in seven years, easy money will become slightly less easy. The target rate will be set at between 0.25 and 0.50 percent, which doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but it&rsquo;s important that the Fed ease into this cycle cautiously and gradually. Plus, this comes at a time when fellow industrialized nations and economic areas around the globe are considering further monetary easing measures.</p><h3> Effects and Possible Ramifications: Keep Calm and Invest On <br/>  </h3><p> Rising rates, of course, have a noticeable effect on mortgages, car loans and other forms of credit. Savers will finally start earning interest again.</p><p> The question on investors&rsquo; minds, though, is what effect they might have on their investments. After all, the last couple of days have been challenging for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping 1.5 percent on Friday alone. Is the Fed decision to blame?</p><p> To answer this, CLSA analyzed what happened to the U.S. dollar and stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index 60 trading days before and after the initial rate hike in past cycles and then calculated the averages. It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that, aside from rising interest rates, a multitude of unique factors&mdash;from geopolitics to economic conditions to the weather&mdash;played roles in influencing the outcomes. Nevertheless, CLSA&rsquo;s research is instructive.</p><p> The group finds that, on average, the U.S. dollar peaked 10 trading days before the rate hike, and then afterward slid lower for four to five weeks. This created an agreeable climate for gold and other precious metals and commodities, as their prices typically share an inverse relationship with the dollar.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/COMM-opportunity-for-commodities-us-dollar-average-performance-around-time-of-first-rate-hike-12182015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" U.S. Dollar Average Performance Around Time of First Rate Hike\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/COMM-opportunity-for-commodities-us-dollar-average-performance-around-time-of-first-rate-hike-12182015.png\"/> </a></p><p> As for equities, they traded up for 60 trading days following the initial rate hike, 70 percent of the time.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/COMM-sp-500-index-has-historically-risen-for-60-trading-days-following-first-rate-hike-12172015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"S&amp;P 500 Index Has Historically Risen for 60 Trading Days Following First Rate Hike\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/COMM-sp-500-index-has-historically-risen-for-60-trading-days-following-first-rate-hike-12172015.png\"/> </a></p><p> But CLSA&rsquo;s analysis looks only at possible near-term scenarios. What about the long-term?</p><p> In the past, the results were just as reassuring&mdash;most of the time. Barron&rsquo;s records S&amp;P 500 returns 250 and 500 days following the initial rate hike in six monetary tightening cycles going back to 1983. The findings suggest that the market went through an adjustment period, with average returns falling from 14 percent before the rate hike to 2.6 percent 250 days afterward. But by 500 days, returns returned to their pre-hike average of around 14 percent.</p>Equities Survived Previous Fed Rate Hikes<br/>S&amp;P 500 Index Returns Before and After Rate IncreasesPerformance Before/After Initial Rate HikeDate of Initial Hike250 Days Before250 Days After500 Days After5/2/198336.60%-1.10%12.20%12/16/198619.10%-5.90%11.20%3/29/1988-11.40%11.70%30.60%2/4/19945.30%0.60%34.10%6/30/199919.70%6.00%-10.70%6/30/200414.80%4.40%9.10%Average14.00%2.60%14.40%Past performance does not guarantee future results.<br/>Source: Barron&rsquo;s, U.S. Global Investors<p> Again, many other factors besides interest rates contributed to market behavior in each instance. And this time is especially different, as the market was given an unusually long runway, allowing it to price in the full effects of the liftoff before it finally happened.</p><p> I can&rsquo;t say whether the same trajectory will be taken this time as before, but what CLSA, Barron&rsquo;s and others have found should be encouraging news for commodities and stocks.</p><p> I should also point out that according to the presidential election cycle theory developed by market historian Yale Hirsh, markets do well in a presidential election year.</p><p> The consumer price index came out this week and, with an inflation rate of 2 percent, the 5-year Treasury yield is now negative. (The real interest rate is what you get after subtracting inflation from the 5-year government bond.) This bodes well for gold. Also, the 10-year bond yield is lower than it was six months ago.</p><h3> Investors Flee Junk Bonds and Defaulting Energy Companies, Find Comfort in Tax-Free Muni Bonds</h3><p> <br/> In 2008, the Fed trimmed rates to historically-low levels in response to the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. Most people would agree that this helped put the brakes on the U.S. slipping further into recession.</p><p> But low rates were also partially responsible for driving many investors into riskier investments over the last few years&mdash;corporate junk bonds among them&mdash;as they sought higher yields.</p><p> Junk bonds, or high-yield bonds, are known as such because they have some of the lowest ratings from agencies such as Moody&rsquo;s and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s. Because they carry a higher default risk than investment-grade bonds, they offer higher yields.</p><p> But with corporate default rates nearing 3 percent for the year, and at least one large high-yield bond fund cutting off all redemptions, investors are facing liquidity problems and learning the hard way why these equities are commonly called &ldquo;junk.&rdquo;</p><p> The week before last, it was announced that a high-yield bond fund&mdash;whose assets under management were worth $2.5 billion as recently as 2013&mdash;would be closing after suffering nearly $1 billion in outflows this year. This sent the junk bond market into panic mode, with several similar funds experiencing near-record outflows. Fears intensified when legendary investor Carl Icahn tweeted: &ldquo;Unfortunately I believe the meltdown in High Yield is just beginning.&rdquo;</p><p> To make matters worse, high-yield bonds have fallen into negative territory, giving investors little reward for the risk.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/COMM-corporate-high-yield-collapses-short-term-munis-climb-12182015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Corporate High-Yield Collapses, Short-Term Munis Climb\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/COMM-corporate-high-yield-collapses-short-term-munis-climb-12182015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Energy companies, highly leveraged since oil began to spill value in the summer of 2014, top the default list for the year. JPMorgan estimates that the industry&rsquo;s overall default rate might hit 10 percent next year.</p><p> &ldquo;Junk bonds will likely be dead money for at least several years,&rdquo; says  <a href=\"http://www.wyattresearch.com/article/junk-bonds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tony Daltorio  </u>  , </a>  writing for Wyatt Investment Research. &ldquo;Put your money elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p> But where, exactly, is &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo;?</p><p> With rates now on the rise, many investors have turned to investment-grade, short-term municipal bonds, which have seen inflows at the fastest pace since January.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/comm-us-investors-pile-into-muni-bonds-despite-rate-hike-12182015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Investors Pile into Muni Bonds Despite Rate Hike\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-18/comm-us-investors-pile-into-muni-bonds-despite-rate-hike-12182015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Savvy investors know that bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, but shorter-term munis are less sensitive to rate fluctuations than longer-term bonds. Put another way, bonds that are more sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment will have greater price fluctuations than those with less sensitivity.</p><p> &ldquo;As municipal bonds head toward the strongest returns in the U.S. fixed-income markets this year, investors say the end of near-zero interest rates will do little to knock state- and local-government debt off its stride,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-16/muni-bond-buyers-say-forget-the-fed-as-market-set-for-top-gains\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bloomberg  </a> </u>  writes.</p><p> Over the past seven years, low rates certainly contributed to one of the strongest bull markets in U.S. history. Now that easy money is coming to an end, we can expect to see more volatility. But as the CLSA and Barron&rsquo;s data show, there&rsquo;s still plenty of room for growth.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important, therefore, to stay diversified. Focus on high-quality, dividend-paying stocks; investment-grade, short-term municipal bonds; and, as always, gold&mdash;five percent in gold stocks, the other five percent in bullion.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-22 22:53:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-22 22:53:49.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-fed-awakens-a-new-hike/\", \"post_id\": \"8192\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-22 22:53:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-22 22:53:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-fed-awakens-a-new-hike\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8191\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3841\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-Fed-Awakens-A-New-Hike-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"430\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450867500,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

I will contend that it is the small doses of daily magic that most reaffirm our presence in a vast universe that is as mysterious as our imagination will allow; one that permits the presence of complexity that supersedes our comprehension.</p><p> So, how do we begin to notice this daily magic and tap into our inner earthly, personal power while reaffirming our faith in ethereal forces?</p><h3> 1. Keep a Daily Magic Journal <br/>  </h3><p> As Albert Einstein once said, \"Coincidences are God's way of remaining anonymous. Take special noitce of the unexpected circumstances that occur, each day - the unexpected call from a friend just as you were thinking of her; bumping into someone whom you have not seen in a long while; your special song coming up on the radio when you needed to hear it most; a particular blog appearing exactly when you needed to read it. If you don't write these things down, I guarantee you they will be lost quickly amongst the challenges of daily life.</p><h3> 2. Become aware of your surroundings <br/>  </h3><p> I guarantee that while you go about your daily routines, you pass by items in your environment that you barely notice. Each day notice one item that you usually pass by, yet are typically unaware. This item may not be an \"item\" at all. It could be a scent, the particular way the air brushes your cheek while you carry out a common task. </p><h3> 3. Experience music  <br/>  </h3><p> This is very different from listening to music. Try to pick up a specific instrument and attempt to listen only to that one throughout the piece. Don't do this while driving as it takes extreme focus.</p><h3> 4. Change Routes <br/>  </h3><p> Whether you are driving to work or going to an appointment, take a different route than usual. You will be amazed how this small action can open the door to an entire new world. </p><h3> 5. Begin sharing your experiences</h3><p> <br/> Write on this blog what you discover, tweet your daily magic #DailyMagic, post on Facebook. Share, share, share!</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-22 22:57:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-22 22:57:40.000000","image_url":"uploads/2019/06/definition-of-motivation.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-to-appreciate-the-little-things-and-attract-the-big-ones/\", \"post_id\": \"8194\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-22 22:57:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-22 22:57:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-to-appreciate-the-little-things-and-attract-the-big-ones\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8193\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3842\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Ways-to-Appreciate-the-Little-Things-in-Life.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1026\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/sales-strategy/definition-of-motivation\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450868400,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

If you want to improve the organization, you have to improve yourself and the organization gets pulled up with you. That is a big lesson. I cannot just expect the organization to improve if I don&rsquo;t improve myself and lift the organization, because that distance is a constant.&rdquo; &mdash;Indra Nooyi</h3>Building a great organization is about leadership. And, leadership is about you. As Indra Nooyi tells us in the above quote,&rdquo; If you want to improve the organization, you have to improve yourself&hellip;&rdquo; So, where should you start?<h3> Get clear on your values</h3>Building a great organization requires leaders and employees to embody shared values. Before you can build a culture on shared values, you better get clear on your values as a leader. What&rsquo;s important to you? Why does it matter? Once you have identified the values that you are truly committed to, you can start developing a culture around those values and building a great organization.<h3> Get your ego in check</h3>If you want to build a great organization, get your ego in check. Leadership is not about your personal glory. It&rsquo;s about achieving shared success. So, stop taking all the credit and start empowering and recognizing your employees and their contributions instead. When your employees know that their efforts are recognized and appreciated, they will give 110% towards making your organization great. So, stop thinking it&rsquo;s all about you and make sure your employees know that it&rsquo;s about them.<h3> Ask the right questions</h3>If you want a great organization you must start asking the right questions. You don&rsquo;t have all the answers; you need to tap into the knowledge and experience of your employees. You must build trusting relationships where they feel comfortable giving you honest answers. A company of &lsquo;yes&rsquo; men will never reach greatness. If you don&rsquo;t ask the question, what might you miss? Your employees are your greatest asset. Make sure you are asking for their input.<h3> Build your perseverance muscles</h3>To build a great organization you, as a leader, must build your perseverance muscles. You must learn hang on tight while you struggle to find solutions to overcoming the obstacles you will inevitably encounter. Building a great organization requires the relentless, sustained, and passionate pursuit of long-term goals. There will be frustration, confusion, and some failures. But, you must keep the big picture in mind. Remember that there are always several paths to reaching the same goal so remain flexible and persevere even when times get tough.<h3> Become part of an extraordinary team</h3>Building a great organization requires you, as a leader, to become part of an extraordinary team. You can&rsquo;t do it alone, and you can&rsquo;t do it by surrounding yourself with those who are content to be average. Create an extraordinary team. Surround yourself with those who are smarter and more talented than you. Don&rsquo;t feel threatened; feel excited about the limitless possibilities.<h3> It Starts with You</h3>What separates a great organization from an average one? It all starts with you. Get clear on your values, check your ego at the door, start asking the right questions, build your perseverance muscles, and create an extraordinary team to surround yourself with. Focus on how you can improve yourself and you will pull your organization up with you.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-07-27 17:31:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-07-27 17:31:34.000000","image_url":"2016/7/article_placeholder.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/?p=8278\", \"post_id\": \"8278\", \"post_date\": \"2016-07-27 10:31:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-07-27 17:31:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8277\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3892\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Build-a-Great-Organization-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"870\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/disclose-or-not-disclose-form-u4-question\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2015-12-28\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2016/The-Five-Factors-of-Smart-Beta-Investing.html\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451391300,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3714,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Security & Retirement Income Planning","link":"social-security-retirement-income-planning","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  One of the most important and popular \"sub-specialties\" in financial planning is \"Retirement Income Planning\". As baby boomers approach retirement many are fearful of that nagging question, \"do I have enough savings to ensure that I do not outlive my money in retirement?\". </strong> Unfortunately, many financial planners are ill prepared to do a comprehensive retirement income plan for their clients because they lack in-depth knowledge of the 2,700 rules which govern social security and the many filing strategies available to maximize benefits. <br/> <br/> For most retirees, social security will typically make up 30-60% of their income in retirement.  Therefore it is critical that individuals seek expert advice on the optimal filing strategy to maximize the value of their social security benefits as part of their overall retirement income plan. <br/> <br/> When it comes to retirement income planning strategies, American's are not as knowledgeable as they need to be. <strong>  Only 20% passed The American College's recent \"Retirement Income Literacy Quiz\". </strong> On that quiz, only 30% of people age 60-75 recognized that deferring Social Security by two years or working two years longer would have more impact on their retirement security than saving 3% more in the five years prior to retirement. The following are some tips which may help retirees with their retirement income planning. <br/> <br/> For starters, selecting the right investments is NOT your most important decision in retirement income planning. Surprised? For approximately two-thirds of retirees, more than half of their retirement income comes from Social Security! That means that for the average American, choosing when and how best to claim Social Security benefits (as well as when to retire and how to use home equity) has a much greater impact on retirement security than how to invest financial assets. <br/> <br/> Another fundamental misconception by many individuals approaching retirement is that they mistakenly believe that choosing \"when to retire\" and \"when to start Social Security benefits\" are a single decision. They don't realize that there may be enormous value in deferring the start of Social security benefits and that you can, and in many cases should, commence benefits sometime after retiring and not necessarily when you retire from your job. <br/> <br/> If you defer Social Security benefits from age 62 to 70, your benefits increase by 7-8% each year (the benefit at age 70 is 76% more than at age 62). Too few Americans know this. In the Retirement Income Literacy Survey, only 54% realized that deferred benefits increase each year up to age 70. <br/> <br/> Furthermore, Social Security is an inflation-adjusted annuity which will pay you as long as you live. Unlike probably all the other investments in your retirement portfolio, Social Security is likely the only asset which offers annual cost of living adjustments to help you keep up with inflation throughout your retirement. <br/> <br/> Certainly, unless your other retirement income assets are generating 7-8% guaranteed annual returns, it would probably be optimal to draw down from those other assets in order to defer the start of your Social Security benefits.  However, the challenge in retirement income planning for those who retire prior to receiving Social Security benefits is how best to fill the \"income gap\" until Social Security benefits commence. <br/> <br/> Some possible strategies to consider include working part-time in retirement, using other retirement assets, possibly tapping into home equity through a reverse mortgage or taking the lower of the two spouse's social security benefits first and deferring the larger of the two benefits. By deferring the larger of the two Social Security benefits you are also maximizing the Social Security survivor benefit, which is a critical consideration in retirement income planning. <br/> <br/> As is commonly seen in financial literature, the base of \"The Retirement Pyramid\" is composed of your guaranteed income sources (Social Security, pension income and annuities) and for good reason. The more guaranteed income you have in retirement the lower the risk of out living your money, which is the most common fear of most retirees. Deferring the start of Social Security benefits is generally the least expensive way, and often the optimal strategy, to acquiring more guaranteed lifetime income throughout retirement.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-22 23:05:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-22 23:05:08.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-security-retirement-income-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"8197\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-22 23:05:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-22 23:05:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-security-retirement-income-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8196\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3844\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Social-Security-Retirement-Planning-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1398\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450886400,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s bankers, the names of some no industry ballad mentions, who have done marvels where they were.</p><p> Banks who care about becoming healthy and sturdy organisations with a chance at staying competitive ask me about them. This is an amazing sign. A few weeks ago I spent the day with all the heads of HR or a major bank and they wanted to know who these superheroes were, what they were like and where to get more of them for their own organisations. What better signal of wanting to change the &ldquo;banking old guard&rdquo; we all like to moan about?</p><p> Getting to know these men may not provide a matrix, they have different backgrounds and skill sets beyond their ability to understand both business and technology intimately but there is something they all have in common above that, the fact that they have an immense amount of BB&amp;H which &ndash;evidently- stands for &ldquo;Courage, Brains and Heart&rdquo;.</p><p> I used to add &ldquo;Vision&rdquo; to that list and while it&rsquo;s majorly important to have focus and a clear picture of where to go, realistically most bankers have that, given a blank canvas, all the power and the money in the world, most (possibly non-board-level) bank executives would all paint the picture of a marvellous digital banking future in theoretical propositions giving the Challenger Banks in the UK a run for their money, but their ability to even suggest that leave alone execute it within the constraints of the mammoth incumbent bank requires BB&amp;H.</p><p> Some would argue I should mention here the Chris Gledhill&rsquo;s and Anne Boden&rsquo;s and the other names of ex bankers who have plenty of BB&amp;H since they had the courage to take the plunge, leave the bank and set up these new banks and to those critics I can only promise I&rsquo;ll revisit this in a year or two once they had the chance to prove their propositions because no one ever said this was fair and bravery was easy.</p><p> The bankers I have in mind are still inside the belly of the beast.</p><p> One of the ideas I&rsquo;ve toyed with was to get these great men to give me an interview, answer some questions so that you get to know them like I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of getting to know them over the last few years but then I realised that superheroes or not they are still all bankers so questions such as &ldquo;Have you always understood the enormity of the task before you or just fell into it?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How many times have you wanted to shake each board member individually when they glossed over your ideas and reverted to business as usual questions?&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you CEO of this bank?&rdquo; may well be better suited over a glass of wine than a pubic forum.</p><p> Some of their names you know &ndash; Michael Harte has re-built CBA then was snatched by Barclays. Michal Panowicz is the architect behind the most advanced European digital banking proposition with mBank and is building great things for Nordea now. Roberto Ferrari made a bank into a brand and if you read me before you know I need not say more in terms of how important an achievement that is.</p><p> Some other Banking Superheroes have very modest &ndash;if any- public profiles but we know internally in the industry that while they are still working at making big changes and the public hasn&rsquo;t felt them yet, they are poised to do great things. We know ING has one, Barclays has one too, DBS has a couple, Santander is lucky and has a few, and I have to confess I have a mental list of who&rsquo;s likeliest to become one in all UK banks and some of the international ones as well.</p><p> Bank CEOs and talent stakeholders should all have a list like that and be on the look out for the next BB&amp;H endowed Banking Superhero because when the time comes to replace the old banking guard and when incumbent banks will face their &ldquo;do or die&rdquo; change moment they&rsquo;ll act as sleeper cells of awesomeness and can surprise us and keep them from extinction. And that time is near.</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to lump all bankers together and hold their collective feet over the fire of how they&rsquo;ve failed us as consumers because they have, but if you meet an innovation manager with sadness in their eyes or a head of digital with worry lines etched all over their face or even the odd CxO who sighs heavily and looks longingly in the direction of the latest possible FinTech Unicorn at some Christmas party, remember they are fighting an immense battle against machines too large to describe or even comprehend and once they find their BB&amp;H mojo again, they can turn this sinking ship around so spare a hug or a pint for the next Banking Superhero this festive season.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-22 23:12:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-22 23:12:39.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_xqPhwWQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-real-fintech-unicorn-the-bbh-banker/\", \"post_id\": \"8199\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-22 23:12:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-22 23:12:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-real-fintech-unicorn-the-bbh-banker\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8198\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3845\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-Real-FinTech-Unicorn-the-BBH-Banker-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"808\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450893600,"author_id":160,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s different in many ways, not the least of which is the growing levels of diversity that we&rsquo;re seeing across all geographies and in all industries. But, the workplace is different in other ways as well. No longer does &ldquo;work&rdquo; mean a 9 to 5 grind in an office populated by a cadre of your peers. For many, today&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;going to work&rdquo; is quite different. In fact, increasingly, the &ldquo;workplace&rdquo; may no longer represent a physical, tangible location&mdash;but a concept. <br/>  </h3><p> Technology has vastly opened up opportunities for employees to telecommute to do their jobs, or to attend meetings literally around the world, through Skype and other video/phone conferencing tools. Freelancers and contractors are also becoming a large part of the workplace, working remotely from home, or from other locations and, only on occasion, if at all, popping into the office to connect with colleagues.  </p><p> In Eric Davis&rsquo; article &ldquo; <u>  Diversity, Creativity, and the Nontraditional Workforce </u> ,&rdquo; he cites a study conducted by the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp). They interviewed a combination of 80 business leaders and found that, while the interviewees thought nontraditional workplaces could have both positive and negative effects on an organization&rsquo;s culture, &ldquo;95 percent of those interviewed reported they are already using nontraditional skilled workers, and they are anticipating using more in the coming years.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, nontraditional work arrangements aren&rsquo;t in the near future&mdash;they&rsquo;re already here. While these arrangements can have negative impacts and challenge the ability of leaders to successfully communicate with, and include, all staff, inclusive leaders can successfully navigate these new interactions. Inclusive leaders can commit to involving all employees, whether they are physically present in the office environment or working remotely.</p><p> Collaboration is key. Ensuring that all member of yours staff&mdash;and particularly senior leaders&mdash;understand the value and importance of collaboration (both internally and externally), and that they have the resources and skills to collaborate effectively, will help to ensure your success in an increasingly virtual business environment.   </p><p> Inclusive leaders must also look at how they can prepare themselves for managing employees who aren&rsquo;t all located in the same place, or working at the same time. How will you hold staff meetings? Will you hold meetings with remote employees separately from your in-house employees? Making sure everyone is kept informed, and engaged, has always been important.

{"original_id":3717,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"On Becoming a Strong Leader","link":"on-becoming-a-strong-leader","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  What are some of the key questions that you might have about becoming a leader - or just about leadership, in general? </strong> <br/> <br/> Two weeks ago, I was honored to be featured alongside other leadership experts on Mashable's #BizChats Twitter chat about  leadership and on how to become a strong leader. The conversation was inspiring and fast moving, as these chats often go. <br/> <br/> The questions asked during the chat include... with a few of my thoughts woven in... <br/> <br/> <strong>  Q1. What are some defining traits of a leader? </strong> <br/> A leader doesn't tell her team what to do; instead, she inspires them to use what's already inside to do great things. She supports and uplifts her team. She's honest, transparent, has a great attitude, communicates well, is always learning, empowers others, and does the right thing. One thing to remember is that a leader doesn't necessarily have a team but must have followers. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Q2. What are some common mistakes that new leaders make? </strong> <br/> Some common mistakes I've seen include:</p><li> Believing they have to have the answer or all the answers </li><li> Talking more, listening less</li><li> Thinking you have to do everything; it's ok to delegate</li><li> Not working well with others</li><li> Trying to do things themselves, on their own, in isolation</li><p> <br/> <strong>  Q3. How can a leader take on more ownership without becoming overwhelmed? </strong> <br/> They can delegate and then empower their followers. They'll still be accountable, but it's OK to pass on responsibility to the team. Also, leaders don't have to take on more ownership; they ought to inspire and guide and teach - and give up some ownership. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Q4. What are some useful tips for leaders managing a team for the first time? </strong> <br/> A few of the tips I offered up include:</p><li> You don't have to have all the answers</li><li> You don't have to be the sage on the stage; be the guide by your team's side</li><li> Give credit where credit is due; don't take credit for your team's work</li><li> But when your team fails, you're the first to fall on the sword</li><li> Recognize your employees for a job well done</li><li> Take care of your team, really care about them</li><li> Think about a leader in your past: To be like them or to not be like them? That is the question.</li><p> <br/> <strong>  Q5. What steps should a leader take when dealing with office politics and/or conflicts? </strong> <br/> Recognize that there is conflict; discuss what it is and what it means for the team. Understand the opposing positions, and figure out how you'll work together. Don't let things get personal, and don't take things personally. Communicate early and often. And in the end, don't forget patience and respect.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Q6. How does emotional intelligence play into effective leadership? </strong> <br/> When you understand how your emotions affect others, when you have this emotional awareness, you can better control your reactions. It then keeps you from attacking others, allows you to feel empathy, and allows you to resolve conflict more effectively and diplomatically. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Q7. What are some myths about leadership? </strong> <br/> A couple of common myths (there are so many more) include:</p><li> You have to have a team to be a leader</li><li> Managers and leaders are one and the same</li><li> Leaders have all the answers</li><li> Leaders can't ask for help</li><p> <br/> <strong>  Q8. What final tips do you have into evolving into a leader? </strong> <br/> A few of my tips included:</p><li> Don't be afraid to speak your mind, and when you do, be prepared for what you hear</li><li> Inspire, don't tell or yell</li><li> You are in charge of your destiny and the type of leader you will become</li><li> Think of past leaders and pull lessons from the good ones and swear off traits from the bad ones! <br/>  </li><p> To see the full wrap-up of the chat, check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/12/03/leadership-skills-workplace/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mashable's write-up  </a> </u>  on it or the  <u>  Storify version </u> . <br/> <br/> Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other. -John F.

Nor is it the paper in your wallet.</p><h3> In actuality money is a unit of measurement.</h3><p> <br/> Just as a kilogram represents a unit of measurement for mass, or a mile represents a unit to measure distance, money is a vastly important measure of economic value.</p><p> This idea of measuring economic value was something passed down from the ancient Greeks thousands of years ago.</p><p> They minted coins to define units of measurement for economic value, and they developed the concept of the marketplace as a way for the public to fairly and efficiently determine the economic value of a particular good or service.</p><p> There was no more guesswork; the value of a quart of olives, or a single sheep, could be quickly assessed and easily communicated across an entire society.</p><p> And this idea of measuring economic value became just as important to the development of civilization as standard measurements for mass and length.</p><p> It would be next to impossible for a team of carpenters to build a house or bridge without first agreeing on standards of measurement.</p><p> If I defined distance based on the width of my thumb, and you defined it using the length of your cat, we&rsquo;d hardly be able to communicate professionally.</p><p> Similarly, we could never expect the modern economy to develop and flourish without first agreeing how to measure economic value.</p><p> And this is what&rsquo;s so terribly wrong with our modern financial system.</p><p> We have ceded control of this definition of economic value to an unelected committee of bureaucrats.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve long been critical of this, and I&rsquo;m convinced that if benevolent space aliens visited our planet, they would be utterly bewildered at our financial system.</p><p> Now, in fairness, the same thing has happened with other units of measurement.</p><p> The International Bureau for Weights and Measures has given us a very clear definition for a meter and kilogram.</p><h3> But it&rsquo;s different with money.</h3><p> <br/> In the United States, for example, the Mint and Coinage Act of 1792 very precisely defined the unit of economic value in America: 371.25 grains of pure silver.</p><p> And this definition lasted from the birth of the nation all the way up through it becoming the largest economy in the world.</p><p> But today it is no longer the same. The dollars you have in your pocket have nothing to do with silver anymore.</p><p> Americans&rsquo; standard measurement of economic value is now exclusively controlled by the Federal Reserve. And they are not shy about changing it.</p><p> Yesterday the Fed unsurprisingly announced that they were going to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</p><p> In doing so, they have effectively changed the value of money and hence adjusted the unit of measurement for economic value.</p><p> Strangely, the Fed views this as one of its missions; they openly acknowledge that they strive for an annual inflation rate of 2%.</p><p> 2% might not sound like much, but over the course of time it really adds up. It means that within a single lifetime, your unit of economic value will be reduced by more than 75%.</p><p> Just imagine if a committee of unelected bureaucrats periodically made significant changes to the value of a gallon.</p><p> Or if their stated goal was to reduce the value of a kilometer by 2% per year.</p><p> It would be utterly ridiculous, affecting the lives of just about everyone. Some would be better off, some would be worse off.</p><p> Taxi drivers, for example, would make a lot more money at the expense of their passengers if the value of a kilometer were debased.</p><p> The distance between Point A and Point B would increase when expressed in kilometers, so you&rsquo;d be paying more every time you jumped in an Uber.</p><p> Similarly, shipping companies would make more money at the expense of producers who have to transport their products.</p><p> Money is no exception. Whenever central bankers adjust the unit of measurement for economic value, there are winners and losers.</p><p> Banks and governments tend to do very well when their friends at the central bank manipulate the value of money.</p><p> And as you can imagine, the average guy on the street is not the winner.</p><p> So it&rsquo;s no surprise that the middle class in the Land of the Free is no longer the largest segment of the population, according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/09/the-american-middle-class-is-losing-ground/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent report by Pew Research  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Or that more than 50% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.</h3><p> <br/> Or that the birthrate in the Land of the Free is nearing an all-time low, due in large part to the rising costs of having a child.</p><p> That&rsquo;s our financial system. It&rsquo;s is based on unaccountable, unelected committees deciding who wins, and who loses.</p><p> And they&rsquo;ve decided that you&rsquo;re going to be a loser.</p><p> Once you understand this simple truth, you have a very important choice to make: let them continue to determine your economic future, or take charge of it yourself.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 15:43:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 15:43:03.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_e7Er5Mb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-is-how-i-would-explain-the-feds-rate-hike-to-a-space-alien/\", \"post_id\": \"8204\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 15:43:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 15:43:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-is-how-i-would-explain-the-feds-rate-hike-to-a-space-alien\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8203\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3849\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/This-is-How-I-Would-Explain-the-Feds-Rate-Hike-to-a-Space-Alien-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"840\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450953900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3719,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Key Lessons in Cross Border Wealth Management – American Ex-Pat","link":"key-lessons-in-cross-border-wealth-management-american-ex-pat","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As part of our article series on issues in Cross Border Wealth Management, the following is an illustration of some of the key implementation strategies we come across in helping cross border professionals manage their complex financial affairs.</p><h3> &ldquo;Our financial affairs are so complicated because we have stuff all over the world, and no one has ever looked at our whole picture,&rdquo; worried the client when we first sat down with them.</h3><p> <br/> This client is an American living in Hong Kong for many years. He is originally from New York, and was working in Germany when he met his wife, a German citizen. He has since been posted in numerous countries with his long-time employer, and now finds himself running the Asia region from Hong Kong. The client has three children, who are all dual national citizens of the U.S. and Germany. The wife is not a U.S. citizen.</p><p> The clients have accumulated a significant net worth of well over $5m over the years, with three properties owned in three different countries (two are now rentals) and a significant amount of financial assets in company stock and options, qualified savings accounts in multiple countries, accumulated cash and diversified liquid investments.</p><p> In the time that we have worked with this client, we successfully guided them through many unique planning decisions, including the following:</p><li> <strong>  Oversight of U.S.-based investment accounts, which include qualified accounts and 529 plans. </strong> The 529 plans were an interesting discussion, because it is uncertain whether the kids will be attending university in Europe or in the U.S. Higher education in Europe is often free or at least substantially less expensive than in the States. This of course could lead to a situation where a large 529 balance could go unutilized, thus incurring a tax penalty. In the end, we agreed that it was very likely that at least one of their kids would study in the U.S., making a 529 plan make sense.</li><li> <strong>  In-depth involvement in tax planning in conjunction with their various tax advisors, as they have moved among four countries during our time working together. </strong> Over the years, we have sought out multiple new tax advisors to join their advisory team, based on their evolving tax situation.</li><li> <strong>  Helped identify an inappropriate offshore investment, which was later liquidated. </strong> This particular investment was sold to the American citizen client before he married his German wife. These off-shore investment &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; have long been sold to non-American expats, but for an American the structure never made any sense. Furthermore, most of these that we have reviewed are also quite poorly performing investments in their own right, due to excessive fees and poor investment results.</li><li> <strong>  Organized the various foreign qualified accounts they own, and helped to evaluate the investment choices and reallocate holdings. </strong> Careful consideration of their employer pension in Hong Kong resulted in their decision to decline participation for tax reasons.</li><li> <strong>  We&rsquo;ve consulted on employer compensation negotiations, in particular reviewing cost of living allowances and the currency adjusted, net after-tax take home pay of two competing job opportunities. </strong> This directly led to a significantly higher final salary, as we were able to help him show his employer that their initial offer was not competitive after considering the tax effects.</li><li> <strong>  Helped analyze the wife&rsquo;s German property holdings, which were gifted to her as a result of her parents&rsquo; estate planning. </strong> She owns the property with her sibling, but does not have any legal right to the income until her mother passes away. This created some confusion regarding proper taxation.</li><li> <strong>  Helped them find a suitable estate planning attorney to prepare a will and other estate planning documents tailored to their situation. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> &ldquo;Finally we found someone who understood the unique situation we are in given our international background,&rdquo; noted the client. </p><p> If you as an advisor have any questions about cross-border financial planning and wealth management approaches, please feel free to contact us!</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 15:48:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 15:48:51.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_pUAbBFJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/key-lessons-in-cross-border-wealth-management-american-ex-pat/\", \"post_id\": \"8206\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 15:48:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 15:48:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"key-lessons-in-cross-border-wealth-management-american-ex-pat\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8205\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3850\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Key-Lessons-in-Cross-Border-Wealth-Management-American-Ex-Pat-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"850\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450972800,"author_id":31,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3720,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Say No to Fear - Stay Clear of Fear","link":"say-no-to-fear-stay-clear-of-fear","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As we are approaching this holiday season and the end of 2015, we should all remember that fear (while sometimes a force to propel us forward), can keep us from being successful. I decided to include a photo of my granddaughter, who is quite fearless. At the young age of not quite three, she doesn't apply thought patterns from the past, she just moves ahead like every day is anew, holding her handbag with confidence and vigor.</p><p> Reflecting on 2015 I would like to share some best practices and observations we have been so fortunate to experience, hoping that we will continue our journey together into a successful 2016.</p><p> During my trip to my hometown Vienna before Thanksgiving I experienced the attacks in Paris on European territory and it reminded me that being safe is a privilege.</p><p> What struck me was that Europeans seemed to remain rather calm after all the events, trying to maintain normalcy, going about life in defiance of the fear terrorists planned to instill. Even in Vienna, where John Kerry was meeting for the Syrian peace talks, there was hardly any visible presence of police, allowing the pre Xmas spirit to shine through. Fear is not the answer to any situation, having a sound plan and the freedom to play it out is.</p><h3> Sometimes we are afraid of Success <br/>  </h3><p> Sales people always need to appear confident and upbeat, but they face challenges and problems, just like everybody else. Often, the outgoing facade hides some insecurities and often the result is more activity rather than applying a sound strategy. For a sales person to be successful it is important to understand the fear of failure this profession brings with it. Being afraid of success is something fairly common in the business world (or on a personal level) but in a sales environment it's a lot more transparent and easier to detect. The effects are also a lot more drastic, because so many sales people depend on successfully closing business to literally earn a living.</p><p> Sales people are measured by numbers and if we don't put numbers on the books it puts enormous pressure on us. Fear is not always an obstacle; it can also be a driver as long as we don't become frantic in our attempts to make things happen. There is nothing more annoying or aggravating than an over-eager sales person. Once we become desperate, sound strategy usually goes out the window.  <br/> <br/> The best remedy is to develop a long-term and short term SMART objectives and to stick with them (and adjust to them if necessary). It will help with anxiety and it will also make for better business decisions.</p><h3> Avoid Panic <br/>  </h3><p> While we are talking about fear, we should also talk about panic, which is usually a result of fear. Panic often sets in when sales don't happen. Then situations happen, for example when CEOs take over sales training, or attend sales calls and start micro-managing everything and anything that has to do with sales. <br/> <br/> They fear for their company&rsquo;s survival and that's understandable. Fear is contagious and once the CEO panics, it often affects sales management and it can have a snowball effect on the sales team. Then sales people might fear that they could lose their job or that they won't be making any money. <br/> <br/> Then sales managers do both. They panic and fear, both for their team, for their compensation and for their reputation. <br/> <br/> The best recipe is to stay calm and on-track. Again, if there is a plan in place, success will follow. Sometimes, it's good to review the plan and maybe adjust it a bit, but to throw out the plan altogether once things don't happen immediately is a poor choice and it can lead to disastrous results. In a consultative sales environment, planning is an absolute essential.</p><h3> Embrace Rejection <br/>  </h3><p> The best sales people are those who know that \"no\" is the second best answer. Rejection is part of our daily life and embracing it helps us understand our target audience better. In our many years of searching and observing sales professionals, we have seen far too many sales people chase good conversations rather than closing a sale. <br/> <br/> We like to refer to those sales people as \"professional visitors\", because they thrive on making connections and not on getting to the next step. The goal of every interaction in sales is to get one step closer to a sale, not to have better chats.  <br/> <br/> The best sales people are the ones who invite a \"no thanks\" to gauge a potential fit. There is no point in chasing after a prospect who is not a good fit. Finding out sooner rather than later that you can&rsquo;t provide prospect real value gives you the freedom and time to move on to a better opportunity.</p><h3> People Buy from People <br/>  </h3><p> That's really the bottom line. More and more articles, posts and blogs are about the fact that it's still people who are involved in the decision making process. <br/> <br/> Remember the old adage? Know &ndash; Like &ndash; Trust. Never forget that it is people you are targeting. Make your messages stand out. Personalize your emails, don't mass market. Do research on the people you target so you can have meaningful conversations with them. Remember, that everybody has a personal life and sometimes things can go wrong, so be mindful of others.</p><h3> A Lesson from my Dog <br/> <br/> <br/>  </h3><p> My dog Rhondo (who we rescued 6 years ago) teaches me lessons every day. While he is super focused on getting food and attention, he is also mindful, compassionate and very often more considerate than some sales people I encounter.  <br/> <br/> Unlike many sales people who call on me, Rhondo hardly ever interrupts my work day because he intuitively feels when I have time to play or when I am focused on something else. It's the way I move and the way I sound that provides hints to my dog. (Intuitive behavioral adjusting) <br/> <br/> My dog is in my office with me every single day. He never barks, never even makes a sound. He lies on the office couch (yes, he is spoiled!) and it is not until I put my headphones back into the holder, making a gentle click, signaling to him that I might be ready for a break. That's when he starts moving. But it's not until I get up and tell him that we are leaving the office that he actually leaves the couch to follow me.  <br/> Following gentle hints from our prospects, understanding when to talk and when to listen, identifying behavioral and communication styles and just simply paying attention can be a good recipe to making your contacts feel comfortable and to building trust. And you we all know, trust is essential when it comes to building solid, long-standing business relationships.</p>In this spirit, let's stick with our plan (and if you don't have one, this is the best time to develop a strategy) and focus on the positive. There is always something to be grateful for. <br/><strong> Happy Holidays!!</strong>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 19:30:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 19:30:49.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_XZDRYzY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/say-no-to-fear-stay-clear-of-fear/\", \"post_id\": \"8208\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 19:30:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 19:30:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"say-no-to-fear-stay-clear-of-fear\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8207\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3851\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Say-No-To-Fear-Stay-Clear-of-Fear-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"673\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450980000,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3721,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Top Secrets of Persuasion","link":"7-top-secrets-of-persuasion","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> FBI counterintelligence agents, such as myself, recruit foreign spies to work for the U.S. government. It&rsquo;s not that we are selling anything; instead, we are using persuasion to make our point. Very often, we are successful. <br/>  </h3><p> You may never find yourself in a situation where you&rsquo;ll be confronted with a Russian spy trying to steal classified information, and chances are even slimmer that you&rsquo;ll be asked to recruit him to work for our side, but there will be times that you will absolutely need to make your point. </p><p> Persuasion is not just for spies, salespeople, and teenagers.</p><p> As entrepreneurs and business owners, you may need to persuade an investor to take a closer look at your proposal, get assistance at work, or persuade employees to perform better. The truth is, we&rsquo;re all negotiators.</p><p> I took FBI hostage negotiation training at Quantico, and the first thing I learned is that persuasion techniques not only work with barricaded criminals wielding assault rifles&mdash;they apply to any form of disagreement or any situation where you need someone else to see your point of view.</p><p> Persuasion is about far more than argument and counter-argument. </p><p> Here are 7 top secrets of persuasion and tips on how to counter them:</p><h3> 1. Be Bold And Assertive <br/>  </h3><p> Humans equate confidence with skill. If you come across as confident, even the most cynical person will be at least partly persuaded.</p><p> The key is to stop using qualifiers like &ldquo;I think&rdquo; or &ldquo;I believe.&rdquo; Instead, if you think something will work, just say it.</p><p> Let your enthusiasm and confidence show through and people will be more likely to be persuaded.</p><p> <strong>  DEFENSE TIPS for you: </strong></p><p> Resistance is easiest when we feel sharp and alert. That is when we&rsquo;re in a better position to raise a counter-argument, maintain our position, and spot persuasion attempts coming our way.</p><h3> 2. Inoculation Slowly Bleeds You Dry <br/>  </h3><p> Medical inoculations work by giving you a little of the disease so that your body can prepare itself for attack in the future.</p><p> Psychological inoculation works the same way. </p><p> Propose an idea that takes on a new angle that people haven&rsquo;t thought of before. Then, introduce an alternative approach or solution that is a bit closer to their way of thinking. Chances are very good that people will jump at the alternative, even though it would have been immediately dismissed if introduced before the first one.</p><p> This is how ex-spouses, hostage negotiators, and politicians extort us everyday with persuasive arguments. In the end, we grab the alternative and think we&rsquo;ve struck a good deal.</p><p> <strong>  DEFENSE TIPS for you: </strong></p><p> Expose yourself to different types of arguments and positions you will likely come across. When you know what&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s easier to psychologically prepare yourself. Be wary of the same old argument presented in a slightly different way.</p><h3> 3. Come Across As An Expert With Authority <br/>  </h3><p> Make sure your credentials are solid. Research has shown that we defer to those who appear to have authority. If you don&rsquo;t have the heft to make a persuasive argument, align yourself with someone who does.</p><p> People don&rsquo;t often second guess or question someone who makes a recommendation if they believe the individual is either an expert or someone with authority.</p><p> <strong>  DEFENSE TIPS for you: </strong></p><p> Be extremely wary of anyone who relies entirely on authority to influence you.</p><h3> 4. Validate What The Other Person Says <br/>  </h3><p> This may sound counterintuitive, but if you don&rsquo;t let the other party have their say, you can talk until you&rsquo;re blue in the face and they will not have heard a word you said. Instead of listening to you, they were forming their own counter-argument in the mind.</p><p> The best way to quiet the voice in the other person&rsquo;s head is to hear the other side out and then make your argument.</p><p> <strong>  DEFENSE TIPS for you: </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t ask open-ended questions after they&rsquo;ve made their argument. Open-ended questions invite more discussion, whereas you want to close it down. Ask questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no.</p><h3> 5. Mirror Both Behavior and Words <br/>  </h3><p> A lot of research has been conducted on the effectiveness of mirroring a person&rsquo;s behavior to create rapport. We smile when others smile, lean in when they do, and give the impression of sharing a secret understanding that is personal and makes us appear more likable. </p><p> Effective coaches, therapists, and hostage negotiators simply repeat the last word that was spoken by the other person. It indicates that they are listening and engaged.</p><p> <strong>  DEFENSE TIPS for you: </strong></p><p> Think about whether the persuasion attempt is trying to maneuver you to do something that you wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily be interested in doing. Try to dissociate the speaker with the message they are conveying.</p><h3> 6. Adapt To The Personality Of The Other Person <br/>  </h3><p> An essential element of mental toughness is the ability to accurately read the emotions of others and then adapt your behavior accordingly.</p><p> Match your personality to your boss, employee, or client. Assess whether they are introverts or extraverts, analytical or a visionary, purpose-driven or security-driven, goal-oriented or people-oriented. </p><p> If you&rsquo;ve been a good listener, you will be able to make these distinctions.</p><p> <strong>  DEFENSE TIPS for you: </strong></p><p> Determine whether the person is sincere or just trying to please you by saying things they assume you want to hear.</p><h3> 7. Add Charm To The Conversation <br/>  </h3><p> My years in the FBI were a grueling course in learning good manners because people were not going to talk to me, let alone follow me, unless I could engage them in a way that was meaningful and productive.</p><p> Demonstrate warmth first when connecting with others, develop a bond and then be competent in the work you do together.</p><p> It&rsquo;s much easier to change people&rsquo;s minds if you take the time to develop more than shallow, fleeting relationships with them. It comes down to this: in a world of mass media you must learn how to charm people if you want to persuade them to take your point of view seriously.</p><p> <strong>  DEFENSE TIPS for you: </strong></p><p> We are more easily swayed than we realize. Be wary of all attempts to camouflage a persuasive message.</p><p> What ways have you found to be the most persuasive?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 19:42:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 19:42:20.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_oPuzvAL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-top-secrets-of-persuasion/\", \"post_id\": \"8210\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 19:42:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 19:42:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-top-secrets-of-persuasion\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8209\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3852\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Top-Secrets-Of-Persuasion.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"1\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"563\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451127600,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3722,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"‘Am I Saving Enough?' Here's How to Tell","link":"am-i-saving-enough-heres-how-to-tell","source_link":null,"content":"<p> During our first meeting, a 55-year-old couple asked, &ldquo;How do you think we&rsquo;re doing for people our age? Are we saving enough?&rdquo;This is a good question, one I&rsquo;m often asked. People want to know how they measure up.They hope to hear that they are doing better than most. In their minds, this means things are moving in the right direction. But &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2015/01/08/financially-fit-cities-where-keeping-up-with-these-joneses-is-a-good-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">   keeping up with the Joneses  </a> </u> &rdquo; has never been a bankable strategy. So we need to dig deeper to determine what the question is really about.For the couple I was meeting with, what they were really asking was whether it would be possible for them to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/retirement-calculator/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   retire  </a> </u>  early based on their current savings. But for a young couple just having kids, the same question is likely to center on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/pay-college-havent-saved-enough/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   saving for college  </a> </u>  or moving into a bigger  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/guides/buying-a-home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   house  </a> </u> .People ultimately want to know if they will have enough money to do the things  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/spending-time-enjoy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   they still hope to do  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Digging deeper</h3>To begin answering this question for yourself, you first need to know the type of life you want to live. You must understand how much you are spending versus how much you are earning. But determining your spending needs is a tough nut to crack.That&rsquo;s because spending decisions are heavily influenced by quality-of-life considerations. Some people hire house cleaners and lawn services, while others prefer doing it themselves. Eating nice meals out frequently may be the spice of life for you, but others enjoy cooking at home.Decisions on the bigger-ticket items have the greatest impact. A large house will require a larger down payment, meaning less liquid savings. Some people aspire to drive nicer cars for short periods, while others want to drive cars until the wheels fall off. Then there&rsquo;s that <u> <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3136260/245340-usda-cost-of-raising-a-child-having-baby-245000-304480-department-of-agriculture/\" target=\"_blank\">  little decision about having kids </a></u>, which will have more than a slight impact on your financial trajectory.Acknowledging the things you consider important to your quality of life can give you a great blueprint for the amount it will take to sustain that life.<h3> Struggling to save</h3>While some who ask &ldquo;Am I saving enough?&rdquo; are seeking validation, others are worried that they haven&rsquo;t saved enough.Recent research finds that 68% of people believe they&rsquo;ve saved too little &mdash; but <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/takeaways-morningstar-investor-conference/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  only 3% </u>  </a>are actually following through by saving more. This isn&rsquo;t surprising. It&rsquo;s the same disconnect you find in all endeavors that require consistent action. We can all get charged up on a jolt of motivation, but when it&rsquo;s time to implement, we freeze.Thoughts bubble up about the big trips we want to take this summer, or that luxury car we&rsquo;ve always wanted (and deserve). We start thinking about putting more money into our <u> <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/category/investing/401k/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  401(k) </a></u>, and we realize we need to limit our current spending to make it work. Then it doesn&rsquo;t sound like such a good idea.This is when what seems simple in theory (saving more) becomes hard. Making choices that change our quality of life now is more painful than we originally thought and often results in inaction.<h3> The answer</h3>The only way to know if you are saving enough is to piece together your financial puzzle.Take inventory of what you&rsquo;ve saved and how much you anticipate you can still save. Set up automatic transfers of money from checking to savings &mdash; but watch the credit card bills. Automating savings while accumulating credit card debt is counterproductive.Working with a qualified advisor can make an enormous difference. Studies have shown the effect that good advice can produce. Often, this advice helps prevent you from ratcheting up your lifestyle too quickly in the first place.Some questions have easy answers. Unfortunately, &ldquo;Have I saved enough?&rdquo; is not one of them. With successful financial planning, you can find your answer &mdash; and if it&rsquo;s no, you can devise a way to get to yes.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 19:45:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 19:45:59.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_C6JVh3F.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/am-i-saving-enough-heres-how-to-tell/\", \"post_id\": \"8211\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 19:45:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 19:45:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"am-i-saving-enough-heres-how-to-tell\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8209\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3853\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Top-Secrets-Of-Persuasion.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"469\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450950300,"author_id":100,"chart_url":""}

Alternatives for a Comfortable Retirement","link":"dont-want-to-sell-your-house-alternatives-for-a-comfortable-retirement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One option you can consider to free up some much-needed cash to fund a comfortable retirement is to sell your house. This can make good financial sense on paper, but the decision is not as simple as simply contacting real estate agent and putting a sign on the lawn.</p><p> Your home holds many memories of times spent with loved ones. If you are thinking of selling the place where you raised your family or lived with a beloved spouse who has passed on, it can be very difficult to move on.</p><p> There is more than one solution to this issue, though. Before you make any decision, consider you options carefully to take into account your short and long-term financial needs.</p><h3> Alternatives for a Comfortable Retirement When you Don&rsquo;t Want to Sell your House <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Take out a Reverse Mortgage </strong></p><p> Many older Canadians have seen the value of their homes increase significantly over the years, and taking out a reverse mortgage is a way to access some of the equity while retaining ownership and control of the property. This type of plan is available to Canadians aged 55 and older.</p><p> You can choose to access the money either as a lump sum or in installment payments which will give you a regular income. These plans are flexible enough that you can choose a payment option which includes an initial advance to pay off debt or make necessary repairs and that will continue to give you the cash you need over a longer term. No payments are required until you decide to sell the house or you die. To determine whether this makes sense to you, it&rsquo;s a good idea to discuss your situation with a financial planner who can point out the advantages and disadvantages of this option for your personal situation.</p><p> <strong>  Share Your Home with Your Children </strong></p><p> The cost of buying a home is moving out of reach for many young families, or it is taking them much longer to save the money required for a down payment while paying for child care and other expenses. Consider having an adult child and their family come to live with you.</p><p> By pooling your resources, everyone could benefit from this type of arrangement. Your adult child can save on the cost of childcare if you are willing and able to care for your grandchildren and you can discuss getting some help with paying for the cost of running the household instead of paying rent.</p><p> <strong>  Create Income by Adding an Apartment </strong></p><p> If you have a basement with a separate entrance, you may be able to turn that space into some cash by renovating it into a legal apartment. You will need to check the zoning for your neighborhood, but this can be a way to generate some much-needed income.

{"original_id":3724,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seeking to Reduce Fiduciary Responsibility?","link":"seeking-to-reduce-fiduciary-responsibility","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve talked with many company decision-makers (fiduciaries) who felt that their advisor, record-keeper or provider had fiduciary responsibility for their plan. Jerome Schlichter, attorney for the largest awards for 401(k) class action lawsuits sues the employer. Recently, he won a case against Chicago area Boeing Corporation. Think it only happens to the big guys? Google &ldquo;Department of Labor, EBSA, enforcement.&rdquo; The Department of Labor&rsquo;s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the private employee benefit plan system in the United States under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.</p><p> Often when there's something that we want to believe we tend not to do further investigation. If you make the decision on what broker to use, what record-keeper (often a bundled service provider) and custodian how can you not be responsible?</p><h3> Limiting certain fiduciary liabilities <br/>  </h3><p> The law allows a couple of safe harbors to help limit certain liabilities. The longest standing has been 404(c). The following excerpt is from the Department of Labor publication titled Meeting Your Fiduciary Responsibilities: &ldquo;Some plans&hellip; can be set up to give the participants control over the investments in their accounts and limit a fiduciary&rsquo;s liability for the investment decisions made by the participants.&rdquo; It is a list of things you can do such as providing proper disclosures. Employers that comply with 404(c) can shift responsibility for investment decisions to plan participants. In short, 404(c) offers a &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; for plan fiduciaries to not be liable for investment losses suffered by plan participants who self-direct their investments. This means that employers won&rsquo;t be liable for their employees&rsquo; investment mistakes.</p><p> To qualify for this safe harbor, plan sponsors must comply with the requirements for investment selection, plan administration, and plan &amp; investment disclosures before they obtain relief from fiduciary liability for losses plan participants incur as a result of their directing their own investments. 1</p><p> You may unknowingly be opting for the safe harbor relief or mistakenly believe you qualify. I have found many decision-makers that are unaware that they have filed for 404(c) relief. It is an election made on your tax return. One CFO shared with me that he was just filling out what his predecessor had done.</p><p> Another safe harbor is the use of a qualified default investment alternative (QDIA). The target date strategy has become a default choice by many brokers and plan providers. However, you may not qualify for relief at all! The Department of Labor who offers the relief says that you must properly select and monitor that choice. All target date strategies (or the other QDIA choices of lifestyle or balanced strategies are not created equal. Have you checked to see if your employees are getting better returns than before you opted for the QDIA? Is your QDIA selection based on an investment policy statement? If using a target date strategy, do you consider the difference between a to retirement or through retirement style when evaluating your choice? If not, your election may not qualify. This is not an all-inclusive list of considerations.</p><h3> Sharing the fiduciary responsibility <br/>  </h3><p> If you don&rsquo;t have the background and fiduciary investing, I recommend that you find professional investment fiduciaries that will share in seeing that you are running the plan with the best interests of your employees in mind. Why take on risks where there is little or no return I believe your first hire should be someone that has broad knowledge of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act that is at least an Accredited Investment Fiduciary. That person should also sign on to be an ERISA 3(21) investment advisor. This person can explain your options for hiring additional fiduciaries.</p><p> If you or your investment committee aren&rsquo;t CERTIFEID FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; professional, Chartered Financial Analysts how well could you defend your investment decisions? Are you willing to spend the time to get that level of knowledge?  Imagine transferring fiduciary responsibility for investment decisions to a fiduciary, discretionary investment manager? Could you better use that time handling the core functions of your business?</p><p> Please don&rsquo;t jump on the first firm that says that they can be a discretionary investment manager. You need to show a Department of Labor investigator that you went through a prudent process. Like an investment, everyone isn&rsquo;t the same. You don&rsquo;t want to pick a lemon when you were trying to manage risk. Be wary of the term consultant. Some consultants are fiduciaries while others may simply work for a well-known brand name which you assume has expertise and would stand behind their consultants.</p><h3> Transferring some fiduciary responsibility <br/>  </h3><p> While you can&rsquo;t get rid of all the risk, you can transfer some fiduciary responsibility. W. Scott Simon, Morningstar Columnist and author of The Prudent Investor Act: A Guide to Understanding says you may significantly reduce risk when you properly pick and manage an ERISA 3(38) investment manager. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to give you and your employees the benefit of investment expertise rather than investment hope and a prayer.</p><p> The stakes are simply too high not to address potential fiduciary risks.

{"original_id":3725,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Staying Out of Debt During Holiday Spending","link":"staying-out-of-debt-during-holiday-spending","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Are you ready for the holiday rush and buying spree? Traditionally, the holidays bring us a time of sharing and giving. But the cost of giving has increased over the years and you need to be aware of the burden it could put on your financial situation. With the change in most individual&rsquo;s financial situation over the past year, this is a good time to reevaluate your holiday gift giving.</p><p> Most families spend around $500 on holiday gifts. If you put all those gifts on your credit card, the end result may surprise you. Do you have any idea how long you will be paying off those holiday gifts if you can only make the minimum payment each month? Let&rsquo;s do some math:</p><p> <strong>  $500 of holiday gifts: </strong>  Let&rsquo;s say you charge $500 on your credit card and only make the minimum monthly payment of $20. Some credit cards now are around the 19.99% interest rate for long period payoffs, you will be paying on those holiday gifts for 3 years! And to top it off, you will be paying the credit card company an additional $153 in interest (see Bank Rate website &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/credit-cards/credit-card-payoff-calculator.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.bankrate.com/calculators/credit-cards/credit-card-payoff-calculator.aspx  </a> </u> ).</p><p> <strong>  What if your gifts top the $1000 mark: </strong>  Now you have an after-the-holidays credit card bill starting at $1000, with the same $20 of minimum monthly payment and 19.99% interest rate. Are you sitting down? It will take you 9 years to pay off those gifts you purchased! The credit card company will be happy because you will pay them $1,167 in interest. Yes, that is correct you will be giving $1000 worth of holiday gifts to your friends and family, plus over time more than a $1000 gift to your credit card company.</p><p> Not to be a Scrooge, but there is a downside to credit card use if you can not pay it off in a month or two. Another option is the cash envelope and gift list method. Make a list of people you will be buying for, a dollar amount for each person and some great gift ideas you know they will love. Now hit the mall with list and cash envelope in hand. Your goal is not to purchase more than you have in your envelope.</p><p> <strong>  A last tip to remember: </strong> the holidays are not always about the purchased gifts. Think back on all the unwanted, unneeded or forgotten gifts you have received over the years. If you were able to have something different from the giver, what would it have been?  What were the best holiday gifts you have received? Was it the homemade cookies, the framed children&rsquo;s art work or just being able to spend time with your family and friends? The holidays are truly about sharing and giving; think about using your heart and mind instead of your credit card. Have a Happy and Financially Safe holiday!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 19:57:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 19:57:59.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_entAp1M.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/staying-out-of-debt-during-holiday-spending/\", \"post_id\": \"8215\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 19:57:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 19:57:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"staying-out-of-debt-during-holiday-spending\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8214\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3856\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Staying-Out-of-Debt-During-Holiday-Spending-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"657\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450947600,"author_id":282,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3726,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"So You Want to Deliver Outstanding Customer Experiences… | Driven to Delight","link":"so-you-want-to-deliver-outstanding-customer-experiences-driven-to-delight","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to Forrester Research, 93% of corporate leadership teams place customer experience improvement on their list of strategic priorities and 23% businesses have it in the number 1 position.  So if you want to drive an elevated customer experience that differentiates your business from the competition, increases the loyalty of your customers, and results in more referrals,  <strong>  you are certainly not alone! </strong> Since so many leaders see &ldquo;customer experience&rdquo; enhancement as critical to business success, it logically follows that customers must be delighted by all the extra effort companies are putting behind their high-priority customer-focused initiatives, right?Well, not exactly. Actually, not at all. In fact, the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is reporting customer satisfaction levels that are hovering just above 9 year lows.In the poem  Rime of the Ancient Mariner , Samuel Taylor Coleridge laments, &ldquo;Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.&rdquo; In the modern business world this could be updated to read, &ldquo;Customer experience priorities everywhere, but ne&rsquo;er a delighted customer.&rdquo;While this situation isn&rsquo;t great for customers, it represents a fabulous opportunity for those who are truly committed to customer experience excellence.  So how do you not only satisfy your customers, but actually delight them?  Here&rsquo;s an example from Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) &ndash; the focus of my recent book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.d2dbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Driven to Delight: Delivering World-Class Customer Experience the Mercedes-Benz Way  </a> </u> .It should be noted that the Mercedes-Benz brand promise is &ldquo;best or nothing&rdquo; and by most accounts, their vehicles, as well as their marketing efforts, deliver on that promise.  However, the dealership experience in the United States (how do I put this delicately) &hellip;.was less than the &ldquo;best.&rdquo;  In fact, as recently as 2012, Mercedes-Benz USA was in the number 6 position on the J D Power Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) among luxury car manufacturers.   As such, like those 23% in the Forrester Research study, leaders at MBUSA catapulted customer experience improvement to be their #1 priority.  By 2014, Mercedes-Benz USA had risen to the top of the J D. Power SSI and was either the leader or had made substantial progress on internal and external metrics of customer satisfaction, loyalty and engagement.  So what did leaders at Mercedes-Benz do that might help you with your customer experience elevation?  Here are some highlights&hellip; <strong>  Think Multi-year </strong>  &ndash; As Henry Hynekamp, general manager, Customer Experience, at Mercedes-Benz USA, notes, &ldquo;Customer experience transformation is hard and it doesn&rsquo;t spontaneously combust in an organization.  It takes disciplined and sustained focus.&rdquo;  The difference between &lsquo;wannabes&rsquo; and customer experience leaders often is sustained execution and a willingness to invest time and resources year-after-year. <strong>  Define Your Desired Experience </strong>  &ndash; I&rsquo;m continually surprised by how few organizations actually have a defined optimal customer experience.  I spend considerable time as a consultant helping leaders articulate the experience they want customers to have at key touch points throughout the customer journey.  This involves leaders coming together to determine operational and emotional aspects of their desired and branded customer experience. <strong>  Focus on Three Drivers </strong>  &ndash;  Mercedes-Benz USA has a &ldquo;war room&rdquo; with initiatives plastered around the walls.  Those projects fall into three categories: people, process, and technology. Each area offers different benefits to customers.  Mobilizing your people creates the warmth and compassion of your brand experience.  Process improvement removes pain points and technology often makes the customer journey easier.  The advanced challenge is helping customers move back and forth seamlessly from technology to human service.For more on how to  <strong>  not just &ldquo;prioritize&rdquo; </strong>  customer excellence but actually  <strong>  deliver it </strong> , I hope you&rsquo;ll consider checking out  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.d2dbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Driven to Delight: Delivering World-Class Customer Experience the Mercedes-Benz Way  </a> </u> . <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/19.png \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"So you want to deliver outstanding info\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/19.png \"/> </a></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 20:03:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 20:03:21.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_jCcFxjg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/so-you-want-to-deliver-outstanding-customer-experiences-driven-to-delight/\", \"post_id\": \"8217\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 20:03:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 20:03:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"so-you-want-to-deliver-outstanding-customer-experiences-driven-to-delight\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8216\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3857\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/So-You-Want-to-Deliver-Outstanding-Customer-Experiences...jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1002\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450965600,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

The holiday season is in full swing, and jolly ol' Saint Nick is tirelessly plugging away getting toys ready for all the good boys and girls on his list (and collecting all those coal chunks for those not-so-good kiddos).</p><p> What does it take to be known far and wide as the bringer of happiness and joy to children worldwide? How about some top-notch leadership skills. Lets check out what it takes to really get down to business like Santa Clause:</p><h3> 1. Spots top talent from within <br/>  </h3><p> We all know Rudolph saved the day on that one foggy Christmas Eve. But who spotted his unusual skill set and made sure he was working on his sled-leading talents all year round? Santa, that's who. Santa knows that it takes a wide variety of talent and skills to achieve ambitious goals &mdash; that's why he's not scared of bringing on diverse reindeer to broaden out the team. </p><h3> 2. Keeps a positive attitude <br/>  </h3><p> He's not called Jolly Ol' Saint Nick for nothing. Santa Claus has the kind of personality and attitude that keeps the team going strong, even in the hardest of times. You can bet those last few days before Christmas mean crunch time around the workshop, but the elves get it done thanks to Santa Claus' positive, can-do attitude. </p><h3> 3. Creates a top-notch culture</h3><p> <br/> Let's face it, the North Pole isn't exactly HQ catnip. It's not just cold, it's frozen all over. Yet somehow Santa manages to recruit of team of elves and other helpers that help him get the job down flawlessly. How does he pull it off? By creating a world-class culture that helps push the constant snow drifts and frozen tundras to the back of everyone's minds.</p><h3> 4. Focuses on the workshop's competitive advantages <br/>  </h3><p> After centuries of building a top-notch workshop that can build and deliver toys to children worldwide, you can bet Santa is an operations mastermind. He's built the right team, the right production lines, and has cornered the niche on toy-making for good boys and girls. You don't see him trying to get into fast food, branded paraphanelia, or the latest fad. He knows what the workshop is good at and he's focused on keeping his eye on the ball. </p><h3> 5. Has the right tool to do the job <br/>  </h3><p> How does Santa pull off delivering toys across the world in just one night? With magical sleighs and a toy bag and expands to accomodate all the fun gifts and trinkets. Santa knows you can only meet expectations when you're equipped with all the right resources. </p> ","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 20:19:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 20:19:15.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_bMFlkiG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-enduring-leadership-qualities-from-santa-claus/\", \"post_id\": \"8221\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 20:19:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 20:19:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-enduring-leadership-qualities-from-santa-claus\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8220\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3859\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Enduring-Leadership-Qualities-From-Santa-Claus-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1072\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451028600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3729,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Reasons to Be Thankful for Social Media This Holiday Season","link":"five-reasons-to-be-thankful-for-social-media-this-holiday-season","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to get annoyed with social media, and yes, I&rsquo;m guilty of being irritable with the constant interaction and/or notifications.</p><p> But the truth is that if we step back, social media is a blessing in MANY way.</p><p> It gives us multiple channels to keep in touch, locate old friends, and hey &ndash; it&rsquo;s full of cute kitties and sweet puppies, which everyone needs more of in life.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t you dare roll your eyes!</p><p> There&rsquo;s plenty who say that social media ruins our life, hurts our relationships, and destroys our self-esteem.</p><p> But there&rsquo;s so many ways that social media makes our lives better, especially during the holiday season, and I want to share them with you.</p><p> Why? Because we should focus on the positive effects of social media, and see all the ways it helps us to do things we&rsquo;ve never done simply by logging onto Facebook or Instagram.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s walk through 5 reasons to be thankful for social media this holiday season.</p><h3> 1. Social media makes it easy to connect with loved ones. <br/>  </h3><p> Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; how easy is it for grandma to log on and see the latest pictures of her grandchildren? Or talk with your gypsy of a friend living across the world? Or plan holidays events with online invitations &ndash; all the while saving trees and being kind to the environment?</p><p> Super easy with social media!</p><p> I remember the days when I had to be home when someone was going to call me, when staying in touch meant swiping my tongue across lots of stamps (ew!), and when I didn&rsquo;t know how long it would be before I was able to see family members again.</p><p> And yes, I&rsquo;m showing my age.</p><p> But still.. You remember it, too!</p><p> And while there are fond things I miss like handwritten notes, letters in the mail, and that concern I won&rsquo;t be home when someone cute is going to call me. But.</p><p> Times have changed, and that is exciting because it offers us more opportunities to connect with loved ones over the holidays, regardless of where they are, what they&rsquo;re doing, and loveeee all over them.</p><h3> 2. Social media makes it simple to let your fans, followers, and customers know how much they mean to you. <br/>  </h3><p> Back in the day, it was pretty tough to let ALL your customers or clients know how important they are to you.</p><p> Maybe it was because you didn&rsquo;t have everyone&rsquo;s address or weren&rsquo;t able to pinpoint every person who appreciated your products or service.</p><p> But these days, you can share how thankful you are for your customers and online audiences easily and often.</p><p> You can put together quote cards, photos or videos, and get as personal as you want.</p><p> However, if you only do it once, it will be tough to reach everyone, so use the holidays as an opportunity to be overly thankful and say it as much as possible. And from every angle.</p><p> Send out email newsletters, write a blog, tweet it, update your Facebook, share pics on Instagram, videos on Snapchat, or put together a Periscope or Blab that you can share again and again.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a luxury to be able to thank everyone so effortlessly, but we must not take advantage of that.</p><h3> 3. Social media allows us to spread love and positive messages to those who may not get to hear it during the holidays. <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever served in a soup kitchen or volunteered on a holiday, you&rsquo;re more than aware there are thousands of people out there who don&rsquo;t have anyone to share the holidays with, and it can be a hard time for them.</p><p> That&rsquo;s where you and social media can make a positive impact!</p><p> Not only do you want to thank the people who support you online, but take the time to do so because there&rsquo;s many out there who won&rsquo;t hear it from other people.</p><p> The holidays can be a rough time, so spread as much cheer as you possible can! Go overboard!</p><p> Utilize your social networks to share heartwarming content, useful articles, fun videos, and as much ooey-gooey goodness as you can possibly muster.</p><h3> 4. Social media allows us to easily find fun things to do locally. <br/>  </h3><p> If you haven&rsquo;t tapped into the power of social media for finding awesome things to do during the holiday season, then you&rsquo;re missing out!</p><p> Last week, I came across a Facebook update explaining the candle lighting ceremonies in downtown Wilmington (where I recently moved to), so I was able to join in.</p><p> In fact, I&rsquo;ve done nothing but use social media to tap into the local scene since I moved here for restaurants, events, grocery stores, yoga studios, and places to run.</p><p> Search your social channels for local listings, events, and be sure to support local businesses as much as you can during the holiday season.</p><p> Especially if you&rsquo;re alone or have recently moved, jumping on social can provide ample opportunities to find events you wouldn&rsquo;t never found out about.</p><p> And the same goes for locals! You never know what you&rsquo;ll find until you start looking.</p><h3> 5. Social media reminds us that while it&rsquo;s easy to stay connected, what really matters is in front of us. <br/>  </h3><p> And finally, while social media is awesome, and provides us ample channels to communicate easily with loved ones from every walk of life, it&rsquo;s a reminder that life doesn&rsquo;t exist online.</p><p> The holidays are for family and friends, not being glued to our phones, laptops, or tablets.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the time to put these things aside and enjoy the tender moments, the ones we&rsquo;ll miss one day or call memories.</p><p> So take lots of pictures, but don&rsquo;t get stuck behind the camera.</p><p> Shoot videos of funny or endearing moments, but make sure there&rsquo;s a purpose behind them.</p><p> And don&rsquo;t feel the need to updated everyone and their Mom about every single little thing that makes your holiday wonderful.</p><p> Enjoy it.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 20:24:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 20:24:51.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_NPelp6g.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-reasons-to-be-thankful-for-social-media-this-holiday-season/\", \"post_id\": \"8222\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 20:24:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 20:24:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-reasons-to-be-thankful-for-social-media-this-holiday-season\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8223\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3860\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Reasons-to-Be-Thankful-for-Social-Media-This-Holiday-Season-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"724\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450983600,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3730,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Considerations When Setting Company Resolutions","link":"five-considerations-when-setting-company-resolutions","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A new year provides a great opportunity for a fresh start. However, it&rsquo;s critical to begin with more than &lsquo;good intentions.&rsquo; Not unlike personal New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, it&rsquo;s one thing to set company resolutions &ndash; resolutions which, if achieved, will make a sustained positive impact &ndash; and quite another to stay the course until success is achieved. <br/>  </h3><p> On a personal basis, per a 2015 University of Scranton study, only eight percent of individuals achieve the goals they set. I suspect company resolution success rates aren&rsquo;t much higher. Success requires sustained behavior change and creating new habits aligned with company goals.</p><p> <strong>  Consider the following when setting 2016 resolutions: </strong></p><h3> <strong>  Process </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Resolution Success Factors</h3><p> The low rate of success in achieving resolutions points to the need for considerable dedication and a positive reinforcement structure. Success factors include:</p><li> A &ldquo;champion&rdquo; who leads from start to finish</li><li> A team approach with defined individual accountabilities</li><li> Clear definitions of each resolution and what makes its success important to the company</li><li> A realistic roadmap with checkpoints and interim goals</li><li> Making sometimes uncomfortable changes, with enough commitment to embrace changes until they become habits</li><li> Clear enduring benefits to the company &ndash; and optimally a majority of employees</li><h3> <br/> 2. Determine Worthy Resolutions</h3><p> Begin with an annual year-end evaluation with your leadership team. Set the tone and personally demonstrate that openly discussing past successes and failures has the sole goal of identifying resolutions with the greatest positive company impact. <br/> <br/> Optimal resolutions will 1) further key company performance objectives, and 2) solidify and enhance company culture &ndash; making your company a more desirable place to work, and an attractive company highly talented individuals will want to join.</p><h3> <strong>  Company Attributes </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 3. Reap the Value of Being A &ldquo;People First&rdquo; Organization</h3><p> Leaders often publicly state, &ldquo;People are our organization&rsquo;s greatest asset.&rdquo; However, far fewer actually practice that belief. Make 2016 the year company leaders daily &lsquo;walk the talk&rsquo; of a &ldquo;People First&rdquo; organization. <br/> Your employees will reward you for it.</p><h3> 4. Be A Company Talented Individuals Seek to Work For</h3><p> There are a relatively small number of companies that publicly share their values and principles. These companies have a reputation of &ldquo;doing the right thing&rdquo; when others might have made &lsquo;easier to stomach&rsquo; choices, or done nothing at all.</p><h3> Not surprisingly, employees want to work for these companies.</h3><p> <br/> Leading an open and transparent organization doesn&rsquo;t come naturally to many business people. It goes completely against the &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; mantra of a siloed organization where information isn&rsquo;t shared readily across the organization &ndash; much less outside the organization.</p><p> However, an atmosphere of frequent communication &ndash;including both achievements and challenges &ndash; helps employees feel &lsquo;part of the team&rsquo;, provides opportunities for collaboration and sharing, and improves understanding of factors driving change.</p><p> External transparency is welcome in virtually every industry. Gaining customer trust involves consistency in words and actions taken. As well, customer trust may take years to develop &ndash; and in today&rsquo;s social-media driven world literally minutes to lose.</p><h3> 5. Lead daily according to established company values and principles &ndash; without fail.</h3><p> Perhaps the most significant &ndash; and achievable &ndash; &lsquo;company resolution&rsquo; is for leadership to set an example by making all daily decisions &ndash; even very tough ones &ndash; consistently adhering to company values and principles.</p><p> Leading daily operations in this manner results in pride among leaders and employees, and creates an industry reputation contributing to enduring success through strong customer relationships, talented future employees and respect on a broad scale.</p><h3> <strong>  Action Items: </strong></h3><p> <br/> The year-end evaluation has substantial potential if resolutions reflect key company priorities that will create positive momentum toward important changes going into the new year.</p><li> <strong>  Ensure the session date and allotted time is scheduled well in advance to reinforce its importance. </strong> Suggest (and personally model) keeping notes throughout the year on what is working well and what could be improved.</li><li> <strong>  Ask each individual on your leadership team to come prepared for the year-end evaluation armed with the top 3 &ndash; 5 successes and 3 &ndash; 5 failures or missed opportunities. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Begin the session with a clear outline of the objectives, and ask each individual to be thinking about where they can provide the best leadership in championing a resolution. </strong> You and your leadership team will need to champion resolutions.</li><li> <strong>  Set the number of company resolutions high enough to include all core business functions and most employees </strong> , yet low enough that focus on a given resolution to make and sustain the necessary changes is not diminished.</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-23 20:28:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-23 20:28:23.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_GtiYo7t.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-considerations-when-setting-company-resolutions/\", \"post_id\": \"8225\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-23 20:28:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-23 20:28:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-considerations-when-setting-company-resolutions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8224\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3861\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Five-Considerations-When-Setting-Company-Resolutions-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"583\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450947600,"author_id":464,"chart_url":""}

ElderHelp is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping seniors stay in their homes, and the note said that a donation was given in our name from Cindi Hill of <a href=\"http://www.hilladvisors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Hill Compliance Advisors  </u> </a> , our compliance consultant. As someone who spends a large portion of my time seeking out innovative solutions to help my clients retire on their own terms, this was a particularly thoughtful gift.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re still looking for the perfect gift for someone who doesn&rsquo;t need any more &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; (or, like me, is on a diet and certainly doesn&rsquo;t want any food STUFF!), giving to their favorite charity may be just what you&rsquo;re looking for. Of course, gifting can take many forms, and many are also tax deductible, which can give the ability to be even more generous than you might think.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  </a> </u>  clearly understands the value of a tax-deductible charitable donation. If you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to the news at all, you&rsquo;ve surely heard his announcement that he and his wife Priscilla Chan made a promise to their newborn daughter to give away 99% of their Facebook wealth &ldquo;to advance human potential and promote equality.&rdquo; And while some have criticized the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chanzuckerberginitiative/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  </a> </u>  for its tax-deductible status, what many fail to realize is that the tax benefits won&rsquo;t simply put more money back in Zuckerberg&rsquo;s pocket. Zuckerberg and his wife have been very careful about how they are donating assets, creating an LLC to maintain a great deal of control over how the gifted assets are used. Theirs is a great example of a well designed charitable giving strategy that truly becomes &ldquo;the gift that keeps on giving.&rdquo;</p><p> Sure, most of us (I can safely say none of us!) don&rsquo;t have that level of expendable assets to gift, but there are many ways to support your favorite charities this holiday season while also achieving year-end tax benefits. I know my own inbox is overflowing with year-end appeals from charities I know and love, as well as many that are new to me. Whatever you choose, keep good records and remember that all donations must be made by December 31 to be eligible for 2015 tax credits. Following Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s lead, it&rsquo;s a great time to take control of your money by directing it to the charities that mean the most to you instead of giving it to Uncle Sam.</p><h3> Clearly there&rsquo;s not much time to plan, but here are a few options to consider: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Set up a Donor-Advised Fund.  </strong> These philanthropic funds give you a current-year tax deduction while making thoughtful, intentional gifts in subsequent years. Since many smaller nonprofits aren&rsquo;t set up to receive gifts of stock or other complex holdings, this is a great option if you&rsquo;re donating non-cash assets. Plus, by giving to a donor-advised fund, you avoid capital gains tax. Your contribution is treated as a gift to a 501(c)(3)public charity, and you are allowed to deduct up to 50% of your adjusted gross income for cash gifts, and 30% for appreciated securities. If you&rsquo;re interested in this option, we can help, but call us immediately to be sure we can get everything in place by year-end.</li><li> <strong>  Look for charities on   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    www.charitynavigator.org   </a>  </u>  . </strong> If you&rsquo;re not sure where to give&mdash;or are worried about your money going to a less-than-reputable organization&mdash;the site rate&rsquo;s charities by financial health, accountability, and transparency, and you can easily browse charities by categories such as human services, environment, education, animals, arts &amp; culture, public policy, and more. All charities listed qualify for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. If you do choose to give, be sure to tell you advisor and your CPA to ensure proper tax crediting.</li><li> <strong>  Donate from your IRA using a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD). </strong> If your IRA is overfunded, not only are you in an enviable position, but year-end legislation finally made QCDs from IRAs permanent (in the past, the rules came and went, making it a gamble to take this approach in hopes of a tax benefit). Donations are limited to $100,000 of tax-deferred IRA savings annually, and offer a significant advantage over taking a taxable IRA distribution and then contributing the proceeds to charity, as QCDs are not included in adjusted gross income.</li><li> <strong>  Donate household items.  </strong> If  <u>  <a href=\"https://kleinadvisors.com/resources/entry/it-s-that-time-of-year-change-is-on-the-horizon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my last blog  </a> </u>  inspired you to declutter,  <u>  <a href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/12/26/what-is-boxing-day/\" target=\"_blank\">   Boxing Day  </a> </u>  (the day after Christmas) is a great time to box up items and send them off to new homes via  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodwill.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Goodwill  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Salvation Army  </a> </u> , the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pickupplease.org/schedule-ppc?gclid=CKDB7cis8MkCFQdafgodtxIOIQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vietnam Veterans of America  </a> </u>  (who will usually pick up items at your door within 24 hours). Clearing out your pantry and making a donation to your local food bank is another great option (we give to  <a href=\"http://feedoc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Second Harvest </a> ). Whatevercharity you choose, be sure to save your receipts for tax time. <br/>  </li><p> Of course, if you&rsquo;re just looking to give and tax benefits aren&rsquo;t a priority, there are always great causes to be found on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   GoFundMe  </a> </u> &mdash;helping families in need due to death, injury, or other personal tragedies; supporting individual volunteers, natural disaster recovery, and more. All told, Americans make 30% of our annual donations in December. <strong>  I hope you&rsquo;ll take part in the &ldquo;season for gifting,&rdquo; however you choose to give. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-24 16:00:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-24 16:00:15.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_jZDv2RY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/tis-the-season-for-gifting/\", \"post_id\": \"8227\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-24 16:00:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-24 16:00:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"tis-the-season-for-gifting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8226\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3862\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tis-the-Season-for-Gifting.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"958\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1450988100,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3732,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Zuckerberg","link":"zuckerberg","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> You may have read that Facebook founder, chairman, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to gift substantially all of his Facebook stock to a philanthropic company called the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, named after himself and his wife Priscilla Chan.</h3><p> <br/> The gift would be made by the end of his lifetime, which, since Zuckerberg is 31, gives him a long time to dispose of his shares. He is limited by the SEC to not selling or giving away annually more than $1 billion in Facebook shares over the next three years. Zuckerberg says in his Facebook posting that he will \"continue to serve as Facebook&rsquo;s CEO for many, many years to come.\" This would indicate he probably intends on keeping enough of a majority in the company to maintain control for a long time.</p><p> If the company maintains its current pricing (it is currently worth $45 billion), this gift could become one of the largest philanthropic pools in the world. According to his <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chanzuckerberginitiative/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook page  </a> </u> , the purpose of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will focus on \"personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities.\"</p><p> Zuckerberg set up a limited liability company (LLC) to receive the shares rather than a charitable trust or foundation. This gives him much more control over how the money is spent than he would have over a traditional charity. Unlike a charity, the Initiative will be able to invest in for-profit companies, fund PACs, and hire lobbyists.</p><p> While giving his shares to an LLC rather than a charity will give Zuckerberg a lot more freedom in how he spends the money, his gift is not completely tax-efficient. I have read a number of accusations that setting up the LLC is simply a tax dodge and a way for Zuckerberg to avoid paying capital gains, estate and income taxes on his wealth. He contends that he and his wife would get no tax benefit from the gift and \"Just like everyone else, we will pay capital gains taxes when our shares are sold by the LLC.\"</p><p> I am not clear on all the potential tax benefits of this arrangement, of course. I do know that, had Zuckerberg decided to give his shares to a charity, similar to the gifts made by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, he would receive a charitable contribution deduction on Schedule A of his Form 1040. The amount of the deduction would be based on the fair market value of the shares. That would shelter billions of dollars of future dividend income, when and if Facebook ever pays a dividend. At the same time, he would completely avoid having to pay capital gains taxes on the appreciation of those shares.</p><p> Of course, there is a price to pay for all the tax benefits of such a gift: the donor no longer owns his shares. That value is wiped out of his net worth.</p><p> Zuckerberg appears to be damned by some either way he goes. It appears to me he wants to use his money to support causes he believes in. Had he decided not to set up the philanthropic company, he could still donate to any cause he wants, taking any resulting tax breaks and paying any resulting taxes. Whatever tax savings he may incur just means there is more money available to support those causes.</p><p> This time of year, many people donate to charities. Taking tax deductions for those gifts certainly does not taint or reduce their generosity. The intention of <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/Eight-Tips-for-Deducting-Charitable-Contributions\" target=\"_blank\">   tax breaks  </a> </u> on charitable donations is to encourage giving, as well as to allow charities to receive a bigger pool of money.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-27 16:16:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-27 16:16:14.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_OSiMIh8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/zuckerberg/\", \"post_id\": \"8229\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-27 16:16:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-27 16:16:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"zuckerberg\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8228\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3864\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Zuckerberg-Chan-Gift.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"408\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451309400,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Because reps often equate the implied interest of a call in to being &ldquo;qualified,&rdquo; they often skip some important steps.  This can happen to all sales reps and even happened to me recently&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> A CEO called me the other day and wanted to know more about the kind of training I offered.  Before I gave him my menu of services, I did what I teach and asked him how he found me, what motivated him to reach out to me, what he was looking for, etc. </p><p> I listened carefully as he revealed, in a candid way, what was happening with his inside sales team and what he as hoping to accomplish. </p><p> After he was done, I went over how I could help him and carefully matched up my customized solutions to each of the points he brought up.  After a pause, he told me he would think about it and reach back out to me.</p><p> Now, this is usually the time that I would qualify and close, but I was on vacation when this call took place and was more interested in getting back to the museum tour I was on than I was on closing the deal (I know, shame on me).

Women are not looking for perfection. They are looking for advisors who are sincere and authentic.</h3><p> <br/> Here are 4 important ways to succeed with female clients:</p><h3> Listen with heart</h3><p> <br/> Women want you to listen to them. There&rsquo;s no pretending here. Either you really listen to clients and focus on them or you don&rsquo;t. There is little point in asking questions only to continue on your &ldquo;canned&rdquo; spiel.</p><p> You may be used to seeing your client as &ldquo;just&rdquo; another investor, but women are far more than just investors. Most likely they would describe themselves as many things ahead of being an investor. You have to be sensitive to that.</p><p> To keep your female clients and/or attract women, you need to take the time and make an authentic effort to learn about them and build a relationship so you can respond with financial advice that makes sense for her.</p><h3> Speak her language</h3><p> <br/> A recent article sited research in which male and female participants were asked to create a collage of their investment goals using images. The women produced pictures of family, beaches, life experiences and aspirational views. The men showed things like hot cars, graphs and dollar signs.</p><p> That alone says a great deal about the &ldquo;language&rdquo; women use in relation to investing. It should also offer a pretty good clue as to language not to use &ndash; do not focus exclusively on charts and graphs and performance. While at the end of the day it may be useful information, it is not the way women tend to think about money.</p><p> Once you get down to discussing their finances and you are making recommendations, talk about context for the investment you are considering for them. How does it fit in with their life views? How do the things you recommend connect to what&rsquo;s important to them?</p><p> Remember, for most women, investing is a means to an end, not the end in itself. So talk about what the money will allow them to do with/for other people important to them.</p><h3> Respect her</h3><p> <br/> One would think that it shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary to tell financial advisors to be &ldquo;polite and respectful&rdquo; but there appears to be quite a gap between how men and women interpret this concept.</p><p> The male advisor says, &ldquo;I was on time, I shook hands, presented my materials in an organized business-like fashion &ndash; I even made sure to wipe my feet!&rdquo;</p><p> The female client says, &ldquo;He never once asked me a question about my job, he was patronizing when I asked him about risks, he seemed to want to rush me into decisions, and he didn&rsquo;t even remember that I had three, not two kids,&rdquo; and so it goes.</p><p> Respect for women means meeting her intellectually where she is, rather than expecting her to find her way to you.</p><h3> Build her confidence</h3><p> <br/> Notwithstanding that women have made undeniable progress in their personal and work lives, a confidence gap persists when it comes to investing.</p><p> This does not mean that you should treat them like children. Lacking confidence in their financial investment capabilities does not mean women are clueless &ndash; not by a long shot.</p><p> While a male client is likely to be disinclined to admit he doesn&rsquo;t understand something and you may be able to &lsquo;gloss over&rsquo; certain details &ndash; a female client will hold your feet to the fire. She wants answers. She is more interested in learning than in appearing to know it all.</p><p> According to research, half of the women surveyed want their advisor to &ldquo;make me a smarter investor.&rdquo; But it doesn&rsquo;t mean hauling out the power point presentation and launching into complex discussions about &ldquo;betas&rdquo; and &ldquo;alphas&rdquo; and &ldquo;P/E ratios.&rdquo; It means answering her questions. It&rsquo;s about helping her understand, where she is now, where she is going and how she is going to get there.</p><p> Women want to understand the whole process; they want a sense of context for investing. What is their role in the relationship? What is your part? What comes first and next? And finally, what does success look like? Be careful not to simply site returns.</p><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> Women want advisors to listen to them and speak the language of their lives rather than jargon.

{"original_id":3735,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Becoming Real Innovators","link":"becoming-real-innovators","source_link":null,"content":"&ldquo;They are ill discoverers that think there is no land when they can see nothing but sea.&rdquo; ― Francis Bacon<h3> Companies today are eagerly seeking the answer to one essential question. How do we innovate?</h3>Today, 75% of companies say they&rsquo;re committed to innovation as one of their top priorities [1]. But most struggle to innovate. To many corporations, it&rsquo;s like grabbing the wind in their hands. There must be a trick to it! Perhaps they just have to hire people that are born that way. Perhaps they have to commit a larger budget to the effort. So they keep trying. Some are successful. But mostly, they&rsquo;re not. Why is this true? Is innovation truly that difficult? Is there a secret science that&rsquo;s elusive and only accessible by a few individuals that some companies are fortunate to have? What&rsquo;s the secret?What&rsquo;s the difference between Apple, which goes from being a computer company to a company that&rsquo;s in the music business, the phone business, the watch business, the TV business and the car business, and Kodak, a company that once dominated its category and is now bankrupt? Why is it that companies know they should innovate, that they&rsquo;re committed to innovation, that they can see many examples of companies that successfully innovate, yet they fail miserably at the task? This begs the question: what&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;knowing that&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowing how?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the difference between knowledge and skill? How do we differentiate between knowing the skills that are required to innovate and actually being successful at innovation?Take the example of riding a bike. As a father, I can tell my daughter many facts about riding a bike: put your foot on the forward pedal to start, look straight ahead, lean into the turn, steer to keep your balance. But just knowing these facts does not a bike rider make! In fact, if she pays too much attention to each of these skills, leaning &ldquo;just the right amount&rdquo;, or finding the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; way to push the pedals, she will actually lose her balance. Instead, those facts, that knowledge, must be integrated into the skill. They need to become second nature. Only then will she become a bike rider.Ahh, but, once she gets it about riding a bike, two incredible things happen. First, amazingly, she can&rsquo;t unlearn this skill. She absolutely can&rsquo;t forget how to do this. Once a bike rider, never a non-bike rider! Second, and this is very transformative, once she&rsquo;s a bike rider, the whole world opens up to her in &ldquo;bikish&rdquo; ways that she never ever conceived of before. To quote Dr. Seuss, &ldquo;Oh the places you&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; [2] You recognize an entire universe of things that you never really understood before. You can show off (&ldquo;Look Mom!&rdquo;). You can explore your world. You can exercise. You can get to places of convenience. You can compete! So it is with innovation.<h3> The Keys To Innovation</h3>So what in effect then are some of the keys to innovation? What is the essence of innovation that leads companies to become perennial innovators that in fact can&rsquo;t &ldquo;not innovate?&rdquo; Most companies have a well-rehearsed list of the attributes of successful innovation: brainstorm, think outside the box, fail fast, be agile, follow a lean startup approach, build a minimum viable product, ready fire aim, pivot, etc. What can get companies over the hump from knowing that they should innovate and from knowing the constituent skills that comprise innovation to being companies where innovation happens as a matter of course?If you search Amazon Books for &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; [3] you&rsquo;ll find 60,000+ results. Clearly, answering this question is an area of differing opinion and knowing &ldquo;the answer&rdquo; of course is a fool&rsquo;s errand. That said, two principles stand out that can help companies go from &ldquo;making innovation a priority&rdquo; to actually innovating.<h3> Principle #1: Demanding Certainty Kills Innovation</h3>&ldquo;If you want to have good ideas, you must have many ideas.&rdquo; &mdash; Linus PaulingUnderstand that certainty is the mortal enemy of innovation. In those 75% of companies that are committed to innovation, it&rsquo;s all too common to hear about the launching of an innovation &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; with the accompanying hoopla and ceremony. Implied in this launching though is a demand for X results within a Y timeframe. Executives want to report measurable results with certainty, otherwise the entire effort is deemed a failure. Unfortunately, a demand of certainty in the innovation contract can be the kiss of death. Why is this? Because it conveniently opens the back door to irresponsibility. Starting an innovation &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; after all means executives can point to something tangible that demonstrates the company&rsquo;s commitment to innovation. Now, they can sit back and let the &ldquo;innovation team&rdquo; manage the results.Here&rsquo;s the question however. If the firm is so committed to innovation, which they should be, then why is it an initiative at all? Why isn&rsquo;t it deeply bred into the company&rsquo;s culture where innovation would happen as a matter of course? Of course you&rsquo;ll need discipline and accountability. But companies that innovate, can&rsquo;t &ldquo;not innovate.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;innovation initiatives.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t demand certainty in &ldquo;innovations&rdquo;, either in number or quality or fit or ROI. In fact, demanding certainty and imposing predetermined structure in innovation crowds out ideas and creativity. In innovative organizations, innovation is de rigueur because it&rsquo;s deeply embedded in the culture and not doing so wouldn&rsquo;t actually make any sense.<h3> Principle #2: Innovation is Discovery, Not Creation</h3>&ldquo;Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.&rdquo; &mdash; MichelangeloLike balance in bike-riding, the key to innovation is discovery, the sense that you&rsquo;re uncovering something, vs. creation, the idea that you&rsquo;re dreaming up something entirely new. The symbol so often used for innovation is a light bulb. The picture is, that for a long period of time, there&rsquo;s darkness. Then suddenly, as if a light bulb turns on, there&rsquo;s an idea that just pops into your head, and all goes from darkness to light. It&rsquo;s as if you were blind, searching around, stumbling perhaps, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, a light bulb appears, in fact illuminating something brand new that you had no concept of before. Of course, it almost never happens that way. As complexity scholar Brian Arthur notes, &ldquo;Invention is not an event signaled by some striking breakthrough. It is process &ndash; usually a lengthy and untidy one &ndash; of linking a purpose with a principle (some generic use of an effect) that will satisfy it.&rdquo; [4].As an innovator, you see much uncertainty, surrounded by waves of possibility, possibilities that you can&rsquo;t really articulate, but you sense them. You know that you&rsquo;re headed towards a destination. You see that you&rsquo;re actually getting to know that possibility. You get confirmation that you&rsquo;re actually on to something. And then that possibility becomes clearer and clearer as you get closer and closer. It in fact becomes so obvious you wonder how you didn&rsquo;t know it all the time. Like riding a bike, you wonder, &ldquo;what was so hard about that?&rdquo; And the process actually doesn&rsquo;t seem like magic. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like grabbing the wind. It is, in fact, a process, that when mastered, becomes part and parcel of how you do business, of how your company functions.<h3> Innovation is Counter Intuitive</h3>Of course companies want to innovate. They recognize without a doubt the importance, in fact, the absolute urgency of the need to innovate for their very survival. But knowing and doing are two different things. Innovation is especially challenging in the chasm between knowing and doing. It is in fact, counter-intuitive, like riding a bike.&ldquo;Lean into the turn? I&rsquo;ll certainly crash!&rdquo; No, you&rsquo;ll find a whole new world opens up for you!&ldquo;Allow freedom and uncertainty in my organization so that ideas flow and innovators can travel the path to the discovery of new and compelling products and services?&rdquo; Yes! You&rsquo;ll find that your company will shift dramatically into one that can&rsquo;t not innovate. That in fact your people will be inspired and that ideas will flow freely and people will recognize new discoveries on the horizon. That they&rsquo;ll know there&rsquo;s freedom, in fact responsibility, to uncover those ideas, to develop them, to deliver them. You will, in fact, almost without knowing it, have joined the ranks of the real innovators![1] &ldquo;Innovation in 2014.&rdquo; <u> <a href=\"http://www.bcgperspectives.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.bcgperspectives.com </a></u>.

The IT Department not only supports several business systems used by C-levels, they are also the sole manager of the company&rsquo;s databases and data warehouse where raw business data is transformed into valuable information used by analysts, controllers and various stakeholders in the company.</p><p> There is a catch to all this: Without the right people, knowledge sharing and efficient processes, all your efforts will be worth less than intended. For the CFO to know about IT systems and the CIO to know about the business needs, both departments must collaborate closer than ever before. </p><h3> Data: Not only yours &ndash; but everybody&rsquo;s business</h3><p> <br/> Any company that vies for a place among the corporate stars needs their data faster and organized in a more efficient way than is the case in many companies today. Inefficient BI reporting systems, delays in processes and inefficient data extraction causing delays continue to be real challenges in many organizations.

When this occurs, the best step is to take time to list all of those. Then study the list, prioritize and contemplate your next steps.  This applies to personal well-being as well as advancing your career.</p><p> Stop, Listen, Contemplate and then Reposition</p><h3> My Story</h3><p> <br/> I do all of the above when it&rsquo;s my turn for the tidal wave of criticism to hit.   So I&rsquo;m somewhat surprised when medium sized businesses do not do the same. It&rsquo;s my opinion that if they wish to grow into larger sized businesses, it would be of their best interest to listen.</p><h3> Worst example</h3><p> <br/> One site deliberately crafted their allure for subscription to their service with misleading verbiage. Even worse the fee increased almost 1000% after one month of usage. Upon ending the agreement, I was made a &ldquo;rare offer&rdquo; of only a 500% monthly increase.</p><p> I kindly suggested that the team get together to revise the verbiage on their website. Surely I&rsquo;m not the sole person who did not catch the real meaning. It would save them hours of customer support time. Even worse, over time, they could hurt their brand and reputation.</p><p> The suggestion was met with complete annoyance.</p><h3> Great example</h3><p> <br/> I was gifted a wonderful cooking delivery service, that of Blue Apron.  Instead of asking if I would like to continue to subscribe, it was just assumed the answer would be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.   Once you experience the service, you will understand why.  However, it is best to not make assumptions.</p><p> A great conclusion to our conversation was two-fold:</p><li> Not being charged for the next automated delivery.</li><li> It was suggested I gift someone who may enjoy the service.  I did just that. The gentleman was thrilled!

There are one of two reasons they sting: either there is an element of truth attached and now it needs to be admitted, or they don&rsquo;t understand your business model. Eliminate the latter.</p><h3> Prioritize</h3><p> <br/> Begin with either the easiest suggestion to fix or the one that upsets you the most. Then move on to the next until you get through the list.  Once you have fixed the issues and are  positioned to improve delivery for your clientele, you are on your way to growing sales.

I am often asked if they are worthwhile, and if so, how does one get the best results from them?</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s the no frills, cut straight to the chase, bottom line answer.</p><p> Pre-approach letters are sent to give the adviser something to talk about.</p><p> If you were in the business of giving away $100 dollar bills to anyone that answered the phone, business would be easy wouldn&rsquo;t it?  You have something of value to give them immediately.  You are not concerned by having people at the other end not answering, or for some bizarre reason not wanting a free $100 bill.  You&rsquo;d just call people.  Sending a letter first is for the benefit of the adviser, not the consumer.</p><p> The problem for many advisers is they don&rsquo;t quite know how to initiate a conversation with a prospective client without appearing too &ldquo;salesy&rdquo;&hellip;so many send something in the mail (and some do this electronically) to softly introduce the fact that they want to talk.</p><p> From the perspective of giving the adviser confidence and a topic to talk about, sales letters do have a use.  There is a secondary and often under-estimated benefit though: very few consumers get mail that is not a bill anymore.  So handwritten envelopes with old-fashioned stamps and personal letter inside actually are quite effective in getting people&rsquo;s attention today.</p><p> I am not suggesting that they are a fabulous marketing technique, but conventional mail should not be dismissed out of hand &ndash; it may well have a place in your overall marketing mix.</p><h3> If you are going to send letters to prospects with the hope of getting either their attention or their interest (or preferably both), there are some things you have to get right for the letters to be effective.</h3><h3> <br/> 1. The headline. </h3><p> Any pre-approach letter has to have a subject, and the headline should capture the attention of the reader and entice them to read on about the subject.</p><h3> 2. It has to get straight to answering the WIIFM.  </h3><p> The reader is asking&rdquo;what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; &ndash; and you have to give them a reason to read&hellip;and give them a reason to talk to you after they&rsquo;ve read the letter.</p><h3> 3. There has to be a CTA. </h3><p> What do want the reader to do once they&rsquo;ve read the letter?  There has to be a clear call-to-action.</p><h3> 4. Write like you are having a conversation. </h3><p> Now this point will undoubtedly upset many&hellip;.but spelling matters to most people &ndash; though grammar doesn&rsquo;t matter quite so much.  Write conversationally, and use words that you would use in a conversation &ndash; don&rsquo;t get hung up on sentence structure too much.  For heaven&rsquo;s sake though do NOT use text-speak!  If you are writing to someone who can only converse in text speak, then text them.  Don&rsquo;t waste a stamp.</p><h3> 5. Do not exaggerate or use hyperbole. </h3><p> People will be put off by the offer of a deal of a lifetime arriving in their mailbox&hellip;.</p><h3> 6. Include credentials &amp; contact details. </h3><p> Your return address, every possible way of contacting you or checking your credentials (including social media!) should be made available.  People like to do a little bit of checking before they decide to use an adviser &ndash; so make it as easy as possible for them.</p><h3> 7. Use &ldquo;you&rdquo; at least twice as much as &ldquo;I&rdquo;. </h3><p> Any letter has to be for the benefit of the recipient&hellip;not an ego trip for the author.</p><h3> The final point is answering the inevitable question of &ldquo;how long should the letter be?&rdquo;.</h3><p> <br/> A letter should be as long as is necessary while being interesting to the reader.</p><p> No more; no less.  It really doesn&rsquo;t matter if a letter is 5 pages long if it is engaging&hellip;people read novels all the time for entertainment, so the length is actually a moot point.  However, if you can hit all the key points and provide a sound reason for them to talk to you all within a single page, then that is fantastic.</p><p> While letters will often be considered by many to be ancient history, even someone who is a digital marketing enthusiast (such as myself) should concede that they may well have a place in cutting through the advertising clutter.</p><p> If your marketing mix is lacking a genuinely personal touch that is not intrusive, then it just may be that a little bit of the old snail-mail might still have a use.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-27 18:34:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-27 18:34:10.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_wRq3f5A.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-sales-letters-ancient-history/\", \"post_id\": \"8239\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-27 18:34:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-27 18:34:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-sales-letters-ancient-history\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8236\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3870\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-Tips-for-Driving-Your-Organization-Into-the-Age-of-Data.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"500\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451300400,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3739,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"2015: The Year That the #FinTech Bubble Exploded","link":"2015-the-year-that-the-fintech-bubble-exploded","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Yes, 2015 was the year that the Fintech bubble exploded.  It hasn&rsquo;t burst yet, but it&rsquo;s clear that Fintech is the word of 2015.  Everyone is talking unicorns, start-ups, disruption, Fintech ... and yet this is nothing new.  I often say that I&rsquo;m only known in the Fintech world because I&rsquo;ve worked in technology in finance all my life and finally someone decided to put the words together and merge them.  Like Brangelina, Kimye and Bennifer, Fintech is of the moment.</p>I blogged this year about <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/12/fintech-by-the-numbers.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the Fintech numbers </a></u> and don&rsquo;t intend to do that again, but did want to touch on a different view: what is emerging in the Fintech world?<h3> For me, there are five clear areas of change:</h3><h3> Value Transfer:</h3>From TransferWise to Square to Stripe to Currency Cloud to Azimo to WorldRemit, all aspects of payments and currency movements are being revamped and rethought by the new Fintech players;<h3> Value Form:</h3>With the rise of so many forms of cryptocurrency from bitcoin to Gaelcoin, alongside other value tokens such as mobile minutes, we are seeing the way in which people exchange value being redesigned by the internet, particularly as value tokens are now data rather than physical bank notes;<h3> Value Management:</h3>Our stores of value are also being redeveloped by robo-advisors like Nutmeg, Betterment and Wealthfront, as well as the way our accounts are presented to us from a mobile wallet to a fully-fledged personal financial management system with visualization tools;<h3> Credit Risk:</h3>Everything related to connecting people who have money with people who need money is being targeted by new platforms and marketplaces that enable these two communities to connect at better rates and lower margin than through traditional credit markets, and this is not just for peer-to-peer lending but for everything from crowdfunding trade finance to mortgages; and<h3> Trading:</h3>The fact that the internet enabled day traders to rise from their home offices has now extended to social trading and automated trading structures; although most high frequency traders are using proprietary low latency infrastructures, the ability to piggyback markets and trading oracles is giving rise to whole new forms of investment markets.There are other nuances of these markets and, in 2015, everyone seemed to wake up to the fact that this is headline news.  I guess it&rsquo;s because we finally woke up to the idea that Fintech is actually redesigning banking, insurance, wealth management and financial services generally to be marketplaces based upon technology platforms instead of localized markets based upon physical exchange.  This does not take place fast, so expect the interest in Fintech to continue in 2016.  Then, the natural question is: is this a bubble about to burst?I answered this <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/03/is-the-fintech-bubble-about-to-burst.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  in March </a></u>, saying that the re-architecting of an entire system is not a bubble but an evolving ecosystem.  However, the hype around Fintech might get dented in 2016 as Square&rsquo;s IPO disappoints as will several more in the next year.According to M&amp;A advisers <u> <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/230435/whats-going-to-happen-to-the-tech-industry-in-2016-fewer-ipos-compressed-unicorn-valuation-and-slowing-ma-activity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Magister Advisors </a></u> this means that 2016 will see:<h3> Don&rsquo;t hold your breath for tech IPOs</h3>IPOs come in waves, and all signs point to a quiet sea next year. Interest rate rises coupled with macro/political uncertainty will give an already unsteady IPO market serious vertigo.<h3> Expect a unicorn (or two) to blow up...</h3>The tale of Fab.com showed just how quickly you can go from a $1 billion valuation to a $15 million fire sale. Magister Advisors are expecting at least one tech unicorn will go to the glue factory in 2016.<h3> ...leading to inevitable mass lay-offs</h3>Unicorns, with an aggregate valuation of $500 billion, are overvalued by $200 billion, according to Magister Advisors, which expects layoffs will be inevitable next year as valuations compress, leaving the &ldquo;weakest 10-20 per cent&rdquo; of workforces to look for their next job unexpectedly early.  The biggest losers of a decelerating market will be the &ldquo;Unicorn aspirants&rdquo; aiming to raise $15-50 million at $100-500 million valuations.<h3> Overheated mergers will cool off</h3>M&amp;A activity has hit a record high in 2015, but will slow considerably for the tech sector in 2016 as valuations reset, Magister Advisors predict.Expectations take time to reset, and always lag reality. Many investors will not accept a new lower normal, until at least 9-15 months have passed. Meanwhile there will be an imbalance between seller price expectations and what buyers are prepared to pay, taming the M&amp;A market while price expectations re-align.Expect M&amp;A activity to return with a vengeance by 2017-2018 though, once expectations are more in line with reality.<h3> Blockchain will dominate the fintech sector</h3>2015 saw large financial institutions accelerate their pursuit of blockchain initiatives, and we will enter 2016 in a &ldquo;race to production&rdquo;, with vendors and financial institutions alike vying to see who can be first to reap the benefits in actual deployment.

{"original_id":3740,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Reap the Rewards of Everyday Transitions","link":"reap-the-rewards-of-everyday-transitions","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It&rsquo;s that time of year. Major transitions.</h3><p> <br/> We switch from work mode into holiday mode. We transition from one year to the next. A time to recalibrate, an impulse toward reflection. We tend to savor these shifts.</p><p> On any given work day, we are likely to hustle through a host of activities. One activity butts up against the next. No transition times. None. As we settle into bed at night, the day that passed seems like a giant blur.</p><h3> Not much savoring went on.</h3><p> <br/> Transitions create separation. They sharpen our focus. They crystallize individual moments. And they are so easily created. Here are some very simple ways in which you and I can harness the power of transitions, every single day:</p><h3> 1. Appointment Transitions</h3><p> <br/> Whenever possible, give yourself 5 minutes between meetings. If you&rsquo;re the one who leads the meeting, end 5 minutes early so everyone in attendance gets their 5 minutes. During these 5 minutes, resist the temptation to fill it with frenetic activity. These are 5 minutes to reflect on the preceding activity. 5 minutes to get mentally prepared for the next event. Instead of carrying the energy of one segment of your day into the next, you proceed with clear focus and a fresh purpose.</p><h3> 2. Meeting Transitions</h3><p> <br/> When you begin a meeting, resist the temptation to dive right into the agenda. Chances are, no one present is fully ready to engage. Give yourself 5 minutes of transition time at the start of the meeting. 5 minutes of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; social engagement. 5 minutes for a brain teaser, a humorous video. These are 5-minutes of &ldquo;get present&rdquo; time. Take 5 minutes, and you will be rewarded with a significantly more engaged conversation.</p><h3> 3. Mealtime Transitions</h3><p> <br/> It pains me that some folks don&rsquo;t have time to take a lunch-break at work. I also don&rsquo;t much favor the environment in which your company feeds you in-house, as appealing as that may seem. Lunch-time is a potent opportunity to shake it up. Get out of the office. Get a bit of fresh air &ndash; literally and metaphorically. Decompress and re-energize yourself. A whiff of out-of-office energy will powerfully infuse every one of your post-lunch activities. Savor your food transitions.</p><h3> 4. Evening Transitions</h3><p> <br/> How often has your spouse admonished you for &ldquo;bringing your work home with you&rdquo; at night? This comment usually does not imply you&rsquo;re doing actual work at home. No, you are mentally still at work. Talking compulsively about events of the day. Carrying work stress in your body. Make sure you have clear transitions between work time and home time. Time at the gym. A run. 10 minutes of meditation. 10 minutes of laying on your bed, doing nothing. Time where you simply stop.</p><p> The rewards of an everyday transition? You suddenly experience a lot more texture in any given day. Individual portions of your day stand out. Individual activities become more meaningful.</p><p> And you are more productive, to boot.</p><p> You like rewards, don&rsquo;t you?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-27 19:29:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-27 19:29:44.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_Rrj2rJs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/reap-the-rewards-of-everyday-transitions/\", \"post_id\": \"8243\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-27 19:29:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-27 19:29:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"reap-the-rewards-of-everyday-transitions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8242\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3872\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Reap-the-Rewards-of-Everyday-Transitions.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"822\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451295900,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3741,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Differences Between a Boss and a Leader, Explained","link":"the-differences-between-a-boss-and-a-leader-explained","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Everyone who manages employees is a boss of some sort. But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they're leaders too.</h3><p> <br/> Huh? What&rsquo;s the difference between a boss and a leader, anyway?</p><p> We&rsquo;re glad you asked. There are certain leadership qualities that separate these two concepts. And let's just say that, as a manager, you want to lean towards the leader side. Here are the characteristics that differentiate the two.</p><h3> 1. Bosses are always the focus. Leaders give credit where credit&rsquo;s due</h3><p> <br/> Bosses tend to think highly of themselves &mdash; and for the wrong reasons. When the team succeeds at a project or an initiative, bosses are quick to take credit. On the other hand, when something fails, bosses are quick to assign blame.</p><p> Leaders, as you&rsquo;d expect, pretty much do the opposite. They understand that team victories are precisely that: the result of the entire team&rsquo;s labors. Leaders shower their employees with recognition, and they also take the blame when things go wrong.</p><h3> 2. Bosses may be liked or hated. Leaders are loved</h3><p> <br/> Being a boss doesn&rsquo;t automatically disqualify you from being a likeable person. But bosses can still be immensely disliked, particularly if they&rsquo;re the do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do type.</p><p> Because they are in the proverbial trenches with their team every day and inspire their staffs, leaders are loved. These folks have a clearly defined vision, and they&rsquo;re charismatic to the point where everyone blindly follows.</p><h3> 3. Bosses can be good or bad. Leaders are only good</h3><p> <br/> You can have a great boss, and you can have a terrible boss. But you can only have a fantastic leader.</p><p> That&rsquo;s because when managers are leaders, they&rsquo;re equipped with a long list of attractive qualities that are proven to improve engagement, camaraderie, and productivity. Leaders inspire their staffs to reach their full potential, which ultimately does wonders for their respective organizations.</p><h3> 4. Bosses can be scary. Leaders are friendly and caring</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s hope you&rsquo;ve never had the kind of boss who instills fear in their workforce, the kind that causes everyone to shut up and dive back into work the moment their presence is felt. These kinds of bosses, of course, are undesirable.</p><p> On the other side of the coin, leaders are known for developing and growing personal relationships with their mployees. Leaders smile as much as they can, and they genuinely care about what&rsquo;s going on in the lives of their employees &mdash; all of which adds up to create a more welcoming and relaxed atmosphere at the office.</p><h3> 5. Bosses can be hard to get in touch with. Leaders keep their doors open</h3><p> <br/> Ever try to schedule a meeting with a boss to talk about something only to get the run around? Bosses feel as though they&rsquo;ve worked their whole lives to get to this point in their career. Many of them feel they&rsquo;re above helping their lowly employees; that&rsquo;s what the middle managers are for.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/?utm_source=unpaid&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=blogtrial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leaders, on the other hand, always have their doors open  </a> </u> . Not only is it easy for employees to approach them with any questions, concerns, or ideas they may have, leaders also show initiative and schedule meetings with employees they suspect might need them. The end result? A more cohesive, connected team.</p><h3> 6. Bosses expect employees to get things done. Leaders coach them</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no shortage of work needing to be tackled at any given organization. Bosses are great at making sure things get done: They assign a deadline and scowl at their staffs until tasks are completed. This isn&rsquo;t the most efficient approach to work, however, particularly if employees aren&rsquo;t exactly sure how to get things done but are afraid to ask their bosses for help. Under these kinds of regimes, work often has to be revised and revised again before it can be signed off on.</p><p> Understanding that their employees don&rsquo;t have the same skills or experience as them, leaders take a more proactive approach with their employees, coaching them through assignments. In addition to reducing the likelihood they&rsquo;ll have to lend as much of a hand in the future, leaders work to make sure projects are done right the first time.</p><h3> 7. Bosses tell team members what to do. Leaders ask who should do what</h3><p> <br/> Bosses believe they have it all figured out. Sure, they&rsquo;ve hired great people, but at the end of the day, the buck stops solely at their desk. In this vein, bosses tell their employees what to do. They don&rsquo;t care if anyone has any better ideas.</p><p> Leaders are smarter than that. They know their team is full of folks who have great ideas &mdash; and because of their proximity to the tasks at hand, may very well know better ways to do certain things. So they ask who should do what, or who wants to do what, and they&rsquo;re not embarrassed about it. They build consensus, and the team is that much stronger for it.</p><h3> 8. Bosses know what needs to be done. Leaders get things done</h3><p> <br/> With their MBAs in hand and their immaculate resumes in tow, bosses have all the credentials in the world to prove to you how awesome they are. They know the ins and outs of their industry, and they know exactly what needs to be done. Thing is, rather than actually do it, they command their team to do it. In some instances, it almost appears as though bosses don&rsquo;t do anything at all.</p><p> Leaders, to the contrary, get things done. They understand that talk is cheap, so instead they let their actions speak louder than their words.</p><h3> 9. Bosses blame workers for problems. Leaders fix problems</h3><p> <br/> Why take responsibility when things go wrong if you don&rsquo;t have to? Well, from a managerial perspective, because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. Bosses, however, are quick to blame their team members for dropping the ball. They don&rsquo;t understand the shortsightedness of their behavior.</p><p> Rather than complaining about something that&rsquo;s gone wrong and being mad about it, leaders work efficiently to rectify the situation. They understand that all workers are human, and as such, mistakes are bound to happen from time to time.</p><h3> 10. Bosses are separated from the group. Leaders are immersed in it</h3><p> <br/> Bosses wouldn&rsquo;t dream of sitting in the same room as their employees. They need to have their own office because they&rsquo;re so important. Similarly, bosses won&rsquo;t ever be caught meeting their team members for a happy hour. They have more important people to mingle with.</p><p> Leaders, on the other hand, know that approach is silly. They become fully immersed in the exactly environment as their employees. In some instances &mdash; like at  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/zappos-ceo-hsieh-sits-at-same-desk-as-call-center-workers-2014-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Zappos </a>  &mdash; they even work at the exact same kind of desk in the exact same room.

{"original_id":3742,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do This to Define Your Life and Leadership Vision","link":"do-this-to-define-your-life-and-leadership-vision","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Over the past few years, each member of my family chose  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/five-words-for-your-life-and-leadership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a word to set the tone for the year ahead  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s also an exercise that I used with my clients to help them create an intention for how they wanted to live and lead. Words were chosen that packed a powerful punch like &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; and others chose words like &ldquo;sustain&rdquo; which for them was also a challenge. However, having a word didn&rsquo;t consistently inspire actions aligned with values and purpose; it was missing a tie to a larger life and leadership vision.</p><p> Like many New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, all were in the forefront in January, February, and even March. By June, most of my clients had to be reminded of their word when we looked back over their progress for the first half of the year.</p><p> This year, I&rsquo;m forgoing the one word concept (although I still like it and for some it&rsquo;s definitely a game changer). Instead, I&rsquo;m asking a simple question:</p><h3> What do you most want for your life and leadership vision?</h3><p> <br/> Okay, I lied. Not so simple. Still, this is a tremendous exercise for you to not only set the tone for the year but also define what you want &ndash; create your robust vision. It&rsquo;s more than a word, it&rsquo;s a clear course for what you will create. </p><p> We all know that value of having a clear vision for your department, division or organization, but it works on a personal level too.</p><p> Say it with me: &ldquo;I matter. I&rsquo;m making a promise to myself.&rdquo;</p><p> You don&rsquo;t need to look ahead five years, this is all about a vision for the next 12 months. Before you get started, think about how you best process and reflect.  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/journaling-ideas-new-approach/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   You may want to journal  </u>    </a> out the answers, discuss them with a coach, mentor, friend or partner, or just sit with them until an answer emerges.</p><h3> Ask yourself:</h3><p> <br/> What do I want the year ahead to feel like?</p><p> What kind of memories do I want to have when I look back at the end of next year?</p><p> Who are the key players?</p><p> What kinds of choices do I need to make?</p><p> What will make the hard choices easier?</p><p> What am I willing to give up?</p><p> What am I unwilling to compromise?</p><p> <strong>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/why-your-next-step-isnt-what-you-think/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What values will lead me forward?  </a> </strong></p><h3> Willing to Make Radical Choices for Your Life and Leadership?</h3><p> <br/> When Y2K was fast approaching (remember that?) I was traveling for work Sunday to Friday most weeks. I sat down with my husband and told him I wanted a dog. He laughed and told me that when I was ready to make a significant change, and be there to help care for the dog, we&rsquo;d get one.</p><p> December of 1999 I left a job I both loved and was good at, change management consulting, and took a new job within my company that cut my travel down to one week a month from four; by January, we had our dog. I wanted to feel like a family, my husband was a key player who wasn&rsquo;t getting enough of my time, I was unwilling to continue to live apart.</p><p> <strong>  Radical change is easier when you&rsquo;re clear on what you&rsquo;re moving towards </strong></p><h3> Compromising Values for Success? Not Worth It.</h3><p> <br/> Fast forward to 2010 and I was a VP of People and Innovation for a Fortune 500 company and constantly on the road once again. This time, we no longer had a dog but two (totally awesome) children.</p><p> The son of an important client was visiting our team and his flight home was canceled. I was the senior leader onsite and company senior leadership asked me to change my Friday flight home to hang out, entertain and take him to dinner. Thing was, that day was also my son&rsquo;s fifth birthday and we were going to have a family dinner. Ultimately, I had a less than memorable dinner with a nice kid and missed dinner and cuddles with my kid. Within six months I left the company and started my own coaching and consulting business. Family was not something I was willing to compromise and I was awakening to the fact that I had done it for far too long.</p><p> <strong>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Core+values+are+not+something+that+ebb+and+flow+based+on+client+needs&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/life-and-leadership-vision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Core values are not something that ebb and flow based on client needs  </a> </strong></p><h3> Challenges Can Bring Clarity.</h3><p> <br/> This year ended for me with health issues and unexpected surgery. As I look forward I also took the time to look back. While the first nine months were filled with exciting travel and sweet family moments, there were also times that work led the charge on my life.</p><p> Client calls in the evening were common as was after dinner work long into the night. Running a small business can be all consuming, you are not paid every two weeks unless you&rsquo;re doing billable work. I was not only working, but also constantly focused on new business development. Too many nights family time was taken over by working while the kids played.</p><p> <strong>  In October, everything changed. </strong></p><p> I was away from my family for several months and was grateful to be healthy despite my prolonged recovery. The only time I turned on my phone for weeks wasn&rsquo;t to return client emails or to tweet but to FaceTime with my husband and children.</p><h3> What do I most want in 2016?</h3><p> <br/> There were years I would have said the top things I wanted was more business success, growth, new professional challenges. I still would love those things, but that&rsquo;s not where I landed this time.</p><p> A full life. I am putting having a full life at the very top of the list. No parameters will be set around what that means but when I have opportunities that come up, I&rsquo;ll be able to ask myself if it is moving me closer or farther away from that vision. Work, family, friends, travel, exercise, writing, publishing, speaking, course creation, workshops are all a part of my vision.</p><p> The key to having a full life is enjoying the moment not cramming in as much as possible.</p><p> I will let things go that before I&rsquo;d chase.</p><p> I will be present where I am, and not planning the next only to miss out on the now.</p><p> I will cuddle with my laptop closed.</p><p> I will  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/why-be-creative/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   write and share because it adds a creative energy  </u>    </a> to my life.</p><p> I will make time for the people who matter.</p><p> I will travel to new places and old favorites.</p><p> I will support without judging.</p><p> I will go out of my way to be kind to strangers.</p><p> I will create space in my life for new friends and relationships.</p><p> I will embrace a full life.</p><h3> Break the Frame Action:</h3><p> <br/> After you process the eight questions earlier in this post, put your &ldquo;I will&rdquo; statements in writing. Really, do it. Write them down.</p><p> Post them on your bulletin board or vision board or put them in the front of your planner or make it your screen saver. Don&rsquo;t let June roll around and you vaguely remember your promises to yourself in service of your life and leadership.</p><p> Move beyond what you want to define what you will do. It&rsquo;s action, not ideas alone, that creates change.  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/powerful-ways-get-unstuck-action/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Goals and dreams are within your reach  </a> </u> , but only you (and your aligned actions) can make them happen.</p><p> What do you most want for your life and leadership in 2016?

All uncoordinated and fragmented.</p><p> In Great Britain &ndash; the third most populous island in the world after Java and Honshu &ndash; it fragments even further. Health, Housing, Social Care, Education and the rest go about their business largely in isolation. They congregate on an annual basis at conferences (separately), they lobby politicians (separately), they communicate their &lsquo;message&rsquo; (separately). Even on borderless platforms like Twitter they self-organise using their own hashtags.</p><p> Undoubtedly digital can connect us in ways never before possible &ndash; yet whole sectors are still just talking to themselves.</p><p> So &ndash; who is doing the joining up? Who&rsquo;s making it their job to prevent duplication on a massive scale &ndash; to co-ordinate the research, the tests, the pilots and the learning from failure?</p><p> William Eggars made the answer to this very clear:</p><p> No-one. No-one is doing this.</p><p> So who&rsquo;s job is it?</p><p> And it could be yours?</p><p> I reckon this sector silo thinking, this lack of knowledge sharing at national and international level,  is one of the most wicked problems we face. So how can we reframe it as a wicked opportunity?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take this right down to a practical, organisational level. Here&rsquo;s four suggestions for how we could at least get started:</p><h3> Identify the problem</h3><p> <br/> First of all we need to identify our wicked problems. A lot of organisational strategies actually aren&rsquo;t focused on wicked problems. They are often solutionist (e.g we&rsquo;ll achieve this by 2020 or we&rsquo;ll implement these things in the next three years).  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2008/05/strategy-as-a-wicked-problem\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wicked problems are different  </a> </u> , they can be difficult to get to grips with. Often they won&rsquo;t have a stopping rule,  the search for solutions never stops. Ageing is a good example, you&rsquo;ll never &ldquo;solve&rdquo; it. It requires a different way of looking at it.</p><h3> Reframe them as opportunities</h3><p> <br/> Seeing them as opportunities automatically shifts your mindset into a far more expansive and creative state. An organisation that sees problems as opportunities will develop a much more positive relationship with our world of volatile change. We need colleagues as innovators and entrepreneurs rather than adopting deficit based behaviours. A good example is the UK social housing sector &ndash; which generally adopts an attitude of &ldquo;no-one likes us, no-one will fund us&rdquo;. Rather than being a problem that&rsquo;s a wonderful opportunity. No-one in that sector has a brand value of an Apple or Amazon. Any one of 1500 players could step forward to claim it. </p><h3> Engage your people </h3><p> <br/> Once we&rsquo;ve identified our opportunities &ndash; let&rsquo;s open up our organisations and work out loud.  Silos emerged out of efforts to make our organisations more efficient. In 20th Century command and control management it made sense to operate an industrial mentality of division by function and department. But wicked problems are , by their nature, extremely complex . We need to embrace this complexity and form people around them with range of skills. Your organisational structure chart won&rsquo;t help you here. We need a much more fluid and collaborative model that allows people (employees and citizens) to swarm around the opportunities they are most engaged with.</p><h3> Embrace the network</h3><p> <br/> People are working on the same things as us across the globe. We won&rsquo;t solve things on our own. We are desperately inward looking. Our sectors , our organisations , even our teams. There will always be more talented people outside your organisation than within it &ndash; so lets seek them out. Collaboration is a central theme to innovation because of speed , connections , energy and the ability to fast track implementation.  Most of us have hundreds , thousands or tens of thousands of connections. Worldwide. Let&rsquo;s put them to work.</p><p> Turning this problem into an opportunity won&rsquo;t be easy. We face a hugely competitive funding environment and an incredibly crowded social space.  <strong>  Everyone is fighting for attention. </strong></p><p> Removing the huge duplication might mean we don&rsquo;t all need our own website, back office teams, or even chief executive. We might not all need to exist &ndash; someone might be better placed than you or I to grasp the opportunity.</p><p> But if we are serious about attacking real problems there&rsquo;s no room for vested interests. To address wicked problems our organisations must be reshaped in the shadow of the network. <strong>  The wicked opportunities lie at the heart of it. </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 00:32:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 00:32:30.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_r5sKiif.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/our-next-innovation-challenge-stop-talking-to-ourselves/\", \"post_id\": \"8249\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 00:32:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 00:32:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"our-next-innovation-challenge-stop-talking-to-ourselves\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8248\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3875\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Our-Next-Innovation-Challenge.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"589\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451322000,"author_id":383,"chart_url":""}

After my years in software sales, I will attempt to answer the question in plain English: <strong>  How do salespeople get paid? </strong></p><p> Often salespeople new to the industry are afraid to admit they don&rsquo;t understand how sales salaries work. Unfortunately, in my experience, this is most common during an interview process, when understanding the pay structure matters the most. If you are wondering how typical salesperson compensation works, this post should help give you a basic understanding of how paychecks are calculated.</p><h3> <strong>  Basic Sales Salary Terms </strong></h3><p> <br/> Before we talk about how you might get paid, let&rsquo;s cover a few basic terms that you should know before you start interviewing:</p><li> Base Salary refers to a salary you receive that is not based on your sales performance.  Just showing up will earn you a base salary, but you may not have your job for very long.</li><li> Quota is really just another word for a goal you must hit. A quota is the total dollar value, or number of items you are supposed to sell. This is typically assigned for a given time period such as 1 year.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission\" target=\"_blank\">   Commission  </a> </u>  has more than 10 definitions on Wikipedia, so don&rsquo;t feel bad if you are wondering what this means. In sales, commission means the amount of money you earn based on making a sale. This is usually a percentage of the sale value or an amount based on how many units you sell.</li><li> On Target Earnings (OTE) is what you can expect to make if you hit 100% your quota. This is a combination of your base salary (if you have one) plus your commission or bonus.</li><li> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiff\" target=\"_blank\">   Spiff  </a> </u>  is some sort of extra reward you get for selling something very specific. This is often used to push a certain item. If a computer store wants to get rid of last year&rsquo;s printer models they might offer an extra $25 for every printer you sell of that model. A spiff is above and beyond what you typically would earn for making the same sale. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Most Common Pay Structures for Salespeople </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  100% Commission. </strong> <br/> Where you&rsquo;ll see it: real estate, selling knives door to door (think Cutco) <br/> 100% commission means you do not make a penny unless you sell something. For the most part this model is typically not regarded as advantageous for experienced salespeople. It could take months to make your first sale and you could go through slow periods, which may not always be your fault. 100% commission can be highly financially rewarding in some situations but it comes with a lot of risk.</li><li> <strong>  Base Salary + Commission. </strong> <br/> Where you&rsquo;ll see it: almost everywhere (think inside-sales reps,  <u>  BDRs </u> ) <br/> This is a very common model where you make a base salary no matter what you sell and then receive commission on top of that base salary. Having a base salary shares some of the risk with the employer but still allows a salesperson to make a good chunk of their salary based on their performance. This is one of my personal favourite models because as an employer, you get quality salespeople and as an employee, you still have a lot of control over your earning potential.</li><li> <strong>  Salary + Bonus. </strong> <br/> Where you&rsquo;ll see it: sales engineers, account management positions <br/> Organizations can offer a base salary plus a bonus based on a salesperson&rsquo;s performance. This model works well when a salesperson is responsible for more &ldquo;account management&rdquo; vs. constantly winning new business. Typically these bonuses are not paid out based on a specific deal you close, but rather a bonus paid quarterly or annually based on an overall goal you are set to hit.</li><p> Hope these explanations help you on your job hunt!</p><p> <strong>  Remember&mdash;understanding your compensation will help ensure three things: </strong></p><li> Your pay structure fits your lifestyle and risk tolerance</li><li> You are earning a competitive wage based on your skills</li><li> You look like you know what you&rsquo;re talking about in an interview <br/>  </li><p> Good luck out there and let me know if there&rsquo;s another definition you&rsquo;re looking for!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 01:48:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 01:48:47.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_F15M8ye.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-do-salespeople-get-paid/\", \"post_id\": \"8253\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 01:48:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 01:48:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-do-salespeople-get-paid\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8250\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3878\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Social-Media-Strategies-Applied-to-Events.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"676\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451332800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

In the past, they might have worked together and had shared activities and responsibilities. Their relationship went beyond just the 'business' part of a marriage. Yet something occurs when one person becomes unhappy. They start to distance themselves from their partner in ways that are subtle at first, but become much more obvious as time moves on. </p><p> When couples begin to uncouple, they begin to live independent lives &ndash; parallel lives. They spend less energy and time focusing on rebuilding or maintaining the relationship and more time on outside, singular interests.  Over a period of months (or even years), the tide changes &ndash; typically only with one person &ndash; much like a 'slow burn' in relationships. Several things occur right below the surface &ndash; often on a subconscious level. Someone might say, 'We are drifting apart. I am really not sure what is going on. I just can't put my finger on it. But I have less interest in my spouse and commitment to the marriage, and more thoughts about life without him, but also a willingness to try and put more effort into the marriage.' At this time, many are unsure about what to do about the marriage or relationship.</p><p> As the uncoupling continues, one person in the relationship starts to experience inner angst and uncertainty about the future with their partner &ndash; even though, at one point, this seemed unimaginable. Their future together was not questionable. Now, the person who is questioning the marriage or relationship is not sure how or when their feelings changed &ndash; they just know that they have. The person attempts to make sense out of their relationship or marriage, which has taken an unfamiliar direction. They are unaware of how they were becoming \"uncoupled\", how they got here, what to do, or how their relationship has unraveled. They seek answers, direction, insight, and (hopefully) clarity. Trying to get back the feelings they once felt so easily and had such a natural affinity for feels arduous, uncomfortable, and, for some, painstakingly &ldquo;hard&rdquo;.</p><p> In her book titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Uncoupling-Turning-Points-Intimate-Relationships/dp/0679730028/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315154604&amp;sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Uncoupling  </u>  ,  </a> Diane Vaughan states that the uncoupling process starts with a secret. The person who is unhappy is deemed the \"initiator\" &ndash; the holder of the secret. Secrets create a power difference, as the person who has the secret holds this information from the partner. They are making the unilateral decision whether or not to share their secret, their feelings, or the ambivalence they are experiencing with the relationship or marriage. They are keeping their partner in the dark. Initially, complaints by the initiator may be looked upon by the partner as small or trivial; however, the initiator interprets these complaints as negative flaws. Even with this, the initiator continues to explore their feelings in an attempt to understand what went wrong and why they feel the way they do.</p><p> When the initiator starts to express their discontent, they often do so by focusing on the failings or shortcoming of the other person. They may attempt to address this issue with their partner, but words are hard to express. Their words turn into critical behaviors. Gone are the days of positive affirmations. The initiator soon finds fault with their partner, only focusing on the negative and excluding the positive.</p><h3> What's the 'punchline' of the uncoupling process?</h3><p> <br/> It varies for each couple and depends on their history, their commitment level, and if they are willing to be honest with their partner about their feelings.</p><p> Uncoupling at this time can be looked at as a bridge - a bridge that divides the two sides, where the marriage is no longer salvageable or a bridge that connects the two sides - where both people make strong attempts to stay together</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 16:26:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 16:26:09.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_cDfDnA4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-couples-begin-to-uncouple/\", \"post_id\": \"8255\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 16:26:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 16:26:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-couples-begin-to-uncouple\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8254\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3879\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-Couples-Begin-to-Uncouple-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1076\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451408400,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3748,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Content Marketing Isn't Just the Future, It's the Present","link":"content-marketing-isnt-just-the-future-its-the-present","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Large financial firms communicate often in one style to the market place. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for consumers tune out the common messages and themes because they all start to sound the same! Content marketing is an area where the smaller independent firms can shine and create positive impact. Everyone has watched commercials with a monotone sounding person discussing investments and retirement planning. Marketing is more than a flash in a pan; it is a personalized preview that entices prospective clients and consumers to take an interest in your products and services. Financial advisers offer more than numbers and advice. They are not fortunetellers, rather fortune foreshadow tellers.  With skepticism high and trust low, more consumers value personal connections than ever before.</p><p> Content marketing is about personalizing the experience for consumers.</p><h3> Here are steps to help you achieve content marketing success:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Give free advice</h3><p> <br/> Anything free is great! The prospect feels as though someone understands their needs and actually cares about them! For instance, a recently divorced adult who is vulnerable may want to purchase an expensive car or plan a fancy vacation.  However, these impulsive decisions would compromise his/her financial stability. On your company&rsquo;s website, you could provide pertinent information and financial tips for people experiencing divorce.</p><h3> 2. Make it personal and accessible</h3><p> <br/> Another possibility is to have a blog post describing a similar situation or challenge. Through these messages, the prospective customer can see himself/herself and envision working with your. Providing access checklists and other helpful information can ease the burden of a client having to search and sift through information. Place these items on your mobile responsive easily accessible website.</p><h3> 3. Help clients to feel safe</h3><p> <br/> Spending money is a huge decision and asking for help on managing financial affairs requires trust.</p><p> Clients need to feel their wallet and life are safe. Allowing clients to identify their own financial goals and concerns helps them feel included in the process. Creating a YouTube video of a financial counseling session with a couple on buying a home is an example of content marketing. The video explains the financial risks and benefits. The video could also address frequently asked questions about the home buying process.  Such an authentic video demonstrates that you can talk the talk and walk the walk. It appeals to someone who is apprehensive about meeting with a financial advisor.</p><h3> 4. Connect on their level</h3><p> <br/> Content marketing can make the financial world less intimidating.  Make a meme to connect with Millennials.  It could be showing something in popular culture such as the show &ldquo;2 Broke Girls&rdquo; and having a funny saying about saving up for a business. The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon is a great example of using social media as content marketing. His segment called &ldquo;Hash tags&rdquo; engages viewers.  Consider using a twitter hash tag that says #BIGGESTSUCCESS and use your company twitter handle. Retweet the unique and creative responses.</p><h3> Seeing results</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Make it visual</h3><p> <br/> Using Instagram or other social media platforms is a great way to connect to others. Generally when people are using social media, they are more relaxed and receptive to new ideas and concepts. Create posts to show satisfied customers and the results of your company. For example pictures of a client holding keys to a new car or a client painting their new business.  Personalization in content marketing creates the feeling that your services can&rsquo;t be duplicated. A prospective client will get the notion that this service can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else.</p><h3> 2. Stand apart from the crowd</h3><p> <br/> Using this marketing tool sets your company apart from other competitors. Your brand looks unique and modern for the tech savvy generation.  Consumers share information via internet, cell phones and by talking.</p><h3> 3. Seek feedback</h3><p> <br/> Another tool is to ask a client for feedback via a survey or questionnaire.  This valuable data can help you fine tune products and services.  It shows consumers you care about their experiences with your company and can ultimately   increase loyalty and build relationships.</p><p> Content marketing is fun and easy.

{"original_id":3749,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"2016: 8 Trends Aligned to Work in Your Favor","link":"2016-8-trends-aligned-to-work-in-your-favor","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Taking a step back to understand what lies ahead for financial advisors and the industry as a whole <br/>  </h3><p> What a year! With 2015 almost in the books, it&rsquo;s time yet again to reflect upon the past 12 months and consider where we are headed in 2016.</p><p> 2015 was indeed a news-filled and somewhat scary year on the world&rsquo;s stage, starting and ending with terrorist attacks in Paris, and in between a nuclear deal reached with Iran, a migrant crisis in Europe and a Russian passenger plane crash in Syria. From an industry perspective though, it was an exciting year with far more positive notes as we watched some of the top financial advisor teams in the industry make moves.</p><h3> 2015 Theme of the Year: The Great Migration of the Whales <br/>  </h3><p> With so many multi-billion dollar advisors changing jerseys in the past 12 months, 2015 may very well be known best for  &ldquo;The Great Migration of the Whales&rdquo; . Some of the highlights of these headline-making moves include:</p><li> $6.5B Stephans, Van Liew and Oiler jumped from Merrill Lynch to Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s Graystone Consulting unit</li><li> $3B Chris Mahoney team moved from Merrill Lynch to Raymond James</li><li> $3B Dave LaPlaca transitioned out of Deutsche Bank to independence with Dynasty Financial Partners</li><li> $1B Dagny Maidman moved from Credit Suisse to First Republic Bank&rsquo;s wealth management unit</li><p> Where the majority of the &ldquo;whales&rdquo; went is most noteworthy. Sure, many advisors jumped from one wirehouse to another but, from my perspective, there were 3 standout winners in the race for top talent this year: Raymond James, First Republic Bank and independence in all of its forms.</p><p> It felt like almost every day we saw another press release from RayJay announcing the recruitment of another top advisor. The firm has really solidified its place on the main stage and become a legitimate landing pad for high quality advisors across the country.</p><p> First Republic caught our attention in 2012 when they acquired the $5B+ RIA, Luminous Capital, and yet again only a few months ago when they purchased a second $6B+ RIA: Constellation Wealth Management. The bank&rsquo;s wealth management unit seems to be on an acquisition and recruiting tear and Bob Thornton, the unit&rsquo;s President, tells me that their pipeline is bursting at the seams with some of the industry&rsquo;s best and most productive talent.</p><p> And then we look at the independent space. To call it independence has become a misnomer because an entire cottage industry has been born to support a new generation of entrepreneurs. By my calculations, there were 19 deals done this year alone by just 4 of the top firms in the space, recruiting advisors who individually managed more than $250mm in AUM: 6 by Dynasty, 5 by HighTower, 6 by Focus Financial, and 2 by Robby Stephens. And I&rsquo;m not even counting deals done by William Blair, Snowden Lane, and advisors who went directly to the custodians.</p><h3> 2016: It may very well be &ldquo;The Year of the Advisor&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> The events of 2015 set the stage for what looks to be a strong and active coming new year for all advisors. It&rsquo;s not often that we see so much activity this late in the year, but many advisors are seeing the writing on the wall: the firms they once knew have been sold or are in the process, and the &ldquo;job&rdquo; they once had looks nothing like it did. And that&rsquo;s OK, because one thing is for sure: opportunity abounds! And advisors are no longer waiting for the next shoe to drop; they&rsquo;ve learned that their fate rests in their own hands, so they&rsquo;re exploring their options.</p><p> To be sure, here is our forecast for 2016, which is likely to be deemed  &ldquo;The Year of the Advisor&rdquo; .</p><li> <strong>  Big Bucks from the Wirehouses </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s likely that transition packages offered by the wirehouses will remain at high watermarks because increased competition for top talent from non-core players will force them to pay big money if they want to have any shot with the advisors they most covet.</li><li> <strong>  Free Agents Shop Around </strong> <br/> With more than 7,000 advisors entering free agency in early 2016 as their retention packages forgive, the wirehouses will be particularly vulnerable to attrition. Add on a greatly expanded industry landscape and the independent space becoming such a viable option for top-of-the-food-chain-folks, you can bet that senior leaders and branch managers at these firms are plenty worried.</li><li> <strong>  Big Brother Tightens the Reigns </strong> <br/> The changing regulatory environment will likely force the big firms to become increasingly hyper-vigilant and manage even more to the lowest common denominator. And the exceptions and &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; arrangements regularly made to keep the most productive advisors happy will become much less routine.</li><li> <strong>  IBD Shake-Up </strong> <br/> Regulatory pressures will force more contraction in the independent broker-dealer (IBD) space.   The firms with scale will thrive, but those not able to invest significantly will fall prey to an increasingly discerning advisor force who expects cutting edge technology and greater support. Advisors who practice under IBD umbrellas that have decent books of business will have their pick of the litter in terms of where they can go: to bigger and better B-Ds, to the RIA/hybrid space, or even back to W-2 land.</li><li> <strong>  Buying Spree </strong> <br/> There will be more mergers and acquisitions in the RIA space as it will be harder and more expensive for a standalone firm to remain relevant and profitable. And as the advisor population rapidly ages, we expect to see more succession-driven transactions than ever before. There is no shortage of acquirers as these folks are optimistic about their businesses and know that paying top dollar for an annuitized revenue stream is a smart and strategic endeavor. Banks will be especially acquisitive, as they want in on the action.</li><li> <strong>  RIAs vs Robos </strong></li><p> In the RIA space, there will be a shift towards wealth management and financial planning, and away from pure-play portfolio managers as robo-advising increases competition and drives prices down even further.</p><li> <strong>  The Declaration of Independence </strong> <br/> More wirehouse talent will join the migration to the independent space. And, it will continue to be top-of-the-food-chain folks who will lead the way. Up until relatively recently, it was only the advisors that were bitten by the bug of entrepreneurship, but now senior leaders and branch managers want in on the action too, and are looking to &ldquo;skate where the puck is heading.&rdquo; As a result, we will see a number of new firms born offering a combination of cash and equity plus turnkey support to entice would-be breakaway advisors. This will mean that the trailblazers in the independent space &ndash; like HighTower, Focus, and Dynasty &ndash; will need to really up their game. No doubt, these firms are deep in the lab coming up with creative ways to retain their reputation as the go-to destination for top talent.</li><li> <strong>  Quality of Life </strong> <br/> Advisors value freedom, flexibility, and control more than anything else. Conversely, nothing frustrates them more than being limited in some way and having to deal with nonsensical bureaucracy. Firms like Raymond James (who has had banner years from a recruiting perspective) offer much less aggressive transition packages than their wirehouse competitors. Their success is explained by the fact that advisors fall in love with the firm&rsquo;s culture and commitment to putting them and their clients first, and shareholders a distant second&mdash;so they are willing to forego some short-term upside in return for a better quality of professional life. <br/>  </li><p> Understanding where we&rsquo;ve been &ndash; with some forethought on what lies ahead &ndash; will allow you to sort the noise from the news. So head into 2016 knowing that the balance of power still rests with you, the advisor, and the opportunity to create the business life of your dreams is well within reach.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 21:44:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 21:44:03.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_9Xkpsry.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/2016-8-trends-aligned-to-work-in-your-favor/\", \"post_id\": \"8259\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 21:44:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 21:44:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"2016-8-trends-aligned-to-work-in-your-favor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8258\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3881\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Trends-Aligned-to-Work-in-Your-Favor-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"680\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451458800,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

At some point either everyone gets a time out, or frustration overflows and it gets physical. They are just not equipped to handle their emotions like&mdash;ahem&mdash;adults.</p><p> Change the scene: Capital Hill. The acrimony between opposing parties has been raised to new levels. The result is a gridlock that is in the best interest of no one. Each party&rsquo;s agenda seemingly leaves no room for discussion, negotiation or anything that helps our government function. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;time out&rdquo; space in Washington DC.</p><p> Leaving the rest of us to, if you&rsquo;ll excuse the expression, suck wind.</p><p> But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to like it or that we have to sit on our hands and do nothing.</p><p> Tax changes WILL happen, in one form or another, but they won&rsquo;t be the sweeping reform necessary to fix a broken system that&rsquo;s been patched by the ill-equipped, uninformed and unrepentant actors on the Hill.</p><p> So what to do? </p><p> Tread lightly. There seems to be a clear urgency on the part of some &ldquo;experts&rdquo; to get in under the wire, to create a significant tax strategy or make drastic changes based on the speculation of changes to come. Just remember, it&rsquo;s you (or your heirs) who will have to live with the consequences of those actions</p><p> We saw this very clearly when everyone expected Congress to lower the Estate Tax limit threshold from $5 million back to $1 million. This belief led attorneys to devote countless hours trying to pump out documents, creating significant costs to clients that all became meaningless when Congress did nothing.</p><p> Planning isn&rsquo;t bad&mdash;on the contrary, planning is important when there is enough real information to make appropriate moves. Over planning and speculative planning typically have a whipsaw effect that hurts far more than it helps. Remember the tax shelter days of huge write offs that became even bigger tax bills and phantom income? What about tax strategies based on Private Letter Rulings that are later disallowed?</p><p> Unlike three-year olds (or legislators), we need to use a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; test when making financial decisions, most especially where taxes are involved.</p><p> <strong>  Ask questions. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t rely on anyone&rsquo;s opinion or speculation and that includes your professional advisors. Make them put their recommendation in writing and provide a reasonable level of expectation.</p><p> <strong>  Make sure you fully understand what&rsquo;s being recommended. </strong>  Whether we&rsquo;re talking tax strategies, insurance policies or investments, any true expert should be able to walk you through technical issues in plain language.</p><p> <strong>  Adopt a &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the worst case scenario&rdquo; thinking. </strong> Once you understand the worst case, you can make a better decision on what&rsquo;s a reasonable risk to you.</p><p> <strong>  Vote with your feet. </strong>  If your advisor isn&rsquo;t making the information useable based on your level of knowledge, it&rsquo;s time to find a new advisor.</p><p> <strong>  Engage in discussion. </strong> Our strategies and financial decisions should be aligned with your values and what is most important in your life. Make sure your financial team understands what you care most about.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t let the tax tail wag the dog. </strong>  No one likes paying taxes and it&rsquo;s our right to pay the least the law allows. Just know that when you make decisions motivated by tax savings, the consequences might be too costly. For example, tax loss harvesting&mdash;where you sell assets to offset gains&mdash;is a common strategy for investors. But it also means you cannot re-buy those securities for 31 days. Sometimes, the risk associated with selling (trade costs and the risk of being out of the market) is greater than saving a few dollars, especially when you&rsquo;re in a lower tax bracket.</p><p> Yes, it is guess work because you cannot know what you don&rsquo;t know. Adding to the degree of confusion is the speculation, analysis and &ldquo;punditization&rdquo; that drive newsletter sales and endless debate, normally amounting to nothing.</p><p> When it comes to prudent tax planning, the farther out the ramification of your decision goes, the more likely an unanticipated outcome will occur. Tread lightly.

Three Marketing Lessons for Financial Services From the Tech Sector","link":"disrupt-or-die-three-marketing-lessons-for-financial-services-from-the-tech-sector-2","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Disrupt or die? Which side of the digital tsunami is your brand or employer on? It may not be a straight yes/no answer. But if you&rsquo;re not surfing the wave(s) you&rsquo;re facing a real risk of wipe-out. Literally.</p><p> Why? Evidence, analysis and data all suggest it&rsquo;s soon to &ldquo;disrupt or be disrupted&rdquo;.</p><p> So what should CMOs and CEOs in financial services do when faced with the wave?</p><p> Learn from those who created it, and stay on there right side of it.</p><p> The top three marketing strategies used by disruptors that we see as more mature players:</p><p> <strong>  1. Influencer marketing (think ANZ&rsquo;s current &lsquo;Your world, your way&rsquo;)  <br/>  2. Social CRM (it&rsquo;s smart but creepy that my bank tweets back at me now)  <br/>  3. Challenger brand strategy (RaboDirect beats up the big banks) </strong></p><p> Whether you think social is a no brainer or high risk/low return channel (yes, plenty of people in our industry think the latter) the evidence is now overwhelming.. What&rsquo;s more interesting than the business case is &ldquo;how&rdquo; mature businesses are mimicking.</p><p> The latest KPMG report titled Unlocking the potential: The fintech opportunity for Sydney, reminds us tomorrow&rsquo;s customer will be more demanding, less loyal to their financial institution and characterised by a desire for immediate, transparent and personalised service. That kind of service will be powered by technology and social media marketing.</p><p> <strong>  1. Influencer marketing: </strong>  Just as Uber launched at SxSW &hellip; so too are banks and FS businesses going after influencers. Not so new, not so novel but all &ldquo;shiny object&rdquo; powered by social media networks and specifically the power of influencer networks. Take Jeff Bullas, Kim Kardashian or Warren Buffet. We know a tweet from Kim is worth $15K to a sponsor. What&rsquo;s the value of 250,000 new signs ups in a week to you? Someone with the power to deliver it to you can probably tell you what it&rsquo;s worth to them. They charge you. Call it blogger relations at its most basic, thought leadership marketing in a traditional asset management sense or experimental marketing to consumer opinion leaders, effective influencer marketing can create great visibility for your product or service as long as you&rsquo;re also great at service delivery.</p><p> Here in Australia Uber conducted a slightly different influencer campaign, not with an influencer but with kittens. Uber launched #UberKittens where customers could order a kitten car and for $40 a kitten (along with a handler) would come and play with you for 15 minutes. The internet loves cats and who wouldn&rsquo;t want to share a selfie with a kitten? This campaign shows Uber&rsquo;s ability to use popular culture to generate social buzz and engage with what their customers are talking about.</p><p> <a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/file-3455956047-jpg/blog-files/cat.jpg?t=1450826319401\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"cat\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/file-3455956047-jpg/blog-files/cat.jpg?t=1450826319401&amp;width=680&amp;height=296\"/> </a> <br/> Source: http://www.cnet.com/au/news/uber-for-cats-uber-kittens-hits-australia-for-one-day-only/</p><p> Taking a look at financial services, ANZ&rsquo;s recent &lsquo;Your world, your way&rsquo; campaign &ndash; aimed to empower and to encourage people to follow their dreams. You too can be as cool as the founder of ATARI Nolan Bushmell, or as adventurous and determined as sailor Jessica Watson. Different to Uber&rsquo;s direct approach, the ANZ influencer campaign uses opinion leaders or well-known people to tell us anything is achievable &ndash; our way.</p><p> <strong>  2. Social CRM:  </strong> customer relationships management, as cited in Temenos&rsquo; &lsquo;Lessons learned from Banking industry disruptors&rsquo; report, is using social media and big data to help firms to get a clearer picture of their customers&rsquo; lives. In doing so, it allowed them to determine customers&rsquo; creditworthiness &ndash; leading to better pricing and well informed online relationship management (also known as social CRM). Through CRM companies are able to better understand their customers and in turn hyper-personalise the user experience.</p><p> German bank, Fidor Bank, has embraced social media and interaction throughout its business model. Using social media Fidor Bank not only speak with customers but also consult with customers when developing new products and provide a space for peer-to-peer online forums. Last but not least, Fidor Bank pays increased interest on certain accounts for customers who are fans of the bank on Facebook. That&rsquo;s a good incentive if I&rsquo;ve ever heard one!</p><p> National Australia Bank (NAB) also saw the need to embrace social and in 2012 opened its &lsquo;social media command centre&rsquo;. The team of seven &ndash; drawn from the bank&rsquo;s marketing, digital and corporate affairs divisions &ndash; was tasked with managing the 5000+ social media interactions per month. NAB&rsquo;s seven day a week service enabled its social media community to grow by more than 350% in 2012, with content reaching over 12 million users. NAB&rsquo;s early adaption to social CRM has allowed it to outperform its competitors and gain greater insights into their behaviour patterns, wants and needs.

Challenger brand strategy: </strong>  disrupting the disruptors: Challenger brand marketing is just as it sounds. Non-dominant brands overturning and undermining the status-quo through innovative marketing that connects with the customer.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a step back to 2011 when RaboDirect launched their attack on the big four banks. What were the big 4 doing? According to RaboDirect they were stealing people&rsquo;s dreams through low interest saving accounts. RaboDirect represented the big four as enjoying your holiday, buying your diamond ring and even buying your daughter&rsquo;s pony. Comical, and without directly shaming another, the campaign called for customers to act in a bid to steal back their dreams from the bank.</p><p> <img alt=\"rabo\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/file-3455956067-jpg/blog-files/rabo.jpg?t=1450826319401&amp;width=429&amp;height=548\"/> <br/> Source: http://www.adnews.com.au/campaign/stealing-your-dreams</p><p> Like RaboDirect&rsquo;s &lsquo;stealing your dreams&rsquo; campaign, the Commonwealth Bank&rsquo;s (CBA) &lsquo;CAN&rsquo; campaign aimed to show customers what they were missing.

{"original_id":3752,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Purchasing Email Lists For Your Business? Here's How to Increase Your Responses","link":"purchasing-email-lists-for-your-business-heres-how-to-increase-your-responses","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> For B2B companies that want to produce more sales and engagement, effective email marketing campaigns can offer a platform for success. Purchasing email lists offers a much faster alternative to gradually building a list over time.  <strong>  But finding an email list that&rsquo;s clean and open to your messages can be difficult. So can crafting that perfect message. </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re going to conduct a successful email marketing campaign to a purchased list, it&rsquo;s important to master the basics and avoid common mistakes. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s easy to avoid these mistakes and create a email campaign your target audience will be receptive to.</p><p> Here are 7 tips your business can use to increase responses from purchased email lists.</p><h3> Tip #1: Find a Service you Love <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re purchasing email lists, you might not be able to use popular email services </strong>  like MailChimp, Constant Contact, or Active Campaign to create and send your message. Be sure to check your email vendor&rsquo;s terms of service before sending your campaign.  <strong>  Some email providers don&rsquo;t allow you to send to email addresses that you bought.  </strong> Consider a self-hosted service like Interspire Email Marketer or Sendy.</p><h3> Tip #2: Buy, Don&rsquo;t Rent <br/>  </h3><p> Make sure you buy a list rather than sending to a rented list. For example, some professional associations rent their mailing lists, but there are disadvantages to this approach:</p><li> A third party sends the email for you, so you don&rsquo;t have as much control.</li><li> You rent the addresses, so it doesn&rsquo;t allow you to build your master list. <br/>  </li><h3> You shouldn&rsquo;t rely on purchased email lists for all of your business development efforts. <br/>  </h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/5-proven-components-of-a-b2b-lead-generation-campaign\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn how to generate new business using your website  </a> </u></p><h3> Tip #3: Clean Your List Ahead of Time <br/>  </h3><p> You might also want to set aside some budget for list cleansing before you hit send. Using a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pardot.com/blog/email-lists-sparkling-clean/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   list cleaning service  </a> </u>  like Impressionwise or LeadSpend before sending your first email will clean out the spammy or dead email addresses.</p><h3> Tip #4: Purchase a Large List <br/>  </h3><p> Some data companies will offer bulk discounts, and it&rsquo;s wise for marketers who are getting started with purchasing email lists to buy a large list of at least a few thousand contacts. Open rates will be lower than your &ldquo;house&rdquo; list, and click rates will usually be in the single digits. You&rsquo;ll want the larger list so that you get several good responses.  <strong>  Hint: if you track response metrics, you can work backwards from the number of contacts you need to determine list size based on historical open rates, click rates and conversion rates. </strong></p><h3> Tip #5: Know The Legal Considerations <br/>  </h3><p> Because of CASL legislation, you can&rsquo;t send cold emails to prospects in Canada, but you can legally email people in the United States. Just be sure you adhere to CAN-SPAM legislation here in the States by including an unsubscribe link in all your emails. This isn&rsquo;t meant to be legal advice, so consult your attorney if you have specific questions.</p><h3> Tip #6: Give &lsquo;Em What They Want <br/>  </h3><p> Rather than sending promotional messages and heavy sales pitches, give the recipient information they can use.  <strong>  We&rsquo;ve found that emailing content offers like a guide can improve your response rate significantly.  </strong> Avoid:</p><li> Information about how long you&rsquo;ve been in business</li><li> Long narratives about your products or what services you provide</li><li> Asking for the sale without first providing helpful information</li><li> Information that&rsquo;s too general or not relevant to their industry <br/>  </li><h3> Tip #7: Send, Resend, Repeat <br/>  </h3><p> The average email campaign is only opened by 20-30% of the audience. As you continue to send direct email to your audience, however, you can weed out non-responsive contacts. We&rsquo;d also encourage you to  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ab-testing-email-campaigns/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   run some A/B testing  </a> </u>  to improve your open rate and click rate.</p><p> Purchasing email lists can be an effective way to grow your list and provide business development opportunities, but it should just be part of your marketing mix. Eventually, your contacts will find their way back to your website. Will they find information that will further the sale?</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 22:02:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 22:02:04.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_LjudOXg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/purchasing-email-lists-for-your-business-heres-how-to-increase-your-responses/\", \"post_id\": \"8263\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 22:02:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 22:02:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"purchasing-email-lists-for-your-business-heres-how-to-increase-your-responses\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8260\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3884\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Toddlers-Wild-Speculation-and-Taxes-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"520\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451397600,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3753,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Become the Best...","link":"how-to-become-the-best","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of my millennial friends, Vince, recently posted this on Facebook.</p><p> &ldquo;I may not be the best organist, and yes, I play it like a piano. But I am determined to learn the Tocatta part of Tocatta and Fugue in D minor down for Saturday for a tour group I am playing for.&rdquo;</p><p> The rush of comments seemed to entirely miss the point. &ldquo;You worry too much.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are a great pianist.&rdquo; For a little extra inspiration while you read on click here:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9rZjlsyYY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor  </a> </u> .</p><p> No one becomes the &ldquo;best organist&rdquo; without hours and hours&hellip;and hours&hellip;spent obsessing over and replaying the difficult runs. His comment showed that he was well on his way to becoming the best he could be. If you&rsquo;re looking to become the best _______ (insert your audacious goal here,) follow Vince&rsquo;s example.</p><h3> 4 Vital Factors to Becoming the Best __________ <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Take an Honest Assessment of Where You Are </strong></p><p> Notice that Vince&rsquo;s words had nothing to do with talent (which would imply finite potential). I&rsquo;ve heard Vince play. In fact I&rsquo;ve sung with him on more than one occasion. He&rsquo;s solid. And, clearly someone he respects has told him he plays the organ like the piano&hellip; for now. And he&rsquo;s listening. The best way to become the best is to have a clear view of where you stand and what you need to improve.</p><p> <strong>  2. Accept Challenges that Feel Slightly Out of Reach </strong></p><p> The only way to become better each day, is to take on the hard challenges that make your brain hurt and require you to stretch yourself to achieve them. The people at the top of their fields don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not ready for that.&rdquo; Instead they take a deep breath and say, &ldquo;Game on.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  3. Work Your Butt Off </strong></p><p> More than talent, truly successful people schlog many long hours perfecting their craft. They&rsquo;re up early and work late.  They don&rsquo;t watch much TV. If it takes 37 times to get one measure right, they play it 38 times just in case. The fastest runners have logged the miles. The best writers write every day. Whenever I start wishing that I could write like  <u>  Seth Godin </u> , I remind myself that he&rsquo;s written 10x more blog posts than I have, and keep writing.</p><p> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t Wait Until You&rsquo;re Perfect to Perform </strong></p><p> One of my best friends is a brilliant writer, but as Seth would say, she seldom &ldquo;ships her art.&rdquo; She talks herself out of the blog posts or book chapters mid-way through. No one expects perfection, they want to hear your voice.</p><p> If you want to be the best ______ get out there and do it, surround yourself with supportive hearts, pay attention to what works, and enjoy the ride.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 22:10:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 22:10:15.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_DQua21S.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-become-the-best/\", \"post_id\": \"8265\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 22:10:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 22:10:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-become-the-best\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8264\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3885\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Become-the-Best....jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"323\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451401200,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

Even dating is on hyper speed, thanks to mobile apps that simplify the search for romance down to the swipe of a finger. Technology, business, and subsequently, life, are hurtling full speed ahead&mdash;blink, and you might miss something.But when it comes to connecting with your audience through social media, you just might want to tap the breaks. In the race to build relationships online, a slower pace is pertinent. Maintaining those relationships is a marathon, not a sprint, and taking it slow with your audience is the way to win.</p><h3> Making The Connection</h3>Look, learn, and listen&mdash;the first steps in cultivating an online relationship.<strong> &ldquo;Look them in the eyes digitally,&rdquo;</strong>advises author and former chief social marketing officer Ted Rubin in an interview with the <u> <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/relationship-marketing-with-ted-rubin/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Social Media Marketing podcast </a></u>. This means checking out your target&rsquo;s profile, learning something about them, and utilizing their name in conversation to show that you are invested in building a connection. This brings us to the next point&hellip;<h3> Give, Then Get</h3>Like any relationship, what you put in is what you get out of it. Did you know that shouting from the rooftops on social and telling people to buy your brand has the lowest return on engagement? The key is to make sure you are giving before asking for something by first connecting with them in a way that makes them feel special. While it might seem time consuming, making this effort will go a long way and will ultimately yield a valuable ROR&mdash;return on relationship.

Insightpool CEO Devon Wijesinghe demonstrates the impact of opening a conversation with true contextual relevance through a real-life success story in his post, <u> <a href=\"https://insightpool.com/rethink-social-in-social-selling/#sthash.WcpDljb4.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Rethink &ldquo;Social&rdquo; in Social Selling </a></u>.

{"original_id":3755,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Flirting Ever Ethical in Sales?","link":"is-flirting-ever-ethical-in-sales","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hello_itsdeb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Debra Carpenter  </u> </a> | <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   HireVue  </u> </a> In a previous article, we explored  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sexism in the sales industry  </a> </u> . That article generated a lot of discussion. Perhaps this article on flirting in sales will generate a lively debate also.According to John Nelson, a well-known sale coach: \"Sex will always play a part in women's sales to men.\" This article is my attempt to bring light to this controversial topic; I take no sides, but want to simply declare that there's the proverbial elephant in the room. <u>  Salespeople </u>  employ various tactics in order to sell to their prospects. Some of those tactics are straightforward--talking about the advantages of using your product, for example--while others are more subtle and might rely on manipulating the unaware prospects' mental state at the time of negotiation.Flirting falls under the latter category, and for this reason, many in the industry regard it as an unethical sales tactic.But  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2012/08/02/flirt-office/\" target=\"_blank\">   studies  </a> </u>  have shown that men do respond positively (that is, they tend to buy more often) when a saleswoman openly flirts with them as opposed to just being friendly, professional, and straightforward.Effective, yes, but is flirting in sales ever ethical?</p><h3> The Great Divide</h3>It seems as though there are two schools of thought here:The first is that flirting in business is unethical, regardless of the effectiveness. To those in this school of thought, employing feminine wiles and charm for professional gain is immoral, degrading, and serves only to perpetuate antiquated gender stereotypes.The second school of thought is that occasional flirting enables a woman to <u> sell more</u> and feel empowered in the process. They see it as a smart sales tactic, not an unethical business practice.So, how can we explore a behavior as complex as flirtation and judge its' merits and negative consequences in the workplace?First, we should define what, to most of us, actually constitutes flirting.<h3> I Know It When I See It</h3>Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said, in reference to the difficulty of operationally defining pornography, \"I know it when I see it.\"That's a sentiment most of us can agree with. It's hard to concretely define flirting because we all employ different behaviors to signal to another person that we're attracted to them. Another difficulty is that flirting and friendliness resemble each other quite closely.However, psychologists have identified a few behaviors as inherently \"flirtatious.\" Take a look:<h3> Body Language</h3>Like Olivia Newton John sang, \"Let me hear your body talk.\" Smiling, being playful, leaning forward, standing close to or touching someone you don't know well, and making prolonged eye contact are all behaviors that can signal romantic interest, even when that's not the intention.Simply being perceived as an attractive woman can cause the receiving party to <u> <a href=\"http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/14/9426089-the-hotter-the-woman-the-better-men-think-chances-are\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  construe even innocent actions as flirtatious </a></u>. This is when it becomes important to know what behaviors others consider flirtatious cues so you can adjust your pitches and casual conversations accordingly.<h3> Verbal Cues</h3>The words you speak to a client, supervisor, or coworker can come across as professional and friendly or flirtatious, depending on the context and subject matter.Studies have found that giving compliments, referencing your romantic availability, and using sexual innuendo are usually interpreted as flirty behavior by both men and women.Playful banter is more ambiguous, meaning some people will interpret it as flirting, while others see it as friendly behavior.Sticking to \"safe\", impersonal topics (weather, news, industry topics, etc.) can ensure you don't cross any lines, but could also stifle a natural connection from growing between you and your client.<h3> Flirting Styles</h3>Not everyone employs the stereotypical flirting behaviors when trying to land a sale (or a partner). <u> <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201408/how-spot-flirt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  One study </a></u> defined 5 general flirting styles:Traditional flirtUsually introverted, people who use this style are likely to take it slow and flirt only in \"acceptable\" scenarios--at the bar, a party, or at school. They aren't pushy, but have no issues conveying their interest to someone.Playful flirtThe playful flirt is usually extroverted, and unlike the traditional flirt, no setting is off-limits for signaling their romantic interest. This is probably the type you imagine when you picture a \"stereotypical flirt.\" Sometimes, the flirtation is sincere and sometimes it's out of habit or in pursuit of a goal.Physical flirtPhysical flirts rely heavily on body language to show their romantic interest. These types are likely to touch you during conversation, hug you as a greeting and send-off, and make prolonged eye contact.Sincere flirt and polite flirtSincere flirts and polite flirts are two different types, but share many characteristics. Both prefer to be introduced to the object of their interest and don't usually relish approaching someone, even in a setting where flirting is socially accepted. They seek to make the other party as comfortable as possible when flirting.<h3> A Fine Line</h3>In a sense, every time a woman communicates with a man in the workplace, she's walking a fine line between being perceived as flirty or friendly.We've seen that there are clear benefits to flirting in sales (i.e., more sales and promotions), but there can also be heavy drawbacks.In fact, David Nour, author of Relationship Economics, maintains that \"Flirting at work is simply dangerous and very career limiting.\"How so? Reasons might include misinterpretation of interest, awkward situations with the other party, and erosion of trust between the parties, not to mention the professional restrictions and a <u> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/07/14/when-flirting-goes-wrong-sex-seduction-erotic-capital/#7d5641e3d8cc\" target=\"_blank\">  negative reputation </a></u> that could follow you throughout your career.This is why many women in sales choose to avoid flirtation as a sales tactic altogether. They don't want to be seen as a woman who is successful solely because of her charm, appeal, and beauty, but rather as a smart, capable person who is deeply knowledgeable about their product or service.<h3> Active Listening</h3>So, how can you stand out if flirting isn't acceptable? Many salespeople rely on active listening skills to develop and deepen connections with clients and prospects.Active listening is a method of communication that involves the listener restating or paraphrasing what the speaker has said, along with offering nonverbal cues of understanding and interest, like smiling, nodding, making appropriate eye contact, and slightly leaning toward the speaker.Notice any similarities between active listening and flirting?If you did, that&rsquo;s because a driving component of flirting is communicating interest, just as with active listening. People enjoy feeling that others are interested in what they have to say, and this is part of the reason flirtation is so flattering to many of us. It's also why active listening works.But while flirting may connote that you are interested for sexual reasons, active listening simply reinforces that you are genuinely following what the speaker has communicated and are interested in hearing more.<h3> The Ethical Approach</h3>It may be beneficial to glean a few positive, socially accepted behaviors from the so-called flirting handbook and combine them with traits of active listening to ensure there is no miscommunication or awkwardness when interfacing with a client, higher-up, or colleague.For example, many women in sales would be wary of touching a male client's arm, smiling, and leaning forward during conversation because it would almost certainly be interpreted as flirting and could convey or misrepresent an intention they don't really have. That spells trouble.A better way to approach it: Try focusing on what your prospect is saying and conveying your interest and understanding by nodding, making eye contact in appropriate intervals, paraphrasing what they&rsquo;ve communicated to you, and smiling to reinforce your interest. These are all indicators that you are actively listening and understanding their points.This way, you're making a personal connection, showing understanding, and showcasing your friendliness without crossing boundaries or appearing unprofessional.<h3> It's Your Call</h3>With all this being said, it&rsquo;s important to remember that your own beliefs should guide your communication with others in the workplace. If flirting in business seems unethical to you, or if a prospect, colleague, or client ever makes you feel uncomfortable, you are responsible for speaking up and steering the communication in a direction you feel more comfortable with.Sometimes, that might mean severing ties with a client or losing a sale because you weren&rsquo;t willing to play the flirtation game with a prospect. In cases like those, you probably won&rsquo;t be full of regret after making the call&mdash;rather, you&rsquo;ll feel instantaneous relief.That&rsquo;s the best indicator of what is ethical in the sales world and what is not: Your own feelings. Trust your gut and remember to employ active listening behaviors to ensure those you work with see you as a professional, savvy, and successful salesperson instead of a potential date.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 22:28:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 22:28:58.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_SYfaI02.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-flirting-ever-ethical-in-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"8268\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 22:28:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 22:28:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-flirting-ever-ethical-in-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8266\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3887\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Building-Social-Relationships-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1692\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451395800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

For others, it appears in a flash, as if during some particular instant &ldquo;it&rdquo; decided this was the moment to appear. Although disguised as a purpose, I call the latter passion&mdash;a love you develop for something you experienced  since  the time you were born.</p><p> For most, however, it&rsquo;s thought to be evasive. Evasive, though, would be incorrect because more than likely it&rsquo;s simply being ignored. What is it? It&rsquo;s your purpose. How can you find it? Just pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening to you. You can also breeze through this article on how to figure out your purpose in life in fewer than 600 words.</p><p> As a recruiter, although more often serving as a therapist, I get asked this question daily. People want to know, &ldquo;How can I figure out what to do?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my purpose?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What should I do with my life?&rdquo; They ask as if I have a menu of options they can choose from. Although I don&rsquo;t, there are some thought-provoking ways to help you determine this. Let&rsquo;s try a few.</p><p> <strong>  What do you do when you procrastinate? </strong></p><p> When someone isn&rsquo;t sure what he or she&rsquo;d like to do with his or her life, I ask this question. In 80% of the cases, I&rsquo;m certain these individuals can turn their &ldquo;hobbies&rdquo; into their professions AND earn a nice living. I know many say that their hobby wouldn&rsquo;t be fun once they have to do it. I don&rsquo;t buy that. Assuming you&rsquo;re not delaying your life by playing video games, give this one a good, long thought.</p><p> <strong>  What can&rsquo;t you go one entire day without thinking about? </strong></p><p> For myself, I use this one often to determine whether I need to quit something. The opposite also works. It&rsquo;s a wonderful, daily inspiration of what you should pursue or continue to pursue. If you ignore it, it&rsquo;ll likely serve as a perpetual reminder that you&rsquo;re missing your calling.</p><p> <strong>  If money were no object, what would you do? </strong></p><p> When you look back on your life, I promise you&rsquo;ll be more sorry for the times you missed than the dollars you missed. Money is fungible, memories are not and can last a lifetime. I&rsquo;m sure a few of you reading this are still dismayed at the IPOs you missed, but over a 40- or 50-year career you&rsquo;ll be shaped far more by what you do than what you earn.</p><p> <strong>  What do you want to be most remembered for? </strong></p><p> I constantly work backwards. I sketch the end result I want. This helps provide clarity and is also tremendously helpful in keeping your focus. I used the word sketchinstead of something more rigid because I think you need to have a vision, but also leave room to recognize alterations you&rsquo;ll need to make along the way. I assure you, if you head down a path where you are doing something you love each and every day, fantastic opportunities will surface as a result of your attitude, alertness, and proficiency in which you perform whatever it is you&rsquo;re doing.</p><p> <strong>  When during your life were your head and heart most in sync? </strong></p><p> I know of no more powerful force than an individual who&rsquo;s entire being is in sync. The alignment between what you think, how you think, and the passion in which you carry it out is unstoppable. Throughout you&rsquo;re life, you&rsquo;ll be stopped more often by yourself than others. Don&rsquo;t let anyone dictate your outcomes. Most importantly, stay true to who you are.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-28 22:48:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-28 22:48:07.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_Nc2jyVu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-figure-out-your-purpose-in-life-in-fewer-than-600-words/\", \"post_id\": \"8274\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-28 22:48:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-28 22:48:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-figure-out-your-purpose-in-life-in-fewer-than-600-words\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8273\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3890\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Figure-Out-Your-Purpose-in-Life-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"833\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451420100,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3760,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Turn Every Client Meeting Into a Wow Experience","link":"how-to-turn-every-client-meeting-into-a-wow-experience","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A Missed Opportunity <br/>  </h3><p> I advised one of my clients to hold regular &ldquo;agenda-setting&rdquo; meetings with an organization they were working with. &ldquo;But Andrew,&rdquo; they told me, &ldquo;we tried that. We set up a quarterly review session attended by representatives of key functions in the business. But after the first couple of meetings, many of them stopped coming and began making excuses about being too busy. They started sending a junior team member, and the session lost its effectiveness. It hasn&rsquo;t worked.&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, this was a huge, missed opportunity. Here&rsquo;s what went wrong, and how to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen to you.</p><p> Your client meetings are a precious asset. When you&rsquo;re face to face with the executives you work with, it&rsquo;s a chance to add value, learn more about their concerns, and influence their attitudes towards you. Your competitors, in fact, would kill for the access you have.</p><p> But many professionals simply don&rsquo;t maximize the value and impact of their meetings. They don&rsquo;t create a great client experience that leaves the participants thirsting for more.</p><p> When this happens, executives shift their priorities and use the time you wanted with them for some other, higher-value purpose. They delegate or just don&rsquo;t show up.</p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s a regular steering committee review of progress on a large project, or just a short update to present some findings, ask yourself these questions: Does your client walk away thinking, &ldquo;That was a great use of my time&mdash;I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the next time we meet&rdquo;?  Do they leave feeling like it was an invigorating, even &ldquo;wow&rdquo; experience? Or are they thinking about delegating their attendance to a subordinate for the next go-around?</p><p> Executives sit through meetings all day at work, and many of them are fairly tedious. Your job is to show them something quite different.</p><h3> What Makes for a Great Client Experience? <br/>  </h3><p> There are seven elements of a great client experience. While you may not have all of them present in every meeting, you will certainly want to provide four or five of them.</p><p> <strong>  1. Value. </strong>  This is, of course, at the core of your interactions with clients. They are paying you to deliver value. This can be contractual value around the specific product or service you&rsquo;re delivering, or it can be more general value that helps the client improve their business.</p><p> <strong>  2. Education. </strong>  Clients want to learn from their interactions with you. They want to build their own organizational capabilities. Are you educating as well as informing them? There&rsquo;s a difference between the two. When you educate them you help them understand the why behind your work. You improve their capacity to problem-solve on their own.</p><p> <strong>  3. Engagement. </strong>  Executives get &ldquo;presented to&rdquo; all the time by outside service providers, and they tell me it&rsquo;s often boring and even stultifying. Are you engineering a highly engaging experience that involves active give and take, participation on both sides, and the use of multiple media to communicate?</p><p> <strong>  4. Emotional Resonance. </strong>  A great experience appeals to your heart as well as your head. That&rsquo;s why a trip to Disney World, or a romantic getaway to the Caribbean, can be so memorable. Emotional resonance occurs when people feel they&rsquo;ve connected on a personal, emotional level. This means sharing feelings and personal experiences, using metaphors and analogies in the form of stories, and asking emotional not just rational questions.</p><p> <strong>  5. Collaboration.  </strong> Are your meetings collaborative? Clients&mdash;like you&mdash;don&rsquo;t just want stuff &ldquo;done to them.&rdquo; When clients collaborate with you during both design and delivery, they feel more engaged and committed. You become a team, not arms-length participants in a transaction (or at worst, adversaries).</p><p> <strong>  6. Entertainment.  </strong> Simply put, people learn more when they are having fun. And, if clients perceive your meetings as not just being valuable from a business perspective but also engaging and fun, they will especially look forward to them.</p><p> <strong>  7. Other-Worldly. </strong>  A great experience gets you out of your normal world. When you change the environment, you talk about different things, interact on a more personal level, and get new perspectives on your life back in the office. That&rsquo;s why going offsite for a meeting can be so refreshing. Apple Stores, which are an integral part of Apple&rsquo;s success story, are &ldquo;other-worldly&rdquo; compared to almost any other retailing environment&mdash;and they were designed to be that way. The Genius Bar also puts &ldquo;value&rdquo; at the center of the experience for anyone who has a question or problem with their Apple products.</p><h3> Techniques You Can Use to Invigorate Your Meetings <br/>  </h3><p> Here are some specific practices and ideas you can incorporate into your own meetings to create a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; client experience.</p><p> <strong>  Involve new stakeholders.  </strong> These could be new executives from the client&rsquo;s organization or new people from within your own firm. For example, I once ran a major training initiative for corporate bankers at a large bank. For one of our sessions, we invited members of their credit committee to participate. To the bankers, the credit approval process seemed opaque and troublesome&mdash;they would sometimes agree to a loan with a client, only to have it turned down a few weeks later by the credit committee. This session gave more transparency to the process, and helped improve relationships between the two groups.</p><p> You could, similarly, invite new and different experts&mdash;or even one of your firm leaders&ndash;from your own organization to participate.</p><p> <strong>  Bring new information and data into your meetings. </strong>  You may be used to reporting on a specific project or engagement, using a standard set of data. Think about integrating other types of information that will illuminate your work and provide context. This could have to do with:</p><p> &bull; Markets <br/> &bull; Competitors <br/> &bull; The economy <br/> &bull; Trends that might impact the client and the work you&rsquo;re doing <br/> &bull; Internal best practices <br/> &bull; Etc. <br/>  </p><p> <strong>  Ask better questions. </strong>  One of the best ways to create more emotional resonance is to ask questions that draw out feelings, beliefs, attitudes, fears, as well as the personal implications of changes that are envisioned. For example:</p><p> &bull; &ldquo;How does your team feel about this particular change?&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;What part of the plan are you most concerned with?&rdquo; <br/> &bull; &ldquo;What legacy would you like to leave here when you move on to another part of the company?&rdquo; <br/>  </p><p> <strong>  Collaborate before, during, and after. </strong>  When I first started in consulting, it was the heady days of the early 1980s, and strategy consulting was taking off. There was a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; quality to much of the work we did. We gathered data, analyzed it, and then tried to &ldquo;wow&rdquo; the client with our brilliant insights during largely one-way presentations (&ldquo;here are our conclusions and recommendations&mdash;now go implement them!&rdquo;). Today, clients want to actively participate and collaborate with their external service providers and advisors. This may mean working closely together to prepare for a meeting, jointly presenting, and then planning next steps together.</p><p> <strong>  Use humor and make it fun.  </strong> One of my clients was highly successful at helping corporations roll out and communicate their new strategies to large groups of employees. They often utilized a board game or card game as part of an interactive training session that was actually fun for the participants.</p><p> <strong>  Change the experience environment.  </strong> This can help create the &ldquo;other-worldly&rdquo; part of the experience for your clients.</p><p> <strong>  Use different presentation media.  </strong> Why does every client meeting have to revolve around PowerPoint slides? To engage, create emotional resonance, and generally improve participants&rsquo; recall of the facts you are presenting, use a variety of media in your meetings such as videos, wall charts, placemats, role plays, case studies, etc. Just using pictures in your slides can have an impact&mdash;one study showed that having a photo or illustration on a slide triples people&rsquo;s recall of the data it presents.</p><p> <strong>  Use interactive simulations and exercises.  </strong> One of my clients used to run a computer simulation game to model the impact of different strategies on market share. Another used a risk simulation program for their financial services clients.</p><p> <strong>  Employ more stories and examples.  </strong> Stories, examples, analogies, and metaphors all appeal to our right brains. They touch us on an emotional level. They help us remember. Not surprisingly, great teachers throughout history have used parables and allegories to connect with and engage their students.</p><p> Use these principles and techniques to create a great client experience in every meeting you have. If you do this consistently, clients will look forward to your meetings and feel energized&mdash;rather than enervated&mdash;afterwards. They will say, &ldquo;Working with them really is different.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 20:14:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 20:14:48.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_lz6bbX8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-turn-every-client-meeting-into-a-wow-experience/\", \"post_id\": \"8282\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 20:14:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 20:14:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-turn-every-client-meeting-into-a-wow-experience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8281\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3894\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Turn-Every-Meeting-Into-a-Wow-Experience-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"569\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451545200,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3761,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"RIA Compliance Issues When Charging Fixed, Flat, or Retainer Fees","link":"ria-compliance-issues-when-charging-fixed-flat-or-retainer-fees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a>  </p><p> While the vast majority of registered investment adviser (RIA) firms still charge traditional advisory fees calculated as a percentage of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-calculate-investment-adviser-regulatory-assets-under-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   assets under management  </a> </u>  (e.g. 1% of AUM), a growing number of investment advisory firms are considering implementing an ongoing flat fee structure (e.g. $200 per month). The concept of charging a fixed or subscription fee has been around for quite some time, but as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/when-and-when-not-to-work-with-an-ria-compliance-consultant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA compliance consultants  </a> </u> , we have seen new variations on the fixed fee model emerge. As such, we wanted to offer some general compliance thoughts and considerations for RIA firms looking to charge a fixed fee.</p><h3> Categorizing the Types of Fixed Fees that RIA Firms May Charge <br/>  </h3><p> To set the stage, we first want to separate fixed fees into two categories:</p><li> <strong>  Fixed fee for traditional portfolio management services </strong></li><p> Charging a recurring fixed fee for providing advisory services is a model with which many regulators are quite familiar and often comfortable. In particular, this is not an uncommon fee model for RIA firms serving the ultra high net worth client segment. An example of this model would be charging an annual client advisory fee of $5,000 regardless of the client's level of assets under management. Often, this fixed fee is split into quarterly payments which would equate to $1,250 each in this example.</p><p> In general, charging a fixed fee for providing ongoing portfolio management services will not lead to compliance issues, so long as (i) no more than 6 months of fees are collected in advance in order to avoid  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/does-your-ria-firm-firm-have-custody\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   potential custody issues  </a> </u>  and (ii) the fixed fee is not considered to be \"excessive\" given the client's portfolio. Many states consider annual advisory fees to be excessive if they are greater than 2-3% of the client's AUM. Thus, charging an annual $5,000 fixed fee for portfolio management services to a client with only $100,000 in managed assets would generally not be allowed.</p><li> <strong>  Fixed fee for other services such as financial planning </strong></li><p> On the other hand, a new variation of the fixed fee model entails RIA firms charging a monthly fee to clients that often do not have significant investment assets. In contrast to firms offering fixed portfolio management fees to ultra high net worth clients, this arrangement is often utilized by firms looking to serve a younger or less affluent set of clients than those traditionally served by most advisory firms today. Developing a new business model to serve these less traditional clients is an exciting development for the industry, but there may be some firms contemplating this new fee model that do not fully understand the relevant regulatory considerations.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.securities.utah.gov/docs/papers_Retainer_Fees.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Utah Division of Securities issued regulatory guidance back in February 2009 on retainer fees  </a> </u>  that does a very nice job of highlighting some of the potential issues with this new variant of fixed fees. In particular, the release from the Utah Division of Securities notes the following:</p><p> The Division finds a common mistake is for an adviser to use the terms &ldquo;Fixed Fees&rdquo; and &ldquo;Retainer Fees&rdquo; interchangeably.</p><p> To clarify, a Fixed Fee is a fee based on the set dollar amount for a given service or set of services. The set dollar amount is either predetermined by the adviser or negotiated between the adviser and the client. Moreover, Fixed Fees can be charged in advance or in arrears. From the Division&rsquo;s review of investment advisers who purport to charge Retainer Fees, most are actually charging a Fixed Fee in advance and mislabeling that fee a &ldquo;Retainer Fee.&rdquo; </p><p> A Retainer Fee is generally an agreement between a professional (in this case, investment adviser) and a client in which the client agrees to pay a sum of money to the professional for the professional&rsquo;s performance of or promise to be available to perform, at an agreed price, any services that are needed during a specified period. </p><p> Retainer Fees can take different forms, but the Division considers most Retainer Fees unreasonable advisory fees. However, one form of Retainer Fee may be charged to Utah clients if established correctly.</p><p> While the above release is specifically relevant to RIA firms registered in the state of Utah, it's important to note that many state and federal regulators share similar concerns in regard to firms charging a fixed monthly, quarterly, or annual fee with no specific ongoing services delivered to the client. In other words, an adviser that charges a flat monthly fee in exchange for simply being available to answer a client's questions without any additional regular service or deliverable being provided to the client could be deemed an \" <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-unethical-practices\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unethical business practice  </a> </u> \" by regulators.</p><p> It's important to note that this is still an emerging compliance topic and therefore each regulatory jurisdiction may take slightly different stances on what constitutes \"services being provided,\" but in general charging a fee to a client to just be available to answer questions is likely to create regulatory issues. </p><h3> Potential RIA Regulatory Issues Related to Auto Billing a Client's Credit Card <br/>  </h3><p> It should also be highlighted that advisory firms auto-charging clients on a regular basis via credit card or other similar methods need to exercise great caution. As more advisory firms look to serve younger or less wealthy clients that are not utilizing the services of traditional RIA custodians which allow for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/does-my-ria-firm-have-custody-due-to-direct-fee-deduction-of-investment-advisory-fees\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   direct advisory fee debiting  </a> </u> , these advisers are exploring alternative fee collection methods. While many firms still send traditional invoices to a client and wait for payment via check to arrive, some firms are looking to auto-bill clients like other traditional consumer service companies. </p><p> The challenge is that some jurisdictions may consider an advisory firm having access to (and the ability to directly charge) a client's credit card to be a custody violation. Thus, it's important that firms looking to bill via credit card or other similar methods further explore the best billing process in order to avoid potential compliance issues. Whether billing clients via a traditional custodian relationship or via some other method, it's important to remember that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/proper-client-fee-billing-is-an-ria-compliance-regulatory-focus-area\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   proper client fee billing is a top investment adviser regulatory focus area  </a> </u> .</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 20:22:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 20:22:59.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_T2puL24.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ria-compliance-issues-when-charging-fixed-flat-or-retainer-fees/\", \"post_id\": \"8284\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 20:22:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 20:22:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ria-compliance-issues-when-charging-fixed-flat-or-retainer-fees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8283\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3895\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RIA-Compliance-Issues-When-Charging-Fixed-Flat-or-Retainer-Fees.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"967\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451468700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The report noted that banks are  &ldquo;increasingly aware that technology investment is critical to developing new sources of competitive advantage&rdquo;  and  &ldquo;banks are investing in capabilities such analytics and channels that will help deliver a more intimate customer experience&rdquo;.</p><p> Faced with a snowstorm of options and opportunities, and a fintech landscape made more complex by the day, for wealth managers looking for a route map they could do worse than putting a greater focus on prioritising investment digitising processes against what clients will most value.  Wealth managers, for whom client ownership and ownership of the client experience can be quite fraught issues, often find this sort of client centric decision making quite problematic.</p><p> Three key ways to support the development of  a more client-centric viewpoint are:</p><li> Client journey mapping can help firms better understand the client experience and provide an insight into the key areas of focus that will drive client satisfaction upwards.</li><li> Bringing the voice of the client in to your firm (see \" <u>  <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/media/1064/1509-client-research-acanthus-consulting.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What client and introducer insight can do for your firm  </a> </u> \") may uncover ways to make relatively simple, straight-forward enhancements to the client experience that have value for clients both overall and at key touch points.</li><li> Firms shouldn't be afraid to involve clients directly in prototyping and testing discussions - a great way to engage with the next generation of clients perhaps? <br/>  </li><p> Responding to clients&rsquo; greater demand requires greater internal connectivity in organisations where marketing &ndash; traditionally the champions of the voice of the consumer &ndash; have often been silo&rsquo;d out of IT and operations decision-making.  Bringing marketing and the voice of the client into the room will be key.</p><p> <strong>  \"Firms need to view digital as being essential to delivering a seamless and integrated client experience, and prioritise their investments based on how clients want to engage with their wealth managers and the firm.&rdquo; - 2014 World Wealth Report. </strong></p> <p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 20:27:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 20:27:29.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_grQjOBE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/clients-take-centre-stage-in-the-digital-debate/\", \"post_id\": \"8286\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 20:27:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 20:27:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"clients-take-centre-stage-in-the-digital-debate\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8285\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3896\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Clients-Take-Centre-Stage-in-the-Digital-Age.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"360\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451471400,"author_id":167,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3763,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 2016 Marketing & Sales Strategy For Financial Advisers","link":"the-2016-marketing-sales-strategy-for-financial-advisers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  Econnexx </u></p><p> Create a marketing and sales strategy for 2016 that is efficiently focused on generating more clients and funds under management. We explain why commonly used strategies often yield little reward and merely consume valuable time and resource as well as detail the most effective methods available to increase exposure and attract more clients.</p><h3> Set Yourself a Target For 2016 <br/>  </h3><p> Having a clear focus on your business' objectives and establishing a plan to reach those objectives is imperative to future success, get this right and your firm will thrive in 2016!</p><p> Firstly, set yourself a realistic target for what you want to achieve in 2016, for example, and additional &pound;5 million of funds under management.</p><p> Secondly, establish an affordable and realistic budget of what you are prepared to spend in order to achieve such goals.</p><p> Finally, create and implement an effective strategy that will enable you to cost effectively hit your 2016 target.</p><h3> Build An Effective Online Presence <br/>  </h3><p> More and more consumers utilise the internet to search for financial information, in-fact over 89% currently do so. Having a website is the obvious solution for many firms to get in front of online consumers, with large numbers investing significant resources into developing their online website. However, many financial firms have failed to see any real return on their website investment. The 2 main reasons for this are:</p><p> 1. They have no definitive plan for their website. On average less than 1% of visitors to financial services websites request an appointment or make direct contact.</p><p> 2. The significant majority of financial websites lack clarity for consumers and offer little or no immediate value. <br/>  </p><p> Both of these points are significant and a major reason why many firms have seen little return from their website investment. To convert a website into an online hub for client generation it must incorporated into a wider strategy that utilises channels such as social media and email marketing. Combined, these channels create an online presence that generates leads and clients.</p><h3> Attracting Clients To Your Firm <br/>  </h3><p> The digital age has created many new avenues that firms can utilise to generate interest and attract consumers. Channels such as Linkedin, Twitter &amp; Email marketing provide financial advisers with the ability to find and communicate with unlimited numbers of potential new clients. </p><p> The following 3 step strategy will help you utilise online technology to build your firm and your client numbers.</p><p> <strong>  1. Define Your Target Audience </strong></p><p> Not everyone is an ideal fit for your firm, but channels such as Linkedin can help you find and target those who fit your ideal client type. Linkedin's advanced search feature enables you to search for people based on location and title. For example, if you are based in Norwich, you can filter your search to only return results that are 50 miles from postcode NR1. Once you have defined the area you wish to focus on you can then set filters to only target certain individuals. For example, if your ideal client type is a high ranking corporate business man, then search terms such as CEO, Director or executive will help you find those who fit your ideal profile.</p><p> Once you have found your ideal profile, use the following 3 steps to create and optimise your social strategy.</p><li> Ensure your Linkedin profile is professional and consumer focused. All to often financial advisers use their linked in profiles to connect with fellow financial professionals. Your Linkedin profile is an extension of your firm and should be used to appeal to and communicate with potential consumers.</li><li> Linkedin is a networking platform, use it to proactively grow your Linkedin profile by connecting with your target audience. Allocate a proportion of your free time to doing this task.</li><li> Build relationships with your connections by sharing useful information relevant to your firms area of expertise, share links to your website or content pieces within your website - and don't be afraid to ask for an informal chat or meeting. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Build a consumer-focused website </strong></p><p> A consumer focused website that is content rich and designed to appeal to your target audience is a must for online success. In order to maximise your websites potential you must utilise tools such as online forms and landing pages to convert your website visitors into contacts (who will potentially become your paying clients).</p><p> 4 ways to maximise your websites potential</p><li> The content within your website must be focused on those you wish to attract. Your website should be a place where consumers can easily obtain the information they seek. The more relevant your content is to your visitors the more appointments you will generate.</li><li> Use relevant and enticing content offerings to provide instant value.</li><li> Use forms and landing pages to collect visitor information in return for the piece of content they choose to download. If it's of value, consumers will complete the form to receive access to your content, this could be in the form of an ebook, an infographic or an online video.</li><li> Use the information collected from your forms to remain in contact with your visitors. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3. Email Marketing To Convert Contacts Into Clients </strong></p><p> The third step in the process is to use email marketing to convert a proportion of your contacts into clients. Email is statistically the highest converting form of client generation for financial advisers. By sending each contact a series of personalised emails relevant to the information they have provided, you greatly increase your chances of converting more contacts into clients. If a contact downloaded a '10 step retirement guide' from your website but had yet to make direct contact, you can send them a series of emails that are focused on retirement and how your firm can help them achieve their retirement goals, with a request for an introductory telephone call.</p><p> This 3 step process is the most effective for firms to generate their own clients. However, it can be time-consuming and labour intensive which might not be suitable for all financial firms, but there is a solution available that is both cost effective and extremely successful.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 20:36:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 20:36:21.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_5YG9vSH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-2016-marketing-sales-strategy-for-financial-advisers/\", \"post_id\": \"8288\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 20:36:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 20:36:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-2016-marketing-sales-strategy-for-financial-advisers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8287\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3897\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-2016-Marketing-Sales-Strategy-For-Financial-Advisers-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"576\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451732400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3764,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Lessons Learned in 2015","link":"lessons-learned-in-2015","source_link":null,"content":"<p> OK, as 2015 draws to a close, I&rsquo;m looking back at lessons learned.  I thought I should share Bert's Lessons learned in 2015.  Some are new, some are tried and true; some are so obvious or simple, they still get overlooked. The following are based on a number of proven tests and concepts from my own experiences, in my own business, and with my clients. So, they have to be true.</p><p> They are a set of recommendations (or exercises) that can be easily customized for each business. They&rsquo;re meant to help owners develop specific programs to improve profits, reduce costs and increase sales.  <strong>  Review them, and make a pledge to try at least one of them in 2016. </strong></p><li> The most important lesson, and one that has stood the test of time, is this:  DEVELOP, TEST, MEASURE and ADAPT. Test a new idea.  Ask customers, resources and staff how to do things better.  Measure the outcome of each initiative, and note why it failed and why it succeeded. Then, adapt as needed.  Get new ideas by attending seminars, webinars; see what books are trending, and visit your competitor.  Get inspired at how to work your business by spending an afternoon at an Apple store.</li><li> Understand the real needs of your customers, and develop goals to meet those needs. For example, many technical companies frequently benefit by worrying more about customer benefits rather than technical specifications. ( <strong>  For a new dynamic look at planning </strong> ,  <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.startupconnection.net/business-templates/business-plan-template/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    download our planning template   </a>  </u>  .) </strong></li><li> If you haven&rsquo;t looked at your business plan since you first wrote it eons ago, find it, and dust it off. Economies change and so do markets and competition &mdash; so your business needs to keep an eye out and change accordingly. <strong>  In particular, focus on the 80-20 rule, i.e., 80% percent of your business comes from 20% of your clients; pay more to attention to higher margin items than commodities. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Our website offers a free business model template.  It will not only knock your socks off, but will quickly and accurately help you, (yes, YOU!) develop a financial forecast of profits based on a few simple questions.  </strong> (That&rsquo;s why your sock will fall off.)   It&rsquo;s also dynamic (meaning, able to change), and allows you to better understand the relationships between alternative sales, pricing and marketing models.</li><li> Stay competitive and aware of what your competition is doing.  Keep a dialog open with your supplier and discuss the trends they&rsquo;re seeing. Their ideas can be gold.   <strong>  Everyone is trying to stay competitive and many customers and suppliers will react to programs like dynamic pricing. </strong> I have been helping clients execute programs for years and the practice was recently written up in the Wall Street Journal. It can be as simple as &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo; in bars (where prices are low for a certain amount of time) or sophisticated models like the airlines use (paying for everything including toilet paper. Just kidding on the toilet paper, but you get what I mean).</li><li> Stay ahead of the big internet sales sites, and social media. Most common are Pinterest, Groupon, Kings Road, EBay, Amazon, Google, and Apple.  How is your competition handling sales on their internet site? Do you know what the big trend is? You better.  Or you may miss out on a great and profitable opportunity.  Suppose you sell fancy sunglasses, and a big star was photographed with those same sunglasses on Instagram?  Hmmmm?</li><li> Join a networking group, put up a Twitter page, update your website or raffle off a free lunch to anyone who puts his or her business card in your fishbowl.  Attend small interactive workshops and events to meet, discuss and test ideas with other small business owners.</li><li> Running a small business is a challenge, but it&rsquo;s also exciting, rewarding and fun.  By keeping an eye and an ear to your marketplace, and the lives of your customers, you are already ahead of many of your competitors.</li><li> Plain and simple: meet customer needs, develop exciting efforts to differentiate yourself from competition and constantly measure and adapt.  Oh, I already said that.</li><li> <strong>  Congratulate yourself on all the great things you did this year including even just saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to customers, employees and suppliers. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Happy New Year!</h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 20:41:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 20:41:24.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_LmZJTHK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/lessons-learned-in-2015/\", \"post_id\": \"8290\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 20:41:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 20:41:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"lessons-learned-in-2015\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8289\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3898\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Lessons-Learned-in-2015-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"464\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451506500,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3765,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Helping Women With Their IPOs","link":"helping-women-with-their-ipos","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Though women have been in the workforce for a long time, they&rsquo;re still operating at a disadvantage when compared to men. It&rsquo;s a competitive world out there. It&rsquo;s time to recognize the value that women hold for your organization. Inclusive leaders know that becoming more inclusive of their female workforce is a business imperative. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;nice to do.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a must do to succeed in today&rsquo;s competitive global business environment. In order to become more inclusive of women and work toward workplace equality, inclusive leaders need to make sure they&rsquo;re equipping their female employees with the tools they need to succeed.</p><p> Providing women with the tools they need to succeed applies to those mentoring women outside of the workplace, as well. Andie Burjek explains how mentors can help their female mentees in her article,  <u>  &ldquo;Why Women Need IPO: Information, Power and Opportunity.&rdquo; </u>  As the title suggests, Burjek says that the keys to a woman&rsquo;s success in the professional world are  <strong>  information, power and opportunity.   </strong></p><p> Burjek &mdash; who credits Grace Killelea with the coining the initialism IPO &mdash; says that  <strong>  information </strong>  refers to receiving intel that will help advance a woman&rsquo;s career. This means finding out whether a company is hiring for a position she&rsquo;s interested in, or telling her about a networking event that&rsquo;s happening next week. Some women are great at seeking the information on their own, but it never hurts to have an extra set of eyes and ears looking out and listening for information that will benefit your career.</p><p> <strong>  Power  </strong> refers to a woman&rsquo;s relationships and her own attitude. While it&rsquo;s important to have the skills necessary to perform a job, being able to network might be even more crucial. Meeting others is a great way to get a foot in the door at a company you respects, or to get a position that you&rsquo;ve always wanted. When women are meeting other professionals, attitude is an equally important part in the power equation. Inclusive leaders and mentors need to reiterate to their female employees and mentees that having a positive attitude and carrying themselves with confidence will help them make those important and powerful connections while networking.</p><p> Lastly, armed with the information and power they have, women need to act on opportunities when they arise. Many times, women are afraid to ask for what they want in the workplace because they don&rsquo;t want to be seen as too aggressive. This could mean that they might miss out on applying for a promotion, asking for a raise or offering up suggestions in a meeting. Inclusive leaders need to encourage women to ask for what they want, rather than holding back. Women need to know that they&rsquo;re a vital part of the organization and that they have a right to contribute ideas to the company, as well as to reach for career advancement opportunities.</p><p> Are you helping your female employees and mentees gain information, power and opportunity?

Skip! I&rsquo;m pretty sure it is impossible for you &ndash; or those around you &mdash; to stay angry or stressed after a skip around the block (plus it&rsquo;s great exercise).</p><p> <strong>  4. Make friends </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Will you be my friend?&rdquo; While we might not ask exactly the same question in our grown-up lives, the sentiment is the same: we need to reach out and make connections &ndash; in business and in the rest of our lives.  <strong>  Friendships always matter because it really is all about relationships! </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Remember no man is a failure who has friends,&rdquo; writes Clarence the angel in the last scene of possibly the most inspirational, and greatest Christmas film of all-time&hellip; It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life.</p><p> <strong>  5.

Smile </strong></p><p> A smile is a powerful little movement:  it relieves stress, reduces blood pressure, can change your mood (see #2 above &mdash; start with the smile), and my personal favorite, it is one of the few contagious things we actually WANT.  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/whats-the-roi-of-a-smile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Give away a smile and it comes right back to you!  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  7.

Be fearless </strong></p><p> When did our lives shift from fearlessness to playing it safe and basing our decisions so heavily around mitigating risk?  If we let fear get in the way, we trade innovation for stagnation&hellip; genius for mediocrity &hellip; adventure for boredom. <strong>  Which sounds better to you? </strong></p><p> <strong>  9.  Sing </strong></p><p> Singing is a wonderful form of expression, even if it is just you singing along to a song in the car when nobody else can hear you. Don&rsquo;t you love when you pass someone in traffic who is &ldquo;dancing&rdquo; and singing, in their own world with the music? Be one of those people!</p><p> <strong>  10. Wonder about everything </strong></p><p> Wonder is one of the most important tools we have in our lives, no matter what age we are. When we wonder about everything, we remain curious and interested in everything and everyone around us, always looking for possibilities.  World-changing innovations grow from wonder.</p><p> <strong>  11. Explore </strong></p><p> Exploration is a fantastic way to get new perspectives, both literally and figuratively.

Does he frustrate you? Or are you happy for an opposing view to drive alternative thinking or to facilitate deeper conversation? <br/> <br/> Either way, there's a rule that outlines what that person is doing or should be doing; <strong>  it's the 10th man rule. </strong> <br/> <br/> The 10th man rule comes from Israel, where all (government/military) decisions are put before a panel of 10 people. When nine of the ten people completely agree that a particular decision is the way to go, it's the job of the 10th man to question the decision, to disagree, to take an opposing view so as to avoid the pitfalls of groupthink. <br/> <br/> Honestly, I can't disagree with this approach. It reminds me of this General George S. Patton quote:</p> If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking. <br/> <p> And that reminds me of my approach to hiring. When I hire people, I look forward to having each person bring something of value, something different - different experiences, different perspectives. I want each person on my team to challenge the current approach, the current way of thinking, the traditional way of doing things. <br/> <br/> I've also left a couple employers early in my CX career because the approach was: \"We've always done things this way. We've done things this way for 40 years. We're going to continue doing them that way.\" Ugh. So frustrating. Let the record show: I hate that thinking! <br/> <br/> And it also reminds me of situations where there have been employees who have stayed with companies for 15 or 20 or more years, who get comfortable with the way things are. Tenure is not a bad thing. But complacency is. Thinking we know everything there is to know is a bad thing, too. <br/> <br/> How do we fix that? I can think of a couple ways:</p><li> encourage continuous learning, always being up to date on the latest industry happenings, technology, methodologies, approaches, etc.</li><li> hire new people, bring in different backgrounds and fresh perspectives</li><li> do your homework and research the pros, cons, alternatives, etc.</li><li> conduct a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/03/cem-toolbox-setting-stage-for-voc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pre-mortem  </a> </u>  in your decision-making process</li><li> employ this 10th man rule</li><p> <br/> You don't actually have to have 10 people in a room making a decision.

{"original_id":3768,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Effective Communication and How to Get What You Want From People","link":"effective-communication-and-how-to-get-what-you-want-from-people","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you want something, sometimes the best approach is to ask for it. We ask customers to buy our products; we ask potential investors to put their trust &ndash; and money &ndash; into our ideas; we ask for salary increases and promotions; we raise complaints, etc. Some people just ask naturally but in many cases &ndash; especially in business &ndash; people hold back because they don&rsquo;t want to appear pushy or aggressive.</p><p> Asking for something means first identifying what it is you want. For example, if you are an aspiring entrepreneur, saying that you have a great idea for a new company and you want to start your own business is not good enough. Your dream may be clear to you, but your goal may not be objective and understandable enough for others. This is why many times you might get something, but not what you were hoping for. Before asking for what you want, first establish what you need; in other words, you must  <u>  <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/on-the-importance-of-prioritizing-and-defining-a-desired-outcome/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   clearly define your desired outcome  </a> </u> .</p><p> You may be laser-focused on your end goals and still find it difficult to effectively communicate to others your ideas, needs and concerns. Why? For one thing, some people are naturally more hesitant and agreeable and less inclined to &ldquo;go for it&rdquo; in certain situations &ndash; we refer to them as the &ldquo;Low Ds&rdquo;, based on the  <u>  DISC measures of observable behavior </u> . Secondly, a lack of experience can be a  <u>  <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/identifying-and-removing-obstacles/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   major obstacle  </a> </u>  in communicating your needs to other people, especially if those people are your superiors. If you haven&rsquo;t had much practice in this area, asking clearly, concisely and explicitly for what you want can be quite challenging and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/understand-other-people/201504/is-your-workplace-stressing-you-out\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stressful  </a> </u> .</p><p> Developing interpersonal communication skills is key to getting people to understand what you may want from them and how they can accommodate your needs. The following Six Keys to Confident Communication may help you articulate the right message, for the right audience, at the right time, and in doing so, help you get what you want!</p><li> <strong>  Have a clearly defined reason. </strong>  And put it in writing before delivering your message to the listener(s). You must answer the question &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ndash; Why do you need what you are about to ask for? Why is it necessary for your desired outcome? Why do you need it now? Having your reasons in writing makes a difference: Not only will you be able to find words easily &ndash; instead of blurting out the first thing that comes to mind &ndash; when actually speaking to the listener(s), but you will also set expectations for your audience on what you hope to accomplish in the exchange.</li><li> <strong>  Know your audience and to whom you are speaking. </strong>  In order to connect with the recipient(s) of your message, you must first get to know the person or people to whom you are going to speak. Too often, people make the mistake of approaching someone with a script in their mind but without a clear understanding of what is relevant to the other party. By learning a little about your listener(s), you will be able to tailor your message and its delivery such that it can be easily understood. Effective communication is not about getting your message out; it is about making sure that the other party hears and comprehends what you are saying.</li><li> <strong>  Segment the information. </strong>  This step is especially important when you must explain a new concept or complex idea, or simply when there is a lot of information to be delivered. The last thing you want is to confuse your listener(s), since confusion can easily turn into annoyance and loss of interest. Create a flow of information by dividing it into smaller and easier-to-process chunks. Again, simplicity is key: You want your audience to be able to follow you from A to B without any difficulties.</li><li> <strong>  Provide context. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t just assume that the other party will understand what you are talking about and why they should want to help you. You want to anticipate the questions your listener(s) may have and answer them before they are even asked. &ldquo;Why are you asking me for help?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; and other questions like these are good examples of what you should be prepared for. Another good idea would be to use analogies for explaining multiple or abstract concepts. Whenever appropriate, don&rsquo;t hesitate to use humor to break down the barriers between you and your listener(s); when people are in good spirits they are more likely to consider helping you out.</li><li> <strong>  Match their style. </strong>  It&rsquo;s easy to become preoccupied with  <u>  <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/say-sometimes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what you want to say  </a> </u>  and how you are going to do it, and forget about the person (or people) right in front of you. Who are you talking to? What drives them? What type of  <u>  behavioral style </u>  do they have? Some people prefer their information concise and to the point, while others need to be walked through all the steps and their respective alternatives. Consider both verbal and non-verbal messages, and tailor your communication appropriately.</li><li> <strong>  Bring closure. </strong>  Closure is essential to ensure that the other party got your message right. Restate your point and the pertinent key elements, make sure to clear up any ambiguity that could have occurred, and suggest the next steps for the other party to take in order to accommodate your request. <br/>  </li><p> Effective communication plays an important part in our lives, and it is actually easier to achieve than most people think. These strategies will help you communicate your ideas, requests and concerns in a clearer and more cogent manner, bringing you closer to your desired outcome.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 21:12:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 21:12:47.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_xcIQcgs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/effective-communication-and-how-to-get-what-you-want-from-people/\", \"post_id\": \"8299\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 21:12:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 21:12:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"effective-communication-and-how-to-get-what-you-want-from-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8298\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3903\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Effective-Communication-and-How-to-Get-What-You-Want.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"317\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451472300,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

For instance, we previewed this year&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://summit.marketcounsel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MarketCounsel Summit  </a> </u>  in a blog post highlighting exciting trends and opinions around the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/bringing-the-ria-regulatory-and-political-heat-to-south-beach/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   regulatory and political space for RIAs  </a> </u> . Our attending team leaders also consistently live-tweeted nearly every major presentation and used the #MSUM15 hashtag to draw attention. They helped make sense of the conference&rsquo;s themes and flagged pertinent information for others. Take the wheel and drive home your message and key takeaways.</li><li>   <strong>  Showcase the breadth of your expertise </strong> &ndash; Your firm is jam packed with intelligent and able people. Why not give them the chance to have their voice heard? Take our long-standing client CBIZ for example. Check out  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.cbiz.com/insights-resources/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the firm&rsquo;s blog  </a> </u>  and you&rsquo;ll see a list of experts extending far and wide to reach all corners of its business. Posts outlining tax planning best practices sit alongside a review of the Affordable Care Act and tips for avoiding a cybersecurity attack. Users visiting the page are immediately met with a ride range of content showcasing CBIZ&rsquo;s thought leadership on multiple topics. Diversity of opinion is the best way to display your firm&rsquo;s depth of expertise.</li><li> <strong>  Listen, learn &amp; lecture </strong> &ndash; What&rsquo;s everyone talking about? Listen up. Take what you&rsquo;re hearing in meetings and calls and use it to drive your content creation. Embrace social media; it is a great place to take the temperature of the industry. Take this  <u>  Storify </u>  of reporters&rsquo; reactions to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s rate hike last week. Know what&rsquo;s being said about topics of importance to your business and throw your hat in the ring. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to offer a fresh take or propose a new question to start a conversation.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thenewshackers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NewsHack  </a> </u>  your way into top outlets by sprinting ahead of the news cycle. Tell the world the story of how you&rsquo;re moving the ground on which your industry stands and steer the media to you.</li>Don&rsquo;t let content marketing be the resolution that slips through the cracks this year. Actions matter more than words on a page, and the most important aspect of developing your strategy is following through with it. Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, and over time content marketing will become a prized vehicle for your firm&rsquo;s storytelling.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 21:19:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 21:19:17.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_eO7bm2K.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/energize-your-content-marketing-strategy-for-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8303\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 21:19:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 21:19:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"energize-your-content-marketing-strategy-for-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8302\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3905\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Energize-Your-Content-Marketing-Strategy-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"371\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451505600,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3771,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Reasons Our Pursuit Of Happiness Is All Wrong","link":"7-reasons-our-pursuit-of-happiness-is-all-wrong","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Are you really happy? If not, do you know what it would take to make you happy?</p><p> My observation is that most of us attribute happiness with safety and security. Don&rsquo;t you remember when you were in high school? Didn&rsquo;t it feel good when you were accepted by the &ldquo;in&rdquo; crowd? I recall when I made the track team, I felt really happy. The truth was that I was happy not as much for the accomplishment as I was about strutting around school wearing my track jacket and walking around with members of the team. It felt good. I was far from the most socially or academically successful kid in my school. So when I made the team, a newfound confidence came over me and I felt happy. And you might be thinking, &ldquo;Just leave it be, why analyze it. Happiness is happiness, let it be.&rdquo;</p><p> But I can&rsquo;t. Why? Because I have come to know that our pursuit of happiness is more about the search for safety and security.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s see how we are often fooled by our pursuit of happiness.</p><h3> 1. Being accepted</h3><p> Certainly when we are accepted into a group, we have the security offered by the crowd. This security will likely cause us to be happy. Yet, looking at it more closely, we give up much of our autonomy and individuality. Moreover, being accepted into an organization or institution with an elite reputation can feel really good. But if doing so is to establish or maintain bragging rights of superiority, happiness will remain elusive for you.</p><h3> 2. Money</h3><p> Money provides security because it purchases food, clothing, and shelter&mdash;vital ingredients for our safety. But money and the pursuit of it affords something else: the ability to be one-up from the next guy. This appears to provide security, safety, and decreased vulnerability. However, those over whom you are one up will not feel so secure with your wealth and likely look to take it away somehow.</p><h3> 3. Attention</h3><p> Getting attention, consciously or subconsciously, for attributes commonly associated with success can lead to a sense of confidence, thus security, and hence, happiness. Physical characteristics of beauty or strength are obvious ones.  Other attention grabbing security blanket also includes certain jobs that lead to fame and fortune. So when we strive for these things, we think happiness will follow. Yet it often doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s because the attention we seek, often below our level of awareness, is for others to notice we are above them. And no matter how hard we try there will always be a whole host of other competitors.</p><h3> 4. Being the Envy of Others</h3><p> Similar to the item above, being the envy of others can bring a certain, albeit very sordid, sense of contentment. You may resist thinking that you could possess such emotions, but think about what you would do if you lived (in a very modest house) close to the neighborhood where the CEO of Coca Cola lived. And although you acknowledge that Coca Cola products are among the unhealthiest products, the wealth of the CEO would be hard for you and others not to envy. And, I would guess that most would readily offer up in conversation the fact that they live within such close proximity to a person of such high stature. However, as I wrote above, when the quest is to be the envy of others, therefore sitting on top of the heap, you risk becoming a target (the Germans call it schadenfreude). Internal unhappiness can also come from indulging one&rsquo;s own entitlement, as the CEO might due. </p><h3> 5. Being In A Relationship</h3><p> Before you find your soul mate, you must first discover your soul. Too many believe they will be happy when in a relationship with someone else. This is more to relieve loneliness and to protect us than any other reason. True happiness will come when two independent people come together with the only needs they have are the needs to grow and share their lives. When one needs the other for happiness, it becomes what is known as a co-dependent relationship.</p><h3> 6. The Suffering of Others</h3><p> Certainly this one would be very difficult to admit; just think of the guilt you would feel. But haven&rsquo;t you heard or uttered yourself these very words, &ldquo;It could be worse.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have it have as bad as....&rdquo; When we say these words, we are basically saying that the fact that others are worse off than us gives us some degree of security. And isn&rsquo;t that what I&rsquo;m talking about here? The place from where most of our happiness arises is a place of security. Knowing that we could be worse off, (like others), gives us some comfort. Now, I realize, some who are reading this are saying to me, &ldquo;Speak for yourself, buddy. I&rsquo;m not that selfish or cruel.&rdquo; But, you see, such emotions come from our primitive nature&mdash;our Automatic Brain (AB)&mdash;which fires automatically, instantaneously and often generates thoughts, behaviors, and yes, emotions that may be difficult for us, but in a crude, animalistic way afford us security.</p><h3> 7. Less Is More</h3><p> You have heard it, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor.&rdquo; Those who accept a simple life may indeed have found happiness. Yet, if one accepts this life because they fear anything else, then they are committing to the same AB dynamics as the CEO above. This comfort zone may not permit the growth for which your true nature yearns and from which your true happiness arises.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 21:23:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 21:23:04.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_WFgd4zv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-reasons-our-pursuit-of-happiness-is-all-wrong/\", \"post_id\": \"8305\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 21:23:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 21:23:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-reasons-our-pursuit-of-happiness-is-all-wrong\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8304\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3906\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-Reasons-Our-Pursuit-of-Happiness-Is-All-Wrong-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"979\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451482200,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

The truth is that we should always be vigilant about our money matters. Will you use the countdown to 2016 to review your financial matters?</p><h3> Review your Financial Matters: Are your Savings on Track for the New Year? <br/>  </h3><p> The end of the year is a good time to take stock of our current financial situation and make a plan to budget for our 2016 contributions to our savings plans: Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA), Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), and Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP).</p><p> <strong>  Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) </strong></p><p> The maximum RRSP limit for 2015 is $24,930.00.00. In addition to your allowable annual contribution amount you can carry forward any unused contribution from 1994-2014. Depending on your tax bracket, maximizing your total RRSP room can potentially create a sizeable tax rebate. Your blue Notice of Assessment mailed to you from Revenue Canada annually will indicate what you are able to contribute. If you can&rsquo;t locate it, you can access it by signing into My Account at the CCRA website.</p><p> <strong>  Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA) </strong></p><p> The current annual limit for TFSAs is $10,000 per year. As of January 1, 2016, it will drop to $5,500.00 per year, but the government will leave the limit for 2015 untouched. As of next year, the Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau has announced that the annual contribution limit will be indexed to inflation.</p><p> Contributions held in this account are not tax deductible, but they are also not taxed when they are withdrawn. Depending on your financial situation, this type of account can be used along with your RRSP or as your main retirement savings account. The TFSA is a flexible option that can hold cash, stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. A financial advisor can help you determine the right mix of investments for your needs.</p><p> <strong>  Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) </strong></p><p> A parent or grandparent can start an RESP for a dependent child as a way to save money for post-secondary education expenses. To start a plan, you will need to apply for a Social Insurance Number (SIN) for the child. The money invested in the plan is not tax-deductible, but it grows on a tax-free basis until it is withdrawn.</p><p> The federal government encourages families to save for a child&rsquo;s post-secondary education in this manner by providing the Canada Education Savings Grant. The basic amount is 20% of annual contributions to an annual maximum of $500.00. The lifetime limit for each recipient is $7,200.00.</p><p> Before you celebrate the start of the New Year with family and friends, why don&rsquo;t you give yourself the gift of a financial plan? </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-29 21:25:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-29 21:25:44.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_1NRVWtf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/countdown-to-2016-time-to-review-your-financial-matters/\", \"post_id\": \"8307\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-29 21:25:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-29 21:25:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"countdown-to-2016-time-to-review-your-financial-matters\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8306\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3907\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Countdown-to-2016.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"685\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451509200,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3773,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why SMALL Changes in Your First Impression Ignite a BIG Impact on Your Financial Planning Prospects","link":"why-small-changes-in-your-first-impression-ignite-a-big-impact-on-your-financial-planning-prospects","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s okay. You can admit it.</p><p> When you ask yourself how many prospects you  really  have for your financial planning business, you mostly tell yourself an exaggerated story.</p><p> Why? Because the real answer might be embarrassing.</p><p> You keep meaning to work on getting more people interested in your financial planning service &ndash; and you&rsquo;ve read plenty of tips on how to do it &ndash; but in truth, your prospect-list has barely changed.</p><p> Unfortunately, when different experts give you contrasting tips, you can struggle to know which tip to follow.</p><p> Fortunately, surefire, simple and scientifically proven shortcuts exist. And no one has probably told you about them.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s talk about scientific proof first.</p><p> Scientists who studied the persuasion process have consistently revealed a simple, yet remarkable truth when it comes to effectively influencing others to do business with you. Here&rsquo;s the secret right off the bat:</p><p> Often it&rsquo;s the SMALLEST change that makes the BIGGEST difference for your success</p><p> <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.485.14&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   A study by behavioral scientists  </u>    </a> shows that the difference-quantity depends on how much progress you make in the early stages.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll explain by giving you an example.</p><p> In one study customers in a sushi restaurant were given a loyalty card and told that they would receive a free lunch for every 10 purchases they made.</p><p> There were two types of customers. One group that made little progress by buying one or two lunches. And another group who made lots of progress by buying six or seven lunches at once.</p><p> It turns out that customers who made a small amount of initial progress by buying lunch just for themselves, were twice as likely to return to the restaurant if they focused on the progress they made toward the free lunch.</p><p> However, those customers who made a lot of initial progress &ndash; perhaps because they bought lunch for themselves and a group of friends &ndash; were more likely to return if their attention was focused on the progress that remained to get the free lunch.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because people tend to be more motivated to complete a goal when their focus is directed towards the SMALL area. Whether that SMALL area concerns the progress already made, or the effort that remains.</p><p> Let me repeat that, because it&rsquo;s important:</p><p> People tend to be more motivated when their focus is directed towards the SMALL area</p><p> To prove this statement I recommend this cool 5-minute animation video from persuasion-master Dr. Robert Cialdini, where he tells vividly about the SMALLEST change that makes the BIGGEST difference:</p><p> And if you really want to dig in deep, here&rsquo;s the link to the book:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781252750/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1781252750&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;linkId=4BKWOKHJXVBSGQA2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Small Big: Small Changes That Spark Big Influence  </a> </u> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1781252750\"/></p><p> So, I asked myself:</p><p> What&rsquo;s the SMALLEST change financial planners can make, that has the BIGGEST impact on their number of prospects?</p><p> I&rsquo;ll tell you about that in a minute. Because &ndash; although a bit painful &ndash; we have to acknowledge these 3 mistakes when it comes to attracting prospects.</p><p> <strong>  Mistake #1: </strong>   You&rsquo;re telling your prospects about reaching their goals</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a definition of a goal according to Wikipedia: &ldquo;A goal is a desired result that a person envisions, plans and commits to achieve. A personal desired end-point in some sort of assumed development.&rdquo;</p><p> Now, what do the words desired, envisions, plans, achieve, end-point, development all have in common?</p><p> Those words focus on the far, far future. They focus on the long-term, on the end.</p><p> And guess what you&rsquo;ve learned a couple of sentences ago:</p><p> People tend to be more motivated when their focus is directed towards the SMALLEST step1</p><p> That&rsquo;s why, if you want to motivate your prospects, you shouldn&rsquo;t focus on their goals at first. Because it&rsquo;s way too big of a leap for them in this early phase of your relationship.</p><p> <strong>  Mistake #2:  </strong> You&rsquo;re focussing your promise on a &ldquo;comprehensive service&rdquo;</p><p> What&rsquo;s the opposite of SMALL?</p><p> Big. Wide. Extensive. Comprehensive.</p><p> That&rsquo;s right.</p><p> And I hear you think: &ldquo;But financial planning is all about an integrated view of people&rsquo;s finances. Our service MUST be comprehensive!&rdquo;</p><p> And I agree. Of course your service is comprehensive. It&rsquo;s what we do. It&rsquo;s what makes us unique. It&rsquo;s how we can add the most value.</p><p> But try to stand in the shoes of people who don&rsquo;t know you yet.</p><p> Do you think they understand? Or care?</p><p> No way. They haven&rsquo;t got a clue about the value they get when they haven&rsquo;t experienced it yet. That&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t sell your prospects on your &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; service. It doesn&rsquo;t motivate them.</p><p> <strong>  Mistake #3: </strong>   You&rsquo;re giving too much information</p><p> Most planners believe that when prospects make decisions, they consider all the available information at their disposal and come to an informed decision about calling them for an appointment.</p><p> They believe that the best way to persuade them is to provide them with all the available information and a rational explanation for why they should check their financial planning service out.</p><p> Yet, 60 years of science proves that it&rsquo;s not information per se that leads people to make decisions. What does, is the context in which information is presented.</p><p> You see, we are living in one of the most information-overloaded, stimulation-saturated environments that have ever existed.</p><p> People just don&rsquo;t have the capacity to fully consider every piece of information in their time-scarce, attention-challenged, busy lives.</p><p> As a result, anyone can significantly increase their ability to influence and persuade others by not only attempting to inform people into change.

I had the chance to watch it (reluctantly at first, I admit it) with my beautiful granddaughter.</h3><p> <br/> The main plot, of course, is the courtroom trial of a New York department store Santa Claus who claims that he is the real Santa Claus. There is a wonderful secondary plot that is the story of a little girl who, with the help of that same Santa Clause, nudges her mother toward a new romance with great promise for the future&mdash;a Christmas present indeed.</p><p> But I want to focus on a tertiary plot that unfolds. This Santa teaches the store clerks to send clients to other stores when those stores may have the right product for them&mdash;products that these same store clerks realize that they don&rsquo;t have. At first, the store&rsquo;s marketing department is aghast, until it takes the store President to realize its brilliance and makes it store policy.</p><p> Here is a big city department store doing what many small shop-owners have known all along. Go to any small town near you to test it out. Where I grew up most towns had what was known as the High Street; the place to find the baker, the butcher, the florist, the hair dresser, the bank, and so on.</p><p> These shop-owners knew that they were part of the fabric of the community. Products were not &lsquo;SKU&rsquo;s&rsquo; and customers were not simply buyers. All were part of the vibrant and complex uniqueness that gave their village or town its identity. Everyone knew everyone&rsquo;s name, and everyone knew that word traveled fast! With every interaction, the right to do business was on the line, and so was the shop-owner&rsquo;s reputation.</p><p> Some interactions resulted in a transaction, some did not&mdash;indeed some should not, because the shop-owner knew that they did not have the product to satisfy their customer&rsquo;s needs on that particular day; and so instead of automatically trying to &lsquo;cross-sell&rsquo; to a substitute, they guided the customer to another store that likely had the right product. They knew that the customer would be back at the right time.</p><p> There&rsquo;s an underlying set of rules here, and they are all based on deep knowledge. Knowledge of products&mdash;your own products and your competitor&rsquo;s products&mdash;and knowledge of the specific needs that might be expressed when a competitor&rsquo;s product is the right product to recommend, based upon the discovered needs of the customer.</p><p> Finally, of course is the recognition of service to a community, in full knowledge that not all acts of service should result in a transaction. This service, however, will always build reputation. Sometimes we need Santa to remind us.</p><p> Have a wonderful 2016!</p>Published with acknowledgement to Thomson Carswell, publishers of the 2nd edition of Sales Force Management in the Financial Services by Paul K.

Now you&rsquo;re finally in charge of a team of people. You have the office you&rsquo;ve been wanting, you get to sit in on those top secret conference calls and you get to make decisions on how the budget is spent. You're on top of the world. Big things await you&hellip;right?</p><p> Soon after you settle in, your new team starts coming to you for advice, insight, ideas and direction; you&rsquo;re expected to run routine team meetings, have a planned agenda full of meaningful and productive topics, and you&rsquo;re even expected to **gasp** follow through. </p><p> Over time, you get through each day by making decisions on your own, then telling the team what comes next. You&rsquo;re consistently checking up on their progress, decisions and deadlines. Instead of wasting time consulting with your team on the direction something needs to go, or what will be next, you go ahead and make those decisions for everyone. Instead of spending time talking to your team about what they want to do next with their career, you just keep handing them work that surely makes them happy. It&rsquo;s just what you have to do to get through the day, right?</p><p> Congratulations. You&rsquo;re a manager. However, what decision makers often don&rsquo;t tell you when they put you in a managerial role is&hellip; <strong>  your team wants a leader. </strong> Not a manager.</p><p> <strong>  They want someone who: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Involves them in decision making </strong> - this includes the brainstorming that leads to the conclusion; as well as healthy discussions around the why and how behind a decision, change or certain direction. </li><li> <strong>  Isn&rsquo;t afraid to say that they can&rsquo;t do it all </strong>  - more specifically, someone who is good at delegating to those they know can carry the project through from start to finish. A good leader knows they have a good team behind them to get the job done, and knows just who to pass off the right work to. </li><li> <strong>  Trusts that their team is capable of getting things done </strong> - this means without the constant micro-management and time checking.</li><li> <strong>  Recognizes when there is a need for a change within the team </strong>  - identifying and confronting team issues and dynamics isn&rsquo;t an easy one, even for the best of leaders. But the strong leaders are those who can acknowledge the issue, address it, and follow through with their changes for the better of the team. </li><li> <strong>  Can admit when they&rsquo;re wrong </strong>  - being vulnerable does not make someone an incapable leader. In fact, it shows their team that they&rsquo;re just as human as the rest of them. This bravery, to show that you&rsquo;re not always right, is something that can earn the respect of not only your direct reports, but your colleagues.  <br/>  </li><p> Becoming a leader doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight and while some people are born with the capabilities to lead others, some can take a while longer to get the hang of it. As with anything, practice makes perfect. Either way, if you haven&rsquo;t already, one day you just might find yourself getting to choose what you do with this opportunity. </p><p> So which will you be?

{"original_id":3777,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Crippling Weight of Perfectionism","link":"the-crippling-weight-of-perfectionism","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve just joined a new gym &ndash; Virgin Active in Moore Park. It&rsquo;s a big, shiny, amazing facility that makes me want to go there even when I&rsquo;m not exercising.</p><p> As part of my package, I got 4 sessions with a personal trainer, Laura. As she put me through my paces (lots of bear crawls &ndash; I hate bear crawls), we got talking.</p><p> Laura is a fit individual. She&rsquo;s got the kind of female physique that&rsquo;s more &ldquo;power &amp; Rhonda Rousey&rdquo; than &ldquo;stick thin and addicted to Instagram&rdquo;. She&rsquo;s very passionate about taking the message to young women that looking and feeling good should include weight training.</p><p> As she smashed me on shoulder presses, she told me a bit about her background. Business degree, year of travel, successfully launched a new cafe in two weeks, key sales role at Virgin leading to becoming a PT.</p><p> She wants more though. She wants her own big-time business, to take her message to the world and become a super successful entrepreneur. I asked how far she&rsquo;d got. She told me she hadn&rsquo;t started, but she had lots of ideas.</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never failed at anything&rdquo;, she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to start now&rdquo;</p><p> So began another really interesting conversation with yet another super-smart, highly motivated person caught up with having it &ldquo;just right&rdquo; before putting it all out there.</p><p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a perfectionist, right?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p> &ldquo;Totally&rdquo;, she said. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p><p> There&rsquo;s a Betrand Russell quote I love. \"The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts&rdquo;.  </p><p> It speaks volumes to me about why there are so many truly top-notch advisers struggling in business, whilst lesser colleagues achieve greater success. It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with intelligence. Quite the opposite.</p><p> Time to be honest with yourself. The lesson is this.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve got perfectionism in your business make-up, you are stopping yourself experiencing better results.  If you want to improve your finances, life, business and pretty much every other aspect of your existence, you MUST lose the need for everything to be 100% flawless before you move forward.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re waiting for the right moment to start work on taking your advice business to new levels, you&rsquo;ve missed the point.</p><p> If your world view is built on the idea you&rsquo;ll get your offer right in your own head THEN launch, you&rsquo;re wasting time.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re still holding out for the perfect SOA template, or the perfect CRM to solve all your business&rsquo;s issues, you&rsquo;ll be waiting a while.</p><p> If your plan is to just wait until you&rsquo;ve got some headspace to change things, then that headspace will never come.</p><p> If you just need one more client to start thinking about the next phase of growth, you&rsquo;ll always need just one more client.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re going to put up with everything you hate about your business for just another few months before you do something different, you&rsquo;ll probably be telling yourself the same thing this time next year.</p><p> There will always be just one more tweak to make, just one more client to get or just one more issue to bed down before you do some real work on business building.</p><p> Meanwhile, those who don&rsquo;t need it to be 100% before putting it out there, and understand that the ever-evolving chaos of new challenges and potential distraction IS their business, they are racing ahead on a very different growth path.</p><p> In a few days, it&rsquo;ll be 2016. Hopefully you will have had an awesome period of reflection. Maybe you&rsquo;ve recharged some batteries, managed to clear the fog from your head.</p><p> There will never be a better time in the next 12 months to take steps to get it done. To plan out what you are going to do from the helicopter view of clarity and JUST ACT.</p><p> Whether you do it with your business partners, on your own, or with your BDM, book some time NOW.</p><p> Identify 3 things you&rsquo;re going to get done between now and March and complete your first step, no matter how small, in the first 48 hours after you get back into the office.</p><p> Then repeat every week until March.

{"original_id":3778,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Get Quality Referrals And Valuable Introductions","link":"how-to-get-quality-referrals-and-valuable-introductions","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> How to get referrals &ndash; if it&rsquo;s not on your mind already, it should be. Wonder why? <br/>  </h3><p> According to Hinge Marketing ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/book-inside-the-buyers-brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Inside The Buyer&rsquo;s Brain&rdquo;  </a> </u> ), when looking for a new professional services firm, over 70% of B2B buyers turn to a friend or colleague for a recommendation. To give you an idea of how important getting referrals and introductions really is, consider the following. In the same study, &ldquo;using a (pre existing) internal list&rdquo; (#3 ranked factor) and &ldquo;online search&rdquo; (#4) were used by buyers to find new suppliers in &hellip; 11% of cases.</p><p> In other words, buyers are  7 times more likely to find potential suppliers for future projects through referrals and introductions than via Google.</p><p> <strong>  Understanding how to ask for and get referrals is crucial to sales success. </strong></p><p> In the study,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/book-inside-the-buyers-brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hinge goes on to highlight  </a> </u>  that &ldquo;60% of buyers are very willing to recommend their service providers.&rdquo; The most common factor buyers cite for not providing a referral ? &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t been asked&rdquo; (72%). In other words: over 70% of B2B buyers say referrals are the #1 way they find new potential vendors. And over 60% of buyers are very willing to refer their current vendors to other buyers &ndash; if only someone asked them to.</p><p> Understanding how to get referrals means understanding basic human psychology. There are three core &ldquo;golden rules&rdquo; that impact your ability to get referrals and introductions: reciprocity, reward and risk.</p><p> <strong>  Golden Rule #1. Reciprocity. </strong></p><p> Human beings are hardwired to give referrals; it&rsquo;s part of who we are. When someone presents us with a problem or challenge (like how to find a new service provider), our natural instinct is to want to be helpful. Yet, many sellers I speak to about how to get referrals don&rsquo;t feel comfortable outright asking for them. They are concerned about appearing too &ldquo;salesy&rdquo;, pushy or getting &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer. (Incidentally,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/book-inside-the-buyers-brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   according to Hinge  </a> </u>  only 3% buyers indicated &ldquo;not being satisfied enough with their current provider&rdquo; as a reason to deny a referral request.)</p><p> Tactic:  Probably the easiest, safest and most comfortable way to get more referrals is to start by first giving them. And they don&rsquo;t even have to be sales-focused referrals either; I routinely introduce people with similar roles, work in similar industries, live in the same place or even work in the same company. By simply introducing people (with likely shared interests) to each other, you will gradually become known as a connector &ndash; and when asked, people will gladly return the favour and introduce you to their network.</p><p> <strong>  Golden Rule #2. Reward. </strong></p><p> In spite of our selfless motivations and innate desire to help others, at the same time most of us also seek some form of reward for our actions. Rewards come in many forms: they can be intangible (for example, the pleasure we derive from helping someone out), or tangible (for example, a referral fee). They can be short term or long term. They can be financial or emotional. They can be large or small. Substantial or (virtually) inconsequential.</p><p> Tactic:  the more layers of reward you can stack on top of each other, the more inclined others will be to provide you with referrals. Don&rsquo;t just ask for a referral; make it clear how making the connection will help the person giving the referral and the person receiving it.</p><p> <strong>  Golden Rule #3. Risk. </strong></p><p> I often refer to risk as &ldquo;the forgotten factor&rdquo;. In business, no decision is ever made without considering risk. The same is true for referrals. The largest risk holding people back from making a referral is their perceived fear of &ldquo;losing face&rdquo;, or damaging their relationship with the person they are referring you to.</p><p> Tactic:  the simplest and most effective way to help them get over that fear is by simply addressing it head on &ndash; and clarifying how you&rsquo;ll never, ever betray their trust. Make it clear you&rsquo;re not going to &ldquo;give them the hard sell&rdquo;, but merely looking to start up a conversation. Outline how you&rsquo;re going to deliver value from the start, and at every major interaction. Help them realise you&rsquo;re aware of how sacred relationships are, and would never do anything to jeopardise theirs.</p><p> Developing a deep understanding of how to get referrals (and how to give them in exchange) can be one of the most powerful things you can do to boost your sales career, or build your business.</p><p> <strong>  If sales is a people business, then connecting with people is what generates that business. </strong></p><p> So next time you&rsquo;re wondering how to get more referrals, start by answering the following questions:</p><li> Who can I introduce, make a referral or introduction today ?</li><li> What value can I deliver to both parties when I am being introduced ?</li><li> How can I minimise the risk of making an introduction ?</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-30 20:29:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-30 20:29:16.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_4JkCyEX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-quality-referrals-and-valuable-introductions/\", \"post_id\": \"8317\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-30 20:29:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-30 20:29:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-quality-referrals-and-valuable-introductions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8316\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3914\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-to-Get-Quality-Referrals-and-Valuable-Introductions-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"649\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451739600,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}

He might have said: &ldquo;To be a leader is to be misunderstood.&rdquo;</p><p> Yesterday I spoke with a founder of a very successful company with 25 years of measurable success and a remarkable reputation in her field, and yet when we talked about her vision and purpose she admitted &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear in my head &hellip; but nobody else seems to get it.&rdquo; She is incredibly clear about her vision when speaking outside the company, to clients and partners and friends like me. So why the disconnect?</p><p> I&rsquo;ve had the great honor of working with some amazing leaders in my time &hellip; creative, innovative, future-focused, visionary &hellip; and most of them at one time or another have had a hard time being understood by the very people poised to help them bring their vision to life: their employees.</p><p> The lone entrepreneur has no need to think about and plan internal and leadership communications. (We will always, it seems, make sense to ourselves.) But add employees, first 5, then 10, then 100 and effective leadership communications will make all the difference &hellip; to speed, alignment and results.</p><p> <strong>  As a leader/founder ask yourself: </strong></p><li> Are you the only one in your company who can make strategic decisions?</li><li> When you are not involved in a project, does it veer significantly off course?</li><li> Do your leaders wait for your direction before proceeding, even on seemingly low-priority activities?</li><li> Do you receive requests for resources and budget for irrelevant projects and programs?</li><li> Are you involved in the minutia, unable to find time for &ldquo;big thinking&rdquo; and strategy?</li><li> Do you send direction to your team, only to find they have not acted because they did not understand what you wanted them to do? <br/>  </li><p> If you answered yes to any of these questions, you have a leadership communications breakdown, and it probably starts with the most fundamental building blocks of an aligned organization: a clear and compelling purpose and vision, well articulated and consistently communicated by you, the leader, so that all parts and people in your organization can align themselves and their work with it.</p><p> Your goals in leadership communication? For your employees to hear you and your story, know how to act on what you say, and understand it well enough to tell it to others in their own words. If they do not, and can not, then you have not.</p><p> To paraphrase Shaw, the biggest problem with leadership communication is the illusion it has occurred. When I say &lsquo;communicated by you&rsquo; I do not mean just once at an all associate meeting, but over and over again. Leadership communication is not an event, but an ongoing process. Just when you become exhausted with the telling of your story, tell it again, and just then perhaps, it will begin to sink in. Leadership communications is a daily responsibility of sharing your story and helping people have insights about their connection with it. And you can&rsquo;t do it alone. You must invest time in creating the tools, sharing the story and empowering people to support you.</p><p> <strong>  How do you know you&rsquo;ve done it? </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-30 20:38:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-30 20:38:08.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_NXX7qqM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-illusion-of-leadership-communications/\", \"post_id\": \"8319\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-30 20:38:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-30 20:38:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-illusion-of-leadership-communications\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8318\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3915\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-Illusion-of-Leadership-Communications-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1044\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451588400,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3782,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Customer Service and Experience Trends You Can't Ignore","link":"five-customer-service-and-experience-trends-you-cant-ignore","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Business Trends <br/>  </h3><p> Happy New Year! As we close out the year and begin a new one, I thought about what has been trending over the last year or so and what will be important for us to consider as we move forward. Here are just five, but I think a very important five, trends to consider.</p><li> Your customers are smarter than ever before. When it comes to customer service, they know the difference between good and bad service. They not only compare you to others in your industry, but also others outside of your industry. They see companies advertising how great their customer service is, the awards they are winning for the customer experience, and more. Business is creating an expectation that forces us to raise the bar on our customer service and customer experience. By the way, that&rsquo;s a good thing.</li><li> If you haven&rsquo;t already done so, it&rsquo;s time to have self-service customer service as an option. This isn&rsquo;t limited to the companies that have call or support centers. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what type of business you&rsquo;re in, your customers will always have questions. Make it easy for them to find the Post an FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) section on your website. Post YouTube videos that answer questions that your customers might have.</li><li> Social media and customer service belong together. I can&rsquo;t believe how many companies don&rsquo;t monitor the social media channels their customers hang out on. It is imperative that you watch and listen for comments, both good and bad, and respond to Engaging with your customers on  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-care/social-media-response-time-are-you-fast-enough/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social channels  </a> </u>  is part of the customer experience. Don&rsquo;t fight it. Take advantage of it.</li><li> Smart phones are getting smarter and smarter. For some, the least important part of the smart phone is the phone. It is the device customers are using to connect with you and your company. They are looking at your website, your products, descriptions, reviews, and more. This is an important step in their buying process. Make sure you are mobile-ready and taking advantage of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/buyer-behavior-is-changing-faster-than-ever-due-to-technology/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   smart phone  </a> </u>  revolution.</li><li> The handwritten thank you note will never lose relevance. As a matter of fact, it may be more relevant than ever. A good old-fashioned thank you note will make you stand out. Can&rsquo;t write a note? Consider a thoughtful and personal email or text message. The key is the two words thoughtful and personal. Thanking your customer from that mindset warms up the message and makes your customers truly feel appreciated. Don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to add a positive &ldquo;moment&rdquo; to your customers&rsquo; experience. <br/>  </li><p> These are just five of the many trends that are happening in the world of customer service and customer experience. I wanted to share ideas that you could do as an individual, such as number five, as well as ideas that your company might consider implementing, if they aren&rsquo;t already doing so.</p><p> So, Happy New Year! May this coming year be your best year yet!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-30 21:22:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-30 21:22:08.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_UZ62mkM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-customer-service-and-experience-trends-you-cant-ignore/\", \"post_id\": \"8324\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-30 21:22:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-30 21:22:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-customer-service-and-experience-trends-you-cant-ignore\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8323\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3918\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-Customer-Service-Trends-You-Cant-Ignore-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"750\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451570400,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3783,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Inert Governments Incapable to Manage Digital Transformation","link":"inert-governments-incapable-to-manage-digital-transformation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Nowadays digital disruption is everywhere. No industry will be able to avoid digital disruption in the next 20 years. &lsquo;If&rsquo; should not be the questions, but &lsquo;when&rsquo;. Therefore, it&rsquo;s crucial that businesses, regardless they are SMEs or enterprises, need to start their digital transformation. Actually, they should have started yesterday. A lot of businesses in the private sector are dealing with digital issues, but they are struggling to continuously adjust to the fast going technology changes. How about the public sector? How does digital disruption emerge in a government? After all, government is not immune to the impacts of this upcoming industrial revolution.</p><p> The failed implementation of enterprise resources in many governments is a classic example of expectations falling short due to a failure to change processes. When it comes to IT projects alone, governments&rsquo; reputations are unsavoury. Digital disruption needs much more than just IT and it&rsquo;s more than just providing online services. The impact of the digital era is already noticeable and will eventually re-define the operational model of governments. This will change the relationship with citizens, internal procedures and cost structures. More important, it needs a drastic turn in legislative processes.</p><h3> Build a digital capability architecture <br/>  </h3><p> The described variables all play an important role. In current state they predict a very long way to go for most governments. Especially when they are not able to accelerate their pace. Governments somehow have all one determining factor; they continue operating slow and in an old fashion way. Furthermore, they all seem to have a conservative approach to disrupting changes. This makes it impossible to achieve digital transformation or disruption of any kind. Governments need a clear digital strategy combined with an innovative culture and visionary leadership to drive the transformation and deal with the consequences.</p><p> What does digital transformation actually mean? Well, therefore I would like to quote from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/What-is-government-as-a-platform-and-how-do-we-achieve-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   an article  </a> </u>  I recently read:</p><p> &ldquo;Digital transformation means gradual transition to an underlying business model that exploits ubiquitous web-based infrastructure to enable commonly shared capabilities. This definition would surprise most within government. When the business model of government is progressively based on shared capabilities, enabled by utility technology and web-based infrastructure, we can expect radical disruption of the market, opening up opportunities for innovation and investment by citizens, public, private, and third sectors alike &ndash; unleashing unprecedented innovation, efficiency, and savings.&rdquo;</p><p> So, in short, it&rsquo;s about a step by step change into a business model that endorses a platform to enable common capabilities. In my opinion there&rsquo;s more to it. For example, it requires building a culture that embraces change and it needs a facilitating role that stimulates co-creation. The government as a platform is the ultimate technology disruption within any public sector. But that should not only be about providing online services. Thinking forward about adapting or creating laws that intercept the challenge of the new world this digital revolution will bring forth. Privacy and security are the key elements here. But before governments can deal with this, they have to change their value chain.</p><h3> Break down silo&rsquo;s <br/>  </h3><p> Businesses don&rsquo;t run on isolated departments anymore. Working in silo&rsquo;s is one of the conservative obstacles that are withholding governments from evolving. There is no full insight of the public sector as a whole. To obtain such insights you need a digital strategy that defines the right infrastructure, the right skills for employees and processes that empower cooperation.</p><h3> Enable co-creation <br/>  </h3><p> Co-creation is one of the most powerful facilitators of innovation and disruption. To facilitate co-creation, the government should provide datasets for other public departments to explore or even  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/Can-Co-ops-Disrupt-the-New-App-Based-Economy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cooperate with third parties  </a> </u>  from the private sector. Governments must take on the roles of a facilitator and enabler. They should collaborate with other sectors in creating new solutions, optimised public services and new businesses. Unfortunately, most government agencies are not organised. This is where the &lsquo;doom to failure&rsquo; starts and the harmonising is stranded even before it started. Up to now they lack the ability to operate as flexible as private businesses. On this part, digitisation of government probably needs strong input and resources from private businesses. Governments need the agility in order to deal with the constant changing privacy and security issues that the e-revolution will bring forth.</p><h3> Defining a clear regulation strategy: privacy and security <br/>  </h3><p> Local regulations will determine where organisations do business. When regulations are setting to many boundaries, it would only be smart for organisations to move their business elsewhere. Although increasing knowledge is broadening the world, capabilities that are developing through that knowledge cause an opposite effect: It makes our world a smaller place. Doing business internationally becomes easier.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/privacy-and-security-in-the-internet-age/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Privacy and security in the internet age  </a> </u>  are becoming more crucial than ever. Considering that many governments are trying to regulate today&rsquo;s digital developments with legislation dating from over 20 years ago, it is fair to say that regulatory systems are an increasing risk. Time for a new era. Digital technologies are set to transform many public and private sectors; the world needs a reliable, trustworthy and secure cyberspace. Therefore, governments should aim for a harmonised approach to achieve a high degree of interoperability and compatibility of systems. It is important that they come up with umbrella regulations like Europe is doing with the  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\" target=\"_blank\">   GDPR  </a> </u> . Besides that, we need clear rules that govern dilemma&rsquo;s such as ownership, management and exploitation of digital data.</p><p> Governments worldwide mostly seem to be afraid of losing money because of the digital transformation. In fact, they will lose money (and credibility) if they don&rsquo;t anticipate on this E-revolution. They are not able to stop it anyway, so it would be best if they embrace it. Their future core business would entail the setup of a level playing field for this whole new ballgame. Let them become the team players that offer innovative progress and protection.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-30 21:37:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-30 21:37:07.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_6eIWyu1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/inert-governments-incapable-to-manage-digital-transformation/\", \"post_id\": \"8326\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-30 21:37:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-30 21:37:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"inert-governments-incapable-to-manage-digital-transformation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8325\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3919\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Inert-Governments-Incapable-to-Manage-Digital-Transformation-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"716\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451577600,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3784,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Only Intention You Need For The Upcoming Year","link":"the-only-intention-you-need-for-the-upcoming-year","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Ahhh, New Years. The time of year when people take stock of where they are, set an intention/resolution, and swear that this time things will be different. Sound familiar? </p><p> \"This will be the year when I:</p><p> a) Get in shape/healthy/laid</p><p> b) Give up smoking/alcohol/gluten</p><p> c) Find the perfect job/partner/cheesecake recipe\"</p><p> And while all those are desirable changes, they don&rsquo;t really matter.</p><p> Hear me out. I&rsquo;m all for making changes, growing, and creating a life you love. But chances are that what you&rsquo;re truly seeking won&rsquo;t come from a number on a scale or in your bank account. And that&rsquo;s because the goal of every goal is happiness.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say your goal is to find a better job. You may think that a new job will help you to spend more time with your family, buy a nicer car, or even get more sleep. And sure, it may. But ultimately, isn&rsquo;t the purpose behind all those intentions the feeling of joy? And wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could cut straight to the part where you feel great without having to wait for your boss to realize your worth?</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;m not selling complacency or a hokey meditation CD. I think happiness takes hard work. Just not the kind of hard work we&rsquo;re used to. We spend so much time pursuing validation and external happiness that we don&rsquo;t realize that we&rsquo;re caught in a cycle of effort, achievement, excitement, and ensuing crash.</p><p> And after riding that crazy carnival ride for what feels like forever, I&rsquo;ve decided that the best course of action is to do what&rsquo;s right for me and f**k everything else.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s because there are 2 ways to feel happy:</p><li> You can set goals like the ones above and slowly chip away at the things that aren&rsquo;t working, doing lots of guesswork as to which goals will bring about the outcome you want to feel.</li><li> Or, you can choose what&rsquo;s best for you and allow things to naturally fall into place. <br/>  </li><p> So how do you do that in a practical and meaningful way?</p><h3> Live In Alignment. <br/>  </h3><p> Change the &ldquo;rules you must follow&rdquo; to mean living what you deeply feel is true to you.</p><p> Change &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; from the feeling you get from external gains to the feeling you get when you live in alignment with your truth. (Reading how cheesy that sounds just made me puke a little, but I stand by it.)</p><p> Let me give you an example from this past year. In 2015, I came close to marrying someone who wasn&rsquo;t right for me. Having picked out the ring, we began planning our future. And while I thought that our life together would make me happy, I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the truth: the cost of being in that relationship meant giving up who I was. And that&rsquo;s a price I&rsquo;m not willing to pay. Living in alignment meant making the painful decision to leave the relationship. It meant listening to that nagging voice in your head, no matter whether or not I liked it. In the short term, alignment felt like shit. However, it paved the way for more happiness than I thought possible.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s because living in alignment means getting out of your own way. It means allowing joy to flow in simply by choosing to stop blocking it. When we create space for good things to come in, that's when the magic happens. So how do you do this?</p><h3> Ask Yourself:</h3><li> In what areas of my life and I not being true to myself?</li><li> In what areas am I not expressing myself fully?</li><li> In what areas am I not respecting my boundaries or allowing others not to respect them?</li><li> In what areas do I feel one way, but act another?</li><li> What parts of me would I like to cultivate more of? <br/>  </li><p> Once you&rsquo;ve identified the areas in which you&rsquo;ve turned your back on yourself, act on it. Without exception. Sound extreme? That&rsquo;s because it is. Returning to authenticity comes with a price. Leaving situations that no longer serve you may mean cutting ties with people and places you&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to. It may feel like the world is ending. And in some ways it is. The world in which you need to compromise who you are to feel fleeting happiness is over. And while it can be painful, it comes with a feeling of calm, surrender, and relief. Those three ingredients combine to create lasting joy. And whether you choose the cycle of achievement/crash or living in alignment, make your decision decisively. Do it consciously so you don&rsquo;t spend another year wondering how you got the results you have.</p><h3> The Takeaway: <br/>  </h3><p> This year, screw your resolution.

{"original_id":3785,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Awaken the Force: Six Powerful Commitments for 2016","link":"awaken-the-force-six-powerful-commitments-for-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As December comes to a close, many of us will do a &ldquo;year in review&rdquo; (and if we don&rsquo;t, Facebook will do it for us).  A lot of us will also think about how we can succeed in the year to come.I have long stopped doing &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s resolutions&rdquo; since I&rsquo;ve repeatedly lost and gained back the same 10 pounds I have been resolving to lose since 2001. Instead, I try to look for a handful of key behaviors that I can focus on in the coming year. This year I am committing to 6 actions that I believe are &ldquo;force&rdquo; multipliers (tools that amplify effort). The first four were included in a parenting book I wrote in 1998 (long before I first sought to lose those 10 pounds).Here are my 6 commitments for 2016, I will be asking you to share your targets at the end of this post: <strong>  Show-up: </strong>  Surely, you have run across people who perpetually make excuses or you&rsquo;ve had interactions with those who seem to be in a constant state of &ldquo;trying.&rdquo; By contrast, I am convinced that much success comes to people who just consistently show-up to fulfill their commitments. <strong>  Pay Attention:  </strong>  Even when people do show-up these days, they are often distracted. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a notification chime signifying the arrival of a text message or maybe it&rsquo;s a random thought that prompts an internet search but no matter the cause, their body is in one place and their attention is somewhere else. Focused attention directed to the people (not the technology) that surrounds us may be one of the greatest sources of interpersonal power in the year ahead. <strong>  Tell the Truth:  </strong>  Maybe I have just been worn down by the early political season but I have come to learn that half-truths, cover-ups, a lack of transparency, and outright deception robs us of our integrity and a deep-seated sense of trustworthiness. I remember once hearing that the worst thing about lying isn&rsquo;t that you won&rsquo;t be believed but that you can&rsquo;t believe. <strong>  Enjoy the Journey:  </strong> I have always loved to fish, but when I was younger, the success of a fishing trip was determined by how many fish I caught. Nowadays I can fish in my bathtub, although one has to be careful with the hooks.  If sustained happiness is a matter of &ldquo;wanting what you have,&rdquo; joy comes from enthusiastically embracing all elements of the journey &ndash; those days of bountiful catch and the ones where you return home with an empty creel. <strong>  Practice Gratitude: </strong>  All of us stand on the shoulders of giants. I look at the buildings, parks, roads, and utilities in my community and I am so grateful for those who created the infrastructure that operates in the background of my everyday life. That gratitude is compounded when I think about those who established our system of government and the ones who have fought for our freedom.  It is easy to get swept into &ldquo;media-fueled&rdquo; rants or to get disheartened by pithy, anonymous jabs hurled on social media posts. But the adage, &ldquo;you are what you eat&rdquo; can be widened to &ldquo;you are what you consume&rdquo; in a broader social context.  If you focus on the negative, your worldview is shaped accordingly. Now gratitude&hellip;.that is something to feast upon! <strong>  Serve Well:   </strong> A number of years ago I read an insightful book titled  <strong>  The Rise of Selfishness in America  </strong> written by James Lincoln Collier. Upon completion, I was compelled all the more to realize that selfishness like righteousness is a dead end in life and in business. What if you are right and the customer is wrong or if you get your needs met but your partner doesn&rsquo;t?  Does that mean (in the words of Charlie Sheen) you are &ldquo;winning?&rdquo; With my advancing age, I&rsquo;m certain of less and less&hellip;but this I know to be true.  It is through &ldquo;otherness&rdquo; and service that we matter!Ok now it&rsquo;s time for me to post this and read it regularly to stand behind these commitments in 2016&hellip;. So have you crafted your commitment targets yet and have you determined where will you post them? How about we revisit ours about this time next year?By the way, thanks for showing up, paying attention, and looking for the positive in this and my many posts this past year. <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"May the Force Be With You\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20.png\"/> </a></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-30 21:49:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-30 21:49:45.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_sEPBWs8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/awaken-the-force-six-powerful-commitments-for-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8330\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-30 21:49:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-30 21:49:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"awaken-the-force-six-powerful-commitments-for-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8329\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3921\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Awaken-the-Force-Six-Powerfil-Commitments-for-2016.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"775\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451655000,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3786,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Do I Find Ideal Capacity in My Financial Advisor Practice?","link":"how-do-i-find-ideal-capacity-in-my-financial-advisor-practice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I have a theory. A theory based on 26 plus years of experience in the financial industry. I hit capacity hard twice in my practice over 20 years and it was not a fun time. A financial advisor and or their team hits capacity, but does nothing about it. Eventually they surpass capacity and eventually things start to cause problems. Staff get frustrated, long hours persist, problems at home come up and clients now start to have issues. Sound familiar. At some-point passing capacity hit us in our subconscious and we chose to ignore it. Eventually our subconscious goes into overdrive and problems start to appear. Someone besides yourself discover that you are past capacity. After all, you ignored the warning signs from the the staff sometimes from your clients, your family and yourself. Your subconscious kicks in and decides to take over. This is when clarity hits home that something has to be done. Advisors and teams with a coach or accountability person usually never get to this point if they listen to their coach. But advisors or small business owners tend to ignore the signs as their experience tells them to keep going. Eventually it will work out, we will get past it and persist. Your subconscious is telling you that your life and lifestyle are being sacrificed and the question &ldquo;is it all really worth it, and why am I doing all of this&ldquo; jumps into your head from nowhere. You start asking bigger questions for a reason. Is this business worth it? Maybe I should just sell because I am not enjoying it anymore. More questions come from your subconscious as the days get longer and longer. How can you solve all of the the problems of over capacity in the short run? You think it is as easy as working harder and harder. After all, that is what you have always done, but in the long run your subconscious knows this is not the answer.</p><h3> What is the answer in the long run? <br/>  </h3><p> Not an easy question but it lies within the capacity triangle. The capacity triangle is ideal capacity, ideal business and ideal lifestyle. First, what lifestyle are you trying to create? Second, is your business congruent with this or is your ego getting in the way? Yes I said ego, as awards, conferences and industry accolades all vie for attention from your ego. We respect the advisor that spends a lot of time with their family and also respect top producers and their accomplishments. But each person can accomplish both by expanding and innovating their thinking. It is simple, but it is not easy to do. <br/> <br/> Let me give you some perspective. Why is it that some advisors can manage hundreds of millions of dollars of client&rsquo;s wealth, with a large team of staff, client demands, who takes time for their family and keep it all in check. In other words, achieve some personally comforting form of balance in their life? What is the secret to accomplishing ideal capacity? <br/> <br/> What is their secret? Are they great marketers, business builders or just have great habits? Sure it is all of the above, but the one thing they learned to manage the best is their powerful subconscious. Learning to manage guilt, ego, stress, and learn to listen to their inner voice that can guide them in good and bad times.</p><h3> Good habits can lead you off course <br/>  </h3><p> Some say it is good habits, but even good habits can lead you astray. For example let&rsquo;s say you run a successful practice, have several ideal families or clients you look after. You are disciplined to grow your financial advisory practice, because of your good habits you continue to grow the business. Eventually theses good habits cause you to hit capacity, or worse, build way past capacity. Now what? Do you continue your good habits and grow your practice, even when it cuts into family or personal time? Hey, when I was young and single running a practice, I just kept on working, while friends were going out having a good time. I sacrificed some of my personal time in order to grow the business. We all do it. But then something gives. What then? You are pushed into a corner. You must make decisions, all with good and potentially bad consequences. Which angle do you choose? Capacity, lifestyle or business? Either way, if you choose business or lifestyle you have not chosen to tackle capacity, unless, when you choose business, you work on your business and work on tackling capacity. But I highly doubt it, because it usually takes a second set of eyes to set the record straight on capacity.</p><h3> Get out of your own way <br/>  </h3><p> We get in our own way most of the time. It takes a, family member, close friend, sometimes a colleague, even your own staff or manager to let you know when you are well past capacity. <br/> <br/> Even more importantly, your coach or mentor is the one who can spot it a mile away. Let&rsquo;s face it, you are superman, you can handle it, you keep telling yourself. No problem, just dig in and it will get better. You have been through it before and survived. How can you not only stop the crazy circle of working past capacity, but change it for the better. That is what tackling capacity is all about. Albert Einstein wrote &ldquo;The significant problems we face cannot be changed with the same level of thinking as when we created them&rdquo;. So how do we change our thinking? <br/> <br/> As Steven Covey wrote in his famous book&rdquo; 7 Habits of Highly Successful People&rdquo; Simon &amp; Schuster Publishing; Anniversary Edition (Nov. 19 2013) &ldquo; Begin with the end in mind. As Simon Sinek write in his book &ldquo;Start with Why&rdquo; by Portfolio Publishing; Reprint edition (Dec 27 2011) &ldquo;What is your why? What is it all for? Start with the most important things first, not second or third or last, first. In my case, it was family. Everything else seemed simple after that. If you are looking for help with capacity, consider our &ldquo;Capacity Innovation Program&rdquo; at Advisor Practice Management.  <strong>  Now turn your phone or computer off and plan to focus on the most important thing first this holiday season. </strong> Trust me, the work will still be there next year.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-12-30 21:57:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-12-30 21:57:42.000000","image_url":"2015/12/article_placeholder_F9RWFyd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-do-i-find-ideal-capacity-in-my-financial-advisor-practice/\", \"post_id\": \"8332\", \"post_date\": \"2015-12-30 21:57:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-12-30 21:57:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-do-i-find-ideal-capacity-in-my-financial-advisor-practice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8331\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3922\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/How-Do-I-Find-Ideal-Capacity-in-My-Financial-Advisor-Practice-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1136\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451555100,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3787,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Annuities Guarantee","link":"annuities-guarantee","source_link":null,"content":"My first at bat in Little League baseball didn&rsquo;t go well. I was hit in the head with an errant pitch. Every at bat thereafter, I would close my eyes and flinch when the ball came whizzing by. Needless to say, my baseball career was short-lived.<h3> Today, I have a similar internal flinch whenever I mention annuities or whole life insurance in a column. I know that comments from insurance salespeople casting aspersions on my IQ and my character will start whizzing into my inboxes.</h3>Admittedly, I am no fan of most \"investment\" products sold by life insurance companies. I believe most life insurance companies do a great service providing low-cost term life insurance and a big disservice promoting high-cost, low-return investment products. Life insurance salespeople disagree with me about my views, and they let me know it.Recently I wrote a column with the premise that, outside of a FDIC guaranteed bank account of up to $250,000, there is no \"guaranteed\" investment. My point was that only the Federal Reserve Bank, which owns the ability to create dollars at will, can be the ironclad guarantor of any dollar based investment. I flinched when I included annuities and whole life insurance in my list of non-guaranteed investments.Predictably, commenters told me I was wrong, that insurance companies routinely guarantee their returns on fixed annuities and cash value life insurance. Knowing that a guarantee is only a good as the company behind it, I dismissed the comments until one brought up a point I had not considered.This person wrote, \"If an insurance company goes bankrupt the South Dakota Guaranty Association guarantees payment up to $250,000.\" He is right; any annuity licensed to be sold in South Dakota is guaranteed for up to $250,000 per company by the South Dakota Life &amp; Health Insurance Guaranty Association (SDLHIGA). If you own three annuities, each worth $200,000, issued by the same company, only $250,000 is covered by the SDLHIGA.What is the SDLHIGA? It&rsquo;s a private association<u> <a href=\"https://sdlegislature.gov/statutes/Codified_laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Statute=58-29c-46&amp;Type=Statute\" target=\"_blank\">  created by the SD legislature </a></u>comprised of every life and health insurer licensed in South Dakota. All 50 states have similar associations. The SDLHIGA is not a state agency, nor does is have the power to access any state funding.If an insurance company that sells annuities or any life, health, disability, or long term care insurance files for bankruptcy, the SDLHIGA can ultimately take over funding the obligations of the policies. Payments are subject to a cap of between $100,000 and $500,000, depending upon the type of policy. You can view a complete list of the types of insurance covered and the limits at<u> <a href=\"http://www.sdlifega.org/faq.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  sdlifega.org </a></u>or call the SD Division of Insurance at 605-773-3563.While not a government guarantee, the SDLHIGA guarantee is certainly strong, as it is backed by all the member insurance companies. The downside to the guarantee is that your money will be \"locked up\" while the bankruptcy and receivership process wends its way through the courts. It could take at best months and often years before you would be able to receive your proceeds.You may wonder why you&rsquo;ve never heard of the SDLHIGA. That is because SD law prohibits insurance agents and their companies from using the guarantee in any advertising or as an inducement to buy life insurance products.Despite the guarantees offered by the SDLHIGA, it's still important that you protect yourself by researching potential investment products and only buying from financially sound companies. Guarantees are no substitute for doing your own due diligence as part of taking responsibility for your own financial well-being.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-02 15:20:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-02 15:20:23.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Pk490uU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/annuities-guarantee/\", \"post_id\": \"8334\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-02 15:20:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-02 15:20:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"annuities-guarantee\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8333\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3923\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Annuities-Guarantee.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"741\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451926800,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

One. That&rsquo;s enough.</p><p> This is the one-off part. Thank you to my friend Dr. Steve Broe, leadership coach, for reminding me of the importance of knowing what to STOP doing. As you commit to adding an activity, let go of something else you no longer wish to do. More than one activity may spring to mind. Good. Now keep it simple. 1 add, 1 remove. 1, not 10. That&rsquo;s how we create forward momentum instead of &ldquo;I wanna give up.&rdquo;</p><p> I have a bonus un-activity for your consideration.

Truth is, we don&rsquo;t. At work, in life, we don&rsquo;t. The moment we have a slither of unobligated time, we obligate it away. Often with activities we enjoy. Cool. Still obligated time.</p><p> Unobligated time is radical. Half a day. A Saturday morning perhaps. Longer if you wish. No plans. Imagine. You wake up. You may go for a run, you may not. You may drink a cup of coffee, you may not. You may read a book, you may not. You will eat not because it&rsquo;s time to eat but because you&rsquo;re hungry. You may get in your car and drive nowhere in particular.</p><h3> You get to listen to yourself. You get to choose.</h3><p> <br/> It sounds improbable, I know. You have a family. Your children need you. Your spouse craves quality time with you. You have friends who miss you.</p><p> Guess what. The folks you feel obligated to will be just fine, and you get to hear yourself.

{"original_id":3789,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Softening Statements to Get Prospects Talking","link":"softening-statements-to-get-prospects-talking","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of the objections I always get from sales people who don&rsquo;t want to use scripts is that they sound so, well, like scripts.  I tell them that if they sound like they are reading them, sure, but if they internalize them and then deliver them naturally, then they don&rsquo;t sound like scripts at all. </p><p> The other objection I get about using scripts is that many scripts sound very salesy.  They sound too direct and pushy.  Again, it&rsquo;s all about how you deliver them.  For example, are you matching the pacing of the person you&rsquo;re speaking with?  Are you using timing properly?  Are you hesitating and adding the right inflection at the right time? </p><p> You see, the great thing about scripts is that they afford you greater flexibility in not only what you&rsquo;re going to say, but, more importantly, how you say it.  And let&rsquo;s face it: inflection, pacing and tone are everything when you&rsquo;re selling over the phone.</p><p> The other great thing about a carefully crafted and delivered script is that you can use softening statements if you sense your prospect is getting irritated or short or is in a hurry.  If you have to ask for some sensitive information &ndash; like who your competition is, or what their budget is, or how they figure into the decision making process &ndash; you can preface your question with a softening statement to help bring the defenses of a prospect down, and to make yourself sound more natural, more real. </p><h3> Here are a variety of softening statements you can weave into your opening and closing scripts to help you connect with your prospect and to get them talking:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  For Opening Scripts: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking, can you tell me what you paid for that previously?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;And _________, obviously you&rsquo;re going to run this by others there &ndash; do you mind me asking how you figure into the final decision process?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo; _________, don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way &ndash; and I&rsquo;m only wanting to know for comparison purposes &ndash; but when you got (X product or service) last time, what did you end up paying for that?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo; _________, the only reason I&rsquo;m asking is that if you purchase (more than the normal amount or add on to the order) then I may be able to offer you a discount.  Hey, we all like to save money, right?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo; __________, I don&rsquo;t want to go above your head, but I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair for you to do my job for me &ndash; so do you mind if I ask if it&rsquo;s O.K. to speak with (the boss) briefly and answer any questions he has?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo; _________, do you mind if I ask you just a couple of quick questions to see whether or not this might be a fit for you?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;I promise I won&rsquo;t take a lot of your time &ndash; I know you&rsquo;re busy.

Do you mind if I just get an idea of what part of this is not resonating with you right now?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo; __________, please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m being too forward here &ndash; but after we&rsquo;re done and you&rsquo;ve learned everything about this, is it fair that I ask you for a simple yes or no?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo; _________, would you mind if I asked you: &lsquo;If the price on this was closer to what you felt comfortable spending, would this be the solution you&rsquo;d want to go with?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;I totally understand, believe me I do.  In addition to that, though, what else might be standing in the way of you saying yes to this?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Hey I get it &ndash; you have options and you want to talk to others.

{"original_id":3790,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Let's Be Nicer to #Millennials in 2016","link":"lets-be-nicer-to-millennials-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As we welcome 2016 with open arms, I propose you add another resolution to your list &ndash; &ldquo;Be Nicer to Millennials&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> In May 2010, The New York Post published an article called &ldquo;The Worst Generation?&rdquo; where it made sure to belittle the entire millennial cohort by using inappropriate adjectives to describe the leaders of tomorrow. Pretty bold&hellip;when you call 82M people lazy and entitled, especially when the youngest and oldest of the group would have only been 15 and 30 years old at the time.  Fast forward 5 years, and millennials are still being called names.  Granted, my generation has gotten some love too (appreciate it!), but for every positive reference, there is a stereotypical rebuttal. So, let me try defending my generation by translating the 2 most popular myths&hellip;and if I don&rsquo;t do us justice, just remain patient till we SHOW you what we&rsquo;re really made of.</p><h3> Lazy (at the workplace)                                                     </h3><p> <br/> I often hear &ldquo;people your age are so lazy and never want to do any work.&rdquo;  And I usually reply by asking &ldquo;what do you have them working on&rdquo; (depending on who it is obviously).  Most of the time, the work described sounds unfulfilling, boring, and easy.  Well, odds are that your &lsquo;lazy millennial&rsquo; has figured out a better, more efficient way to do the job, and that&rsquo;s why he/she is surfing the net whenever you pass by, but this is why it&rsquo;s important to understand the millennial mindset.  Once you&rsquo;ve unlocked this, you&rsquo;ll be able to better manage your millennials.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s replace &lsquo;lazy&rsquo; with &lsquo;not motivated&rsquo;.  How can you motivate a millennial?  And trust me, it&rsquo;s not through a game of ping pong, access to yoga studios, and free beer.  We&rsquo;re looking for more challenging projects, greater responsibility, open collaboration, and appropriate recognition.  Immersing us in this culture not only shows us that your expectations are high, but more importantly, you value our growth and success.  This will surely tap the &ldquo;do not disappoint&rdquo; voice in our heads.  Along with what we&rsquo;re looking for in the workplace, it&rsquo;s important to understand how we learn and digest information (side note: this isn&rsquo;t any different when managing non-millennials).  We are more result driven than process-oriented, so tell us what the end goal is FIRST and the purpose behind it, AND THEN explain the process to getting there.  Believe it or not, we can be very obedient when we know what the end game is.  So it&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re lazy and unmotivated, we&rsquo;re just looking to be engaged in a different way.</p><h3> Entitled</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s dissect why we&rsquo;re &lsquo;entitled&rsquo;.  Is it because we question the process, expect more from our employers, demand greater customer service, and prefer work/life integration?  In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, we live in an &lsquo;always-on&rsquo; world where technology allows us to be accessible from anywhere at anytime, and our expectation is that you reside in this SAME world.  So before &lsquo;lazy&rsquo;, &lsquo;entitled&rsquo;, &lsquo;coddled&rsquo;, or &lsquo;self-centered&rsquo; rolls off your tongue, consider that times have changed and the younger generation is &lsquo;in with the new and out with the old&rsquo;.  Work doesn&rsquo;t always have to happen between 9-5 in a cubicle, &lsquo;new patient&rsquo; forms don&rsquo;t have to be completed on clipboards (with those annoying pens) anymore, and local bank visits are totally unnecessary.  If you think the millennial is demanding too much and it&rsquo;s impacting your normal routine, then let me be the first to tell you, that their disruption will be the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo;.</p><p> In 2013, Time magazine published an article titled, &ldquo;Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation,&rdquo; where the author cited a study from the National Institutes of Health to point out 58% more college students scored higher on a narcissism test in 2009 than they did in 1982 (note to self: google why we&rsquo;re taking narcissism tests!?). So what does this test tell us? I THINK it tells us that we&rsquo;re the most &lsquo;narcissistic&rsquo;, socially responsible, eco-friendly, family-oriented, volunteering, voting generation&hellip;oh wait, that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p><p> In short, I know every generation has their hustlers and couch potatoes, but before you begin labeling all 82M of us yet another year, I urge you to think about the times millennials grew up in (the economic recession, 9/11, war on terror, and technological advances) and all the influencers that shaped us (our parent&rsquo;s over-the-top support, &lsquo;anything&rsquo;s possible&rsquo; motivational commencement speeches, and young global Nobel Prize winning activists). </p><p> So, in 2016, let&rsquo;s try to be nicer to millennials &ndash; just think about your favorite Gen Yer and see if they fit the negative labels (I&rsquo;m sure they will not).</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-02 16:35:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-02 16:35:54.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_uZaPNFW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/lets-be-nicer-to-millennials-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8339\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-02 16:35:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-02 16:35:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"lets-be-nicer-to-millennials-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8337\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3926\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Softening-Statements-to-Get-Prospects-Talking.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"794\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451919600,"author_id":444,"chart_url":""}

Yet, forty-six percent of these women cannot shake the fearfulness of the bag lady peril either.</p><p> As the study shows, financial companies (headed up and run mostly by men) are finally realizing that the insidiousness of the anxiety women feel because of the threat of this danger is actually valid in light of the fact that retirement age women face financial challenges that men do not.</p><p> If these financial companies really want to have a positive impact on the financial lives of women, they need to realize that women relate to money differently than men: for women money is an emotional subject; for men money is transactional.</p><p> Addressing the fears and other emotions women struggle with around the topic of money will serve the financial services industry well if they want to acquire the assets women stand to inherit over the next couple of decades.</p><p> Meanwhile, women need to step up to the plate and secure their own financial wellness. They need to give up the idea that someone else is going to look out for them. Their financial security is solely their responsibility. Not their husband&rsquo;s. Not their banker&rsquo;s. Not their parent&rsquo;s.</p><h3> Despite what we women have been socialized to accept, ultimately, no one will care about our financial future more than we do.</h3><p> <br/> Here are my four tips for women who want to take a stand for their financial security in retirement, starting TODAY:</p><li> <strong>  Decide what you want retirement to look like for you then take the steps necessary to plan for that. </strong> Studies show that when women have a plan (or at least the start of one), fear of the future starts to subside.</li><li> <strong>  Plan on outliving your husband or significant other. </strong> Also, plan on the worst case scenario in terms of what you will receive from their benefits. (Social Security is already taking steps to reduce benefits such as Spousal, Divorce and Survivor benefits, so you should not count on that.)</li><li> <strong>  Financial fear comes from &lsquo;not knowing.&rsquo; </strong> So, make a plan to increase your financial literacy by reading books about women, money and retirement; subscribing to financial podcasts; and taking classes on how to manage your money.</li><li> <strong>  In short, TAKE ACTION! </strong> Make it a point to learn something new every week about money and retirement. Start taking steps to create a plan you feel confident about. By this time next year, you&rsquo;ll be more financially savvy than you&rsquo;ve ever been. But most importantly, your bag lady fears will be reduced, or better yet, completely eliminated because your financial future will be in your control, not someone else&rsquo;s.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-02 16:47:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-02 16:47:05.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_WYSRzDR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-money-4-simple-steps-to-ditch-those-nagging-bag-lady-fears/\", \"post_id\": \"8341\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-02 16:47:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-02 16:47:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-money-4-simple-steps-to-ditch-those-nagging-bag-lady-fears\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8340\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3927\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Women-Money-4-Simple-Steps-to-Ditch-Those-Nagging-Bag-Lady-Fears.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"881\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451909700,"author_id":375,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s all about the power of now.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re still unconvinced about the very real imperative to get your financial services organisation in general, and your CEO in particular, with the social media program, then look no further than  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/social-media-dont-risk-not-risking-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> .</p><p> But even for those who&rsquo;ve joined the ranks of the converted (a.k.a. the 21st Century), some tips on what works best to build genuine engagement in the social sphere probably won&rsquo;t go astray.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve taken a look at what works for business and other leaders in the Twittersphere and compiled these suggestions to help you get it right first time.</p><h3> 1. Make it easy for people to identify you, especially if you have a common name. How? <br/>  </h3><li> Include your company name in the handle if possible like ANZ&rsquo;s Mike Smith (@MikeSmith_ANZ )</li><li> Refer or link to your company or LinkedIn profile in your bio.</li><li> Display your company logo or branding in your banner (see Perpetual&rsquo;s Geoff Lloyd ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffvLloyd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  @GeoffvLloyd </a> ).</li><li> Have a clear and visible photo, preferably a head-and-shoulders shot. <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Use your Bio</h3><p> <br/> Be clear about the purpose of your Twitter account and whether you only tweet about company news or if there other topics you&rsquo;re passionate (and willing to tweet) about. Examples:</p><li> Mike Smith&rsquo;s bio reads, &ldquo;Group CEO Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited. International banker, Asia-phile, adopted Aussie. Passionate about our customers, diversity champion.&rdquo;</li><li> Craig Keary &ndash; &ldquo;Senior Financial Services professional looking to make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives, Husband and Father, PhD student, Runner, Focussed on Innovation.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Follow the right people</h3><p> <br/> This dictates the type and quality of content you&rsquo;ll see. Consider following peers, colleagues, clients, brands in your industry, industry associations, brands or individuals you admire, competitors, key media publications or journalists, to name a few. Twitter is the best way to stay on top of breaking your news and of-the-moment happenings, so be discerning. If you&rsquo;re looking for suggestions, take a look at the Financial Standard&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.financialstandard.com.au/fspower50\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  #FSPower50 </a> .</p><h3> 4. Create lists</h3><p> <br/> A list is a curated group of Twitter users with similar interests or characteristics. You can create your own lists or subscribe to lists created by others. If you create your own you can make it public or private. Viewing a list timeline will show you a stream of tweets from only the users on that list &ndash; a great way to get your news in a segmented way. For instance the AFR Twitter account lists its journalists &ndash; good to help you stay in touch with financial news in Australia.</p><h3> 5. Engage with your audience</h3><p> <br/> Having a Twitter account with no activity isn&rsquo;t enough. You need to be active and provide useful and relevant information to your audience. Remember:</p><li> Listen before you engage, don&rsquo;t just jump into conversation without knowing the context.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t just &lsquo;broadcast&rsquo;. Respond, reply and engage.</li><li> Keep it consistent. Make sure the content you share aligns with the purpose of your Twitter account and bio. And that means making sure you&rsquo;re not absent from Twitter for long periods.</li><li> Make sure you respond to people who engage with you in a timely manner. Ensure your notifications are set appropriately so you can respond in real-time.</li><li> Aim to add value, don&rsquo;t bombard your audience with meaningless content. Quality over quantity. <br/>  </li><p> We&rsquo;re not pretending that launching into the Twittersphere is without complication or effort. But what is clear is that there are some set guidelines for doing it right. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-02 16:55:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-02 16:55:08.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_nyAzAJ9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-top-five-twitter-habits-of-very-effective-ceos/\", \"post_id\": \"8343\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-02 16:55:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-02 16:55:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-top-five-twitter-habits-of-very-effective-ceos\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8342\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3928\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Top-Five-Twitter-Habits-of-Very-Effective-CEOs.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"302\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451916000,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3794,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"2014 vs 2015: How Employee Engagement Has Changed in One Year","link":"2014-vs-2015-how-employee-engagement-has-changed-in-one-year","source_link":null,"content":"<p> At  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/?utm_source=unpaid&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=blogtrial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TINYpulse  </a> </u> , we pride ourselves on helping organizations better understand the people that power their businesses. We believe that employees are the most valuable assets of all organizations. Just like you wouldn&rsquo;t neglect your company&rsquo;s property, equipment, or financials, businesses can't take their employees for granted.</p><p> <strong>  To this end, each year we dig through thousands of survey responses to understand the state of employee engagement. </strong> This year, the results of that feedback were published in our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/lt-2015-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Employee Engagement Report  </a> </u> . Here are some of the report&rsquo;s highlights:</p><h3> 1. Employees love their coworkers</h3><p> According to more than 400,000 anonymous responses, employees agree that their coworkers are the number one reason they&rsquo;re excited to come to work each day.</p><h3> 2. But at the same time, delayed responses from said coworkers are the biggest productivity killers</h3><p> Though employees love working with the members of their team, those folks don&rsquo;t always move things along quickly. In fact, 35% of employees feel as though such delays were the most counterproductive with respect to their output.</p><h3> 3. A majority of workers feel like they have too much on their plates</h3><p> Nearly 70% of workers said they feel like they&rsquo;re not fulfilling all of the responsibilities of their jobs.</p><h3> 4. Not even one in three employees consider themselves to be strongly valued</h3><p> No matter how hard they work or how much they produce, a vast majority of workers feel as though they&rsquo;re easily replaceable and not highly favored.</p><h3> 5. Work culture strongly correlates with team happiness</h3><p> Our research indicates that the stronger and more enjoyable a corporate culture is, the more likely employees are to be happy.</p><h3> 6. Almost 25% of workers would leave for more money</h3><p> Nearly one out of every four members of your team would jump ship the second they received a job offer that came with a 10% pay increase.</p><h3> 7. Most workers feel as though there aren&rsquo;t enough opportunities for professional development</h3><p> Only 25% of workers feel as though there are strong opportunities for them to develop professionally &mdash; which is particularly discouraging, as millennials yearn to continue refining their skills.</p><h3> So what changed in a year?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  In 2014, we  <a href=\"http://www.tinypulse.com/2014-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    surveyed   </u>  </a>  over 200,000 workers from more than 500 companies to gauge employee engagement. Here&rsquo;s what employees said last year: </strong></p><h3> 1. Employees love their coworkers</h3><p> Workers don&rsquo;t go the extra mile for more money or more incentives. Rather, they do so because they love their coworkers and want to support their success.</p><h3> 2. Organizations don&rsquo;t have strong cultures</h3><p> A majority of employees (64%) don&rsquo;t believe that their organizations have strong work cultures.</p><h3> 3. Nearly half of employees aren&rsquo;t satisfied with their bosses</h3><p> 49% of survey respondents said they weren&rsquo;t happy with their direct supervisors.</p><h3> 4. More than 25% of workers don&rsquo;t have the tools they need to succeed</h3><p> Everywhere you look, there&rsquo;s news of new technologies and business philosophies that folks from all industries and verticals are using to improve business operations. That said, more than one in four workers don&rsquo;t have access to the tools they need to succeed at their jobs.</p><h3> 5. Employees like to encourage their peers when it&rsquo;s easy to do so</h3><p> The easier it is for employees to recognize their peers&rsquo; successes, the more likely they are to offer that recognition. Our research indicated that 44% of workers would leave positive feedback for their peers if there was an easy way to do so.</p><h3> 6. A little more than one in five workers feel valued</h3><p> A tragically low 21% of workers said they were strongly valued by their companies.</p><h3> 7. Most workers feel as though there aren&rsquo;t enough opportunities for professional development</h3><p> Last year, 66% of employees indicated that they didn&rsquo;t feel as though there were adequate opportunities for growth at their respective organizations.</p><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve digested an overview of the responses to our 2014 and 2015 employee engagement surveys, let&rsquo;s take a look at the direction engagement is moving and concrete steps your organization can take to improve employee engagement.</p><h3> So what exactly can you learn from two years of data? </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Here are some takeaways from our newest report: </strong></p><h3> 1. Employees love their coworkers, so tap into that camaraderie</h3><p> In both 2014 and 2015, employees indicated that they work as hard as they work because they care about the people they work with. Since that&rsquo;s the case, consider assigning more team projects and holding more out-of-the-office team-building exercises to strengthen that camaraderie even further.</p><h3> 2. Developing a strong culture should be a top priority</h3><p> In 2014, we found out that a majority of employees wouldn&rsquo;t describe their organization as having a strong culture. In 2015, we discovered that strong cultures are directly correlated with employee happiness. Take proactive steps to develop and refine your company culture. To do that, you first need to have a vision. Then you need to communicate that vision and support it with your actions.</p><h3> 3. It&rsquo;s imperative to invest in your technological infrastructure</h3><p> In 2014, we learned that roughly 25% of workers don&rsquo;t have access to the tools they need to succeed at work. In 2015, we found out that nearly 70% of workers feel as though they are unable to take care of all of their job responsibilities.</p><p> The takeaway? There&rsquo;s no sense in making your employees&rsquo; jobs any more difficult than they absolutely need to be. Invest in the right tools and technologies to help optimize workflow. Your employees will appreciate the investment. They&rsquo;ll be more productive, and your bottom line will improve.</p><h3> 4. You need to show your employees you appreciate them</h3><p> In both 2014 and 2015, we discovered that a vast majority of workers feel as though nobody values the work they do. Your employees are your organization&rsquo;s strongest assets. Be sure to go out of your way to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-18-creative-employee-recognition-ideas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   show them you appreciate their efforts  </a> </u> . To do that, you can write handwritten thank-you notes, praise those who deserve it in a very public setting, and offer small tokens of appreciation (e.g., a $25 Amazon gift card) when folks go above and beyond.</p><h3> 5. There aren&rsquo;t enough opportunities for professional development</h3><p> In both 2014 and 2015, a significant majority of employees indicated there weren&rsquo;t enough opportunities for professional development at their respective organizations. This is particularly troubling for businesses because millennials are keen on professional development. But there&rsquo;s a simple fix: whether it&rsquo;s allowing your employees to attend conferences a couple times a year or hosting a workshop once a quarter, be sure to help your employees develop.</p><p> With a new year right around the corner, now&rsquo;s as good a time as any to reassess your operations to determine how you can better serve your employees to increase engagement. Good luck!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-03 00:11:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-03 00:11:20.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_MSGObmm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/2014-vs-2015-how-employee-engagement-has-changed-in-one-year/\", \"post_id\": \"8347\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-03 00:11:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-03 00:11:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"2014-vs-2015-how-employee-engagement-has-changed-in-one-year\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8346\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3930\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Employee-Enagagement-Has-Changed-in-One-Year.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"463\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451903400,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3795,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 10 Things Top Performing Advisers Do Better","link":"the-10-things-top-performing-advisers-do-better","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Fred Dodds, CEO of Institute of Financial Advisers</p><p> One of the key themes for the IFA for 2014 is Being Successful on Purpose and at the recent MDRT meeting one of the best sessions I went to was by a George Hartman who examined the 10 things that top-performing advisers seem to do better than most other advisers.</p><h3> 1. Have a vision of success</h3><p> <br/> The process of building a great, sustainable practice starts with having a clear vision of what you, as the founder and leader of your practice, want it to look and feel like at some point down the road. Your vision statement should be an overriding description of what you are trying to accomplish; an expression of &lsquo;what you want to be when you grow up&rsquo;.</p><p> To be truly effective, your vision statement should answer such questions as:</p><li> How big do I want my business to become?</li><li> What role am I personally going to play?</li><li> Why should people want to do business with me?</li><li> What type of clients would I like to have?</li><li> What will my support team look like?</li><li> What&rsquo;s our service promise?</li><li> What will it look and feel like when people walk into our office?</li><li> What image will we enjoy in our community and among other professional advisers? <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Create a written strategy to realise your vision</h3><p> <br/> Top-performing advisers always have written plans that they review regularly and use to guide them in their decision making. Drafting an effective strategic plan doesn&rsquo;t have to mean creating an 80-page document. However, they must provide enough information to guide the adviser in managing the business with clear purpose and sharp focus.</p><p> The process for creating a strategic plan should be very familiar to advisers because it is likely the same one they use with clients to create their financial plan. Mr Hartman uses one called &lsquo;Think, See, Draw and Act&rsquo;:</p><li> Think about what you want to accomplish</li><li> See where you are today</li><li> Draw a map to take you from where you are now to where you want to be</li><li> Act to implement <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Understand the metrics of your business</h3><p> <br/> The metrics of your business are things like the size of sale and ration of cases that are in progress as compared with in-force. Top-performing advisers have a keen awareness of what they can expect if they spend time or money on various activities in their business.</p><li> There are only a few levers on which you can push or pull to change the momentum of the business:</li><li> Number of clients and the best ways to attract more</li><li> Average account size</li><li> Share of wallet &ndash; are your clients utilising all your services/product solutions?</li><li> Client retention &ndash; what do clients value and how can you meet or exceed their expectations? <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Know your target market</h3><p> <br/> Top-performing advisers have a clear picture of the people with whom they want to do business. They can define their preferred client profile by such things as age, income, occupation and marital status. They have also identified psychographic characteristics, such as willingness to take advice, ability to make decisions, risk tolerance, beliefs, biases, options and likability.</p><p> Knowing their target market enables advisers to build their knowledge, identify client issues more quickly, and make recommendations more easily. It also provides a greater opportunity to differentiate their practices by demonstrating specific subject matter expertise for people who fit their preferred client profile. As a result, they get more referrals, enabling them to reduce their marketing costs.</p><h3> 5. Have a compelling value proposition</h3><p> <br/> Top-performing advisers give people a compelling reason to want to do business with them, through an articulate and powerful description of their value proposition. In simple terms, your value proposition should tell people what you do, who should be interested in what you do, how you go about it, and why it would be of value to the audience.</p><li> To be truly effective, your value proposition must:</li><li> Inspire people to want to do business with you</li><li> Be deliverable, given your capabilities and resources</li><li> Differentiate you from competitors</li><li> Focus on personal and emotional benefits that the clients will enjoy <br/>  </li><p> Top-performing advisers give people a compelling reason to want to do business with them</p><h3> 6. Effectively manage your pipeline</h3><p> <br/> Top-performing advisers are extremely good at managing the flow of prospects through their business development pipeline. Most important, because they understand the metrics of their business, top-performing advisers can predict the conversion rate of prospective clients with reasonable accuracy, which allows them to control the momentum of their business.</p><p> Rather than adopting a traditional &lsquo;funnel&rsquo; approach, whereby putting more people into the funnel results in a sufficient number coming out at the bottom, top-performing advisers use a &lsquo;pipeline&rsquo; approach. The pipeline approach says that the only people who go into the sales process are the ones that the adviser wants as clients. Your objective in pipeline management is to move prospective clients along a continuum that steadily increases trust, confidence and rapport.</p><p> Top-performing advisers know the best opportunity to grow their business is likely through internal marketing to people who already know and trust them &ndash; their clients. That&rsquo;s why they always have some current clients in the pipeline, knowing that their needs change, their ability to access additional products improves, or new information warrants a review of their current program.</p><h3> 7. Standardised processes &ndash; customised solutions</h3><p> <br/> The business of providing financial advice cannot be rendered into an assembly line-like process; there are too many variables in people&rsquo;s lives, too many emotional differences, and too many products and services to follow exactly the same procedure every time. However, this does not stop top-performing advisers from using standardised processes for efficiency gains.</p><p> Standardised processes may include generating the same documentation for every client, using CRM technology to welcome every new client to the practice, having a systemised approach for booking client meetings, etc. The value is in the consistency and efficiency of the process and its ability to gradually deepen and strengthen the client-adviser relationship, which enables customisable recommendations.</p><h3> 8. Integrate marketing, sales and service</h3><p> <br/> Effective marketing leads to sales. Sales result in a service commitment. Service delivery provides marketing opportunities, and the cycle starts over. Top-performing advisers ensure there is alignment in the message that their marketing conveys, the value proposition they offer, and the service delivered.</p><p> The lifetime value of a client far exceeds the initial compensation.</p><h3> 9. Make every relationship profitable</h3><p> <br/> Many advisers would argue that they have profitable businesses, but this may be because the larger clients are subsidising the costs of smaller clients. Top-performing advisers segment their client base so they can align the level of service they provide with the value of a client to their business. Lower-value clients are serviced in the most cost-effective way, such as through technology or other team members.</p><h3> 10. Create clients for life</h3><p> <br/> The final thing that top-performing advisers do well is to recognise that the lifetime value of a client far exceeds the initial compensation.</p><p> The lifetime value of a client is:</p><li> All revenue generated from products or services you provide to them</li><li> All revenue generated from new clients as a result of introductions from your current clients</li><li> All revenue generated from new clients as a result of introductions from your new clients <br/>  </li><p> <u>  Fred Dodds </u>  is the CEO of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ifa.org.nz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Institute of Financial Advisers  </a> </u> , the professional association for financial planning practitioners in New Zealand, and a highly respected and popular industry veteran who has worked with financial advisers for over 3 decades.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-03 22:32:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-03 22:32:23.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_mDReKr3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-10-things-top-performing-advisers-do-better/\", \"post_id\": \"8349\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-03 22:32:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-03 22:32:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-10-things-top-performing-advisers-do-better\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8348\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3931\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-10-Things-Top-Performing-Advisers-Do-Better_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"627\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451970000,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

He is savvy, and by using emotional intelligence, he can anticipate where the threat will come from so he can keep his eye on the ultimate goal. It&rsquo;s a formula that leads to success.</h3><p> <br/> As entrepreneurs and business owners, you also need to keep focused on your goal instead of being distracted by threats coming from both competitors and a shaky economy.</p><p> <strong>  If only I could predict people&rsquo;s behavior like a spymaster, you tell yourself, I could accomplish great things, too. </strong></p><p> But let me share a secret: there&rsquo;s a little James Bond in all of us. All you need is enough emotional intelligence to observe the people around you. Watch closely enough and they will give you all the clues you need to uncover loyalty, honesty, and deception.</p><p> As an FBI counterintelligence Agent, the first thing I did was put the targets of my investigations under surveillance.</p><p> It wasn&rsquo;t just about being snoopy; instead, I wanted to identify their patterns of behavior.</p><p> Humans have always looked for patterns. From navigating by the stars, planting crops by season, or decoding genetics&mdash;we have a desire to understand, and therefore, predict the future.</p><p> <strong>  Emotional intelligence is being able to identify and understand the behavioral patterns of people around you. Once you do, you know about what motivates them, and the more you know about what motivates them, the better you can predict their choices. </strong></p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t take training at the FBI Academy to learn how to use emotional intelligence to observe behavior and identify patterns. You can learn to do this on your own. Once you do, you will also be able to more accurately predict behavior&mdash;even your own.</p><p> Once you recognize your own patterns of behavior, it will help you recognize them in others.</p><p> Here are three tricks of the trade to develop emotional intelligence:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Use Emotional Intelligence To Notice Spontaneous Remarks </strong></h3><p> <br/> Gut reactions are always close to home. Top-of-the-head responses reveal the location of strong mental connections.</p><p> Unexpected, or even stressful, situations often reveal dominant traits. Use emotional intelligence to properly observe and understand these personality traits. They can explain a lot about the behavior of the other person.</p><p> Daily life provides hundreds of opportunities to observe how people respond to little doses of stress.</p><p> When it comes to learning the tricks of surveillance, start with yourself&mdash;It will make it easier to notice what to look for in others. Let&rsquo;s use the following scenario:</p><p> You have a busy day&mdash;schedule is full, wrapping up projects before 3-day weekend. An employee with a project on deadline calls in sick, what is your first reaction?</p><p> How are they doing&mdash;you are empathic and concerned</p><p> How will the job get done&mdash;you are goal oriented</p><p> Who is going to fill-in&mdash;you are organized and structured</p><p> Are they looking to make this a 4-day weekend&mdash;you are naturally wary and suspicious</p><p> Not worried because it will all work out&mdash;you are an optimist who looks for the best in situations</p><p> Why didn&rsquo;t I know about this sooner&mdash;you have a need for control</p><p> Once you have the emotional intelligence to notice these gut reactions in yourself, it will be easier to notice how someone on your team or a business partner reacts when confronted with a similar situation. If they don&rsquo;t tell you, ASK!</p><h3> <strong>  2. Use Emotional Intelligence To Understand What You Noticed </strong></h3><p> <br/> Taking the time to think clearly after an event has triggered a response is critical. This provides an opportunity to notice feelings and use them as a reminder of how people respond in different situations.</p><p> Again, start with yourself:</p><p> Always pay attention&mdash;make a habit of paying attention to what surprises you, what makes you feel anxious, and what makes you feel good about yourself.</p><p> Never cease collecting information&mdash;where do you not want to listen, where do you insist on taking the opposite point of view, when is your reaction out of proportion?</p><p> There is always more to learn, about ourselves and others.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Use Emotional Intelligence To Stop Undesirable Patterns In Their Tracks </strong></h3><p> <br/> People are creatures of habit. We repeat our patterns of behavior without thinking about them. The most effective way to use emotional intelligence to become aware of these patterns is by looking back at undesirable responses from your business partner, associates, and others in a variety of stressful events and situations.</p><p> With a little experience, you will be able to identify particular instances when people displayed undesirable reactions such as exaggerated drama, panic, anxiety, or anger.</p><p> Deliberately step back from your on-going activities and take some time to think about them. In the process, ask yourself these questions:</p><p> Were you surprised by their reaction?</p><p> Do they always react the same way in certain situations?</p><p> How could you have made it a better experience for them?</p><p> What would you do differently next time?</p><p> As you continue to practice noticing their responses in various situations, you can begin to pull out the threads of their behavior pattern.</p><p> As entrepreneurs and business owners, we can use emotional intelligence to stop negative reactions in both ourselves and others while at the same time encouraging the positive and productive ones.</p><p> When you can read other people, it helps you navigate the unknown so you can land on your feet while never taking your eye off your ultimate goal</p><p> How have you used emotional intelligence to spot undesirable behavior in others?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 00:16:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 00:16:12.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_gNAKwe6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/use-emotional-intelligence-to-discover-your-inner-james-bond/\", \"post_id\": \"8351\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 00:16:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 00:16:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"use-emotional-intelligence-to-discover-your-inner-james-bond\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8350\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3932\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Use-Emotional-Intelligence-To-Discover-Your-Inner-James-Bond.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1155\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/harvard-digitizing-entire-law-library-2/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451905200,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3797,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Demographics of Digital Marketing","link":"the-demographics-of-digital-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Digital marketing has changed so much, often the best path forward it is best to step back and look at the broad landscape.</h3><p> <br/> To do this, I often look at summary reports from the best in the business. Below I lay out some of the biggest findings from the most recent 2015 report from Razorfish entitled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.razorfish.com/binaries/content/assets/ideas/digitaldopaminereport2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital Dopamine: 2015 Global Digital Marketing Report  </a> </u> &rdquo;. </p><p> According to Razorfish, &ldquo;Ideas that were once dominant now face irrelevance, as new digital developments displace them. This transformation occurs rapidly, and marketers are constantly struggling to keep up. Therefore, in preparation for tomorrow, Razorfish took a deep dive into the qualitative and quantitative data of four international markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Brazil) to examine the ways in which digital technology is shifting traditional brand-consumer relationships. From uncovering global commerce expectations to identifying the effect of digital on our subconscious, this research set out to expose the key trends shaping marketing.&rdquo;</p><p> What did Razorfish find in terms of how digital marketing was used in 2015? Here are a few of their key findings:</p><h3> 1. Generational Chasm: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Mobile dominates the Millennial shopping experience. </strong> A Millennial&rsquo;s smartphone is their key to the world. As mobile payment technology grows, mobile is going to become an even more important part of the overall brand and retail experience. Millennials draw no practical distinction between online and offline.</li><li> <strong>  Millennials&rsquo; constantly connected smartphones mean they no longer see a difference between &ldquo;online&rdquo; and &ldquo;offline.&rdquo; </strong> Technology has become an integral part of their lives, and it is how they interact with and experience brands, even when in traditionally &ldquo;offline&rdquo; environments. They don&rsquo;t use media in silos. Rather, they use all of the tools at their fingertips at any given time, regardless of the device or platform.</li><li> <strong>  Millennials are redefining privacy expectations. </strong> When compared to Gen X, Millennials are more likely to trust brands to protect their privacy&mdash;and less likely to think that mobile targeting is an invasion of privacy. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Plan for the Gen X / Gen Y digital divide. </strong> Millennials lead the pack when it comes to the adoption of technology, outpacing their Gen X counterparts in nearly every digital activity on a daily basis. Gen X-led organizations need to ensure that their brand experiences align with Millennials&rsquo; tech-led lives and that digital isn&rsquo;t simply an afterthought in the brand planning process. Target carefully and with purpose.</p><h3> 2. The Digital Experience Economy: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Consumers are actively avoiding advertising. </strong> Consumers in all four markets (United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, China) report doing anything they can to avoid seeing advertising, and many are utilizing tools like DVRs to help them succeed.</li><li> <strong>  Advertising is most effective when it is part of a value exchange. </strong> Consumers are now aware of how much their attention is worth to marketers, and they expect to be rewarded for it. They look to be compensated with loyalty programs, free content or useful tools that solve problems.</li><li> <strong>  Brazil still has a cultural affinity to traditional advertising. </strong> Interestingly, Brazil remains more receptive to advertising than any of the other markets. Fifty-seven percent of Brazilian consumers endorse TV, radio and print ads as the most influential source of advertising. Therefore, it is important to understand that adding value means different things to different cultures. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Make yourself useful. </strong> Brands need to offer their customers services beyond core products and add some real value to peoples&rsquo; lives, if they are not already. Consumers are more likely to stick with a brand if they feel it makes their lives easier.</p><h3> 3. Seamless Commerce: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Digital is the new storefront. </strong> A good e-commerce site is not just a nice-to-have; it has a major impact on your brand. The numbers speak for themselves: 84% of people in Brazil and 92% of people in China say that a bad brand website negatively impacts their opinion of the brand. Seventy-three percent and 79% of people in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, agree.</li><li> <strong>  Current e-commerce experiences fall short of expectations. </strong> Even with the massive accomplishments made in the evolution of commerce, consumers are still not impressed.  Current e-commerce experiences, return policies and shipping options are falling flat in cultivating satisfied customers.</li><li> <strong>  Consumer journeys are peppered with dead ends. </strong> Although consumers no longer view a distinction between online and offline brand channels, brands are not yet structured to support this outlook. This creates a tension between what consumers want and what brands are providing, forcing consumers to jury-rig solutions. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Empower your customer. </strong> Inflexible returns policies, in particular, are a major point of friction in both the online and offline retail experiences. A good return policy is an easy way to differentiate your brand from the competition, build loyalty and earn trust.</p><h3> 4. Digital Conditioning: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Consumers admit to technology dependence. </strong> Over three-quarters of consumers in all four of the markets surveyed admitted to often feeling dependent on technology. Many elements are cited for the development of this dependence, including utility, connectivity and the positive emotions they associate with it.</li><li> <strong>  We&rsquo;ve been exposed to digital classical conditioning. </strong> As proven by Pavlov, repeatedly pairing two cues can elicit a classically conditioned response. This is equally true for many consumers who use smartphones&mdash;the light or sound emitted from the device triggers a response of immediate attention.</li><li> <strong>  Instant gratification is not always preferred. </strong> Remarkably, consumers in all four markets reported more excitement when receiving a purchase in the mail than when buying in the store. This illuminates an interesting aspect of shopping that is specific to e-commerce&mdash; the power of pleasurable anticipation and delayed gratification. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Use &ldquo;surprises and delights&rdquo; to your advantage. </strong> Without turning brand communications into a carnival of push notifications and flashing buttons, you can still create pleasurable moments of anticipation around routine events for a brand. Smart marketers will play around with game mechanics in the shopping and purchasing process, while ensuring it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of simplicity and service.</p><h3> 5. Emerging Markets in the Fast Lane: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Consumers in Brazil and China are tech-hungry early adopters. </strong> This data shows that Internet users in these markets rely on technology for every part of their lives and continually look for more ways to integrate it.</li><li> <strong>  Consumers in countries with lower Internet penetration may be the most demanding online. </strong> There are unexpectedly high expectations for digital services and websites in countries with lower Internet penetration. In particular, there is a very strong desire in Brazil and China for e-commerce to improve.</li><li> <strong>  Tech savvy spans all generations. </strong> While there is an important digital divide between Millennials and Gen Xers in the United States and United Kingdom, these demographic differences aren&rsquo;t so pronounced in Brazil and China. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Consider Brazil and China as early adopters. </strong> Emerging markets like these are exciting places to test new technology. <strong>  These consumers are not afraid of technology and are actively looking for new ways to use it in their daily lives. </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 00:21:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 00:21:43.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_mMPjvKS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-demographics-of-digital-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"8353\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 00:21:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 00:21:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-demographics-of-digital-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8352\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3933\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Demographics-of-Digital-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1627\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451939400,"author_id":438,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3798,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want to Know What the Other Insurance Marketers Are Doing?","link":"want-to-know-what-the-other-insurance-marketers-are-doing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> \"Insurance Marketing &amp; Distribution Summit Europe 2015\", earlier last month, proved to be a great event.</h3><p> <br/> There were interesting speakers, a range of topics &amp; plenty of opportunity for interaction. Plus, it was a pleasure to share with this group myself, more on that later.</p><p> Following previous reviews, of events that were useful for getting close to leaders on whom insight leaders focus less ( <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/events/working-on-your-marriage-with-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IT  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/events/how-are-you-joining-forces-with-your-digital-leader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/events/moments-of-truth-day-playing-in-legoland/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CX  </a> </u> ), I was back with Marketing &amp; Sales. Probably, the primary customer for most insurance insight teams is their marketing leader. So, I hope it's helpful to hear the thoughts &amp; plans of a number of leaders from Insurance marketing community.</p><p> Here are my memories of key messages from these insurance marketers:</p><h3> <u>  Marco Brandt </u>  (Agila) </h3><p> Shared on their journey from being a broker based Pet insurer to focussing on internet channel. They were clear on their USP, brand identity and consistency of messaging across channels. They also used digital capabilities for personalisation of comms &amp; pricing. Perhaps the biggest opportunity for them though, was to use their digital communication &amp; free content to dramatically increase the number of touch-points with their customers (a recurring theme). They have a strong sorry to tell in growth of customer satisfaction &amp; premium income (doubling in 5 years). Their next, self identified, challenge is to embrace mobile.</p><h3> <u>  Stephan Dequaire </u>  (Towergate) </h3><p> Provided a review of the growth of price comparison sites in UK car insurance industry. I was surprised how much Compare the Market now dominates above even MSM &amp; Go Compare. It was also interesting to see how much this model varies across the world. Even excluding the US, intermediaries (including tied agents) are more the norm across Europe, together with larger share for Bancassurers. Some research suggests the shine is coming off them though, with even consumer advice sites also pointing to direct insurers too. What was more shocking was to hear how a consumer advice site suggests consumers lie about data to get a better price ('optimising your job title' etc). It really brought home the erosion of consumer trust in UK market especially.</p><h3> <u>  Phil Bayles </u>  (Aviva) </h3><p> Then complimented this view by reminding us that across Aviva &amp; insurance as a whole, the intermediary channel still provides largest profit &amp; volume. There was also a nice segway into my later talk by stressing how over 25% of management time was now taken up by Conduct Risk agenda. The challenge with succeeding with your intermediary channel (inc. IFAs) is that they deal with you day in day out. You can't persuade them with some catchy or emotive brand advertising, if the service experience doesn't match. As well as showing us a trophy cabinet of which Aviva is rightly proud, Phil stressed the need for a focus on adviser satisfaction, ease &amp; fixing problems identified quickly. With a declared strategy to be \"No. 1 for Brokers\", there is no where to hide if tracking does not match up. TNPS scores suggest they are well on the way.</p><h3> <u>  Simon Green </u>  (The FCA) </h3><p> Opened a new theme, focussing on regulation. It was interesting to hear their director for all general insurance lines stress how much he welcomed meeting with the insurance marketing community. Familiar themes emerged through Simon's presentation, including focus on embedding in culture, looking for systematic market-wide issues &amp; the continual mantra of the of consistently delivering good outcomes for customers. He also referenced their  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/behavioural-economics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   behavioural economics  </a> </u>  expertise influencing policy &amp; reviews, as well as the important role of technology innovation. On that topic it was good to hear the reference to \"regulatory sandbox\" and encouragement to participate in Project Innovate.</p><h3> <u>  Pollyanna Deane </u>  (Simmons &amp; Simmons) </h3><p> Brought legal expertise to our proceedings and picked up on a number of pieces of pending regulation that Simon had mentioned. Increased regulatory scrutiny was once more a theme with an analysis of the likely impact of Insurance Distribution Directive. She also referenced the changes being made at each stage and the risk of European Insurance &amp; Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) becoming a third regulator for UK insurers!</p><p> I then presented on Customer Insight &amp; Conduct Risk. Sharing a number of the lessons learnt from  <u>  <a href=\"http://laughlinconsultancy.com/news/conduct-risk-training-for-customer-insight-teams/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   training insurance marketing teams  </a> </u>  on using customer insight to mitigate conduct risk. This including briefly covering  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/polls/poll-results-conduct-risk-and-insight-gaps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Consumer Spotlight, Behavioural Economics &amp; Vulnerable Customers  </a> </u> . I'm pleased to say there was considerable interest afterwards as marketing leaders could see the benefits of more focus on conduct &amp; embedding insight in their processes.</p><h3> <u>  Louis de Broglie </u>  (InsPeer) </h3><p> Focused on innovation. He explained the interesting concept on which his start-up, InsPeer is based. Returning to the insurance origins, of mutuality &amp; governance in community, he provides consumers with a way to pool their excesses. Only available in France for now, this unregulated solution combines purchase of high-excess cover from an insurer with a community who contract to cover a proportion of others excess in the event of a claim. This results in lower premium &amp; zero excess for each individual, as well as social pressure on claim veracity and lower claims frequency for the insurer. The next stage is intended to be peer-to-peer insurance, akin to the evolving models from Guevara in the UK and others worldwide. Given the explosive growth of Uber &amp; AirBnb, it seems likely some model of peer-to-peer disruption will take off.</p><h3> <u>  Monika Schulze </u>  (Zurich) </h3><p> Returned us to the theme of greater engagement through marketing. Her recurrent theme was the importance of emotion. Using your brand &amp; an emotionally engaging narrative, consistently across your channels to provoke positive responses &amp; engagement from consumers. Inspired by \"Transmedia Branding\", through a number of impactful videos and examples of clever use of social media, Monika really brought this to life. Perhaps the most surprising one of this event was about Lidl selling milk in Sweden. Through active monitoring of Facebook comments, Lidl spotted that a Swede called Bosse had commented that he didn't want to buy German milk. They used this as a chance to humanise their brand and renamed their milk across Sweden as \"Bosse's Milk\", including a photo of him &amp; explanation that it is Swedish milk. This action in response to an individual captured the public imagination &amp; impacted sales. Some great examples of fleet of foot &amp; creative marketers using emotional advertising (checkout Zurich's #SaveThe Snowmen).</p><h3> Gordon Rutherford (Axa) </h3><p> Also stressed the importance of emotional communication in brand engagement. Together with a warning against being one of those needy brands who are basically using social media to say 'please love me'. He highlighted the impact of finding a noble cause to really make a difference &amp; impact brand sentiment. Domestic have done this well with their free provision to clean festival toilets &amp; sanitation provision in the developing world. An Axa example is their \"glass of consciousness\" exhibitions in Mexico, to engage the public with the need to change attitudes to drink driving. Once again, a way to humanise a brand &amp; engage your own employees with making a social difference.</p><h3> <u>  Edward Rice </u>  (AIG) </h3><p> Shared their progress in digital transformation. Beyond just digital as a marketing channel, to reengineering your business &amp; particularly customers' experiences. As he rightly highlighted these are set not by the current low bar of insurance industry but by the personalised digital ease they experience from other retailers.  Ed shared the useful guide of HBR's \"7 steps to better Customer Experience\". Then he shared numerous examples of how, once you have the basics delivered consistently, you can surprise and delight your customers with personalisation &amp; relevance. On interesting example was marketing by Boden &amp; EasyJet which plays back to customers their journey with your brand, demonstrating remembering their past purchases and an apparent growing understanding. Ed also touched on the power of responding to one individual on social media as a way to humanise your brand &amp; be playful. Plus the space for innovation in helping protect customers, beyond advice &amp; timely warnings, to reducing the likelihood of an event.</p><h3> <u>  Isabelle Conner </u>  (Generali) </h3><p> Explained the huge cultural transformation that she is leading there. Transforming a 184 year old business from product-centric to customer-centric. Putting the customers &amp; distribution at the heart of everything we do, as Generali put it. She again stressed the importance of emotional brand marketing &amp; reminded us all that we are in an ideal position to do this, with insurance being about both protecting what people love &amp; being there when the traumatic happens. But, as Isabelle rightly stressed, that is about changing the customer experience reality &amp; internal brand reality, not just broadcasting a message. Perhaps the most impactful part of this was when she shared with us videos of Generali's CEOs from Spain, Switzerland &amp; France calling customers who left detractor NPS ratings. It is so important to include timely response &amp; resolution in your NPS metric programmes, but even more impactful for your culture once you engage CEOs down in the experience.</p><h3> Stephen Ingledew (Standard Life)</h3><p> Although not an insurer, shares many of our challenges in the world of retirement savings,investment &amp; income solutions. Building on the principles others had shared previously, Stephen added the importance of customer engagement in redesigning improved experiences. He shared some details of co-creation sessions and agile development. The latter being not just an approach to IT development but also a mindset of continual learning &amp; iteration. Some of his example online tools also included elements of gamification, which is helpful for consumers in the baffling world of 'pension reform' choices. The brand approach of #ReadyWhenUAre nicely balances a range of enablers with avoiding being paternalistic. Another critical customer need in this area is education, but how to do it in a way that is neither boring nor patronising? The selection of Steph &amp; Dom from Gogglebox to host a series of videos to chat in the pub about the issues was inspired &amp; one can see what it has gone viral.</p><h3> <u>  Zach Goren </u>  (Media Alpha) </h3><p> Brought the world of west coast US innovation to our conference. His business is helping UA auto insurers, amongst others, to buy targeted 'in market' customer leads in real time rather than relying on mass market advertising through Google (where insurance keywords cost a fortune). It is basically an innovation on the traditional market of selling unconverted quotes, but doing this in real time and staying on the insurers site. So, the insurer becomes both a seller themselves &amp; a seller of advertising space to competitors, especially where customer details show this person is unlikely to convert. Real opportunities for offering more choice to consumer &amp; repositioning the proposition.</p><h3> <u>  James Baker </u>  (Vitality) </h3><p> Leads Insight there and helps their brand understand how to bring about behavioural change in their customers. They have an interesting proposition, which is health insurance plus helping motivate you to not need it, through rewards for a healthier lifestyle. This gives more opportunity for engagement with insurance customers &amp; tangible value back on your policy (many insurers would love to achieve either). Their insight, built on a  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/segmentation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hybrid segmentation  </a> </u>  of FSS &amp; behavioural analytics, has identified 2 barriers they need to help customers overcome w.r.t. 'wellness': (i) low interest category; (ii) low engagement with action. A number of actions &amp; rewards, under the concepts of \"we'll be there for you\" and \"we'll make it more rewarding to be well in the first place\", have driven significant engagement &amp; behaviour change. Ideally placed to exploit wearables &amp; other IoT innovation, given the importance of employers &amp; employee benefit consultants to their business, they can also demonstrate benefits in reduced absenteeism.</p><h3> <u>  David Stevens </u>  (LV=) </h3><p> Brought to life the complex world of automated advice in the pensions/retirement income sector. They have innovated with so called 'robo-advice' (although their process also includes a human interaction before executing).Their innovation with Wealth Wizards (whom they acquired) and breaking down the steps into manageable chunks should really help more customers face doing this. With the high cost of advice, too many of the public are not engaging with such an intangible service. A fixed price of &pound;199 to get personalised options after an automated fact find is much more accessible &amp; communicated in an emotionally warm &amp; less threatening way. Once again you can see the influences of both personalisation &amp; gamification in their communication. The style of comms &amp; ease of playing with the tools also contribute to humanising insurance (as does clear fixed pricing).</p><h3> <u>  Adam Kornick </u>  (Aviva) </h3><p> Heads up their global  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/tips-maximising-analytics-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   analytics capability  </a> </u>  &amp; shared how they are using predictive analytics in pricing &amp; risk modelling. An important reminder that price is the primary selection criteria consumers cite with insurance, so personalised pricing matters every bit as much, if not more than personalised comms. One of their key innovations has been to build on the individual price for quoting (based on captured &amp; average data) that others have done for Home insurance and extend it across their range plus combine with Next Best action. This enables them to put in front of customers, the price for a product which they are most likely to buy next (when also considering price competitiveness). It was also interesting to hear of their progress in broker analytics, another reminder as to the importance of the intermediary channel &amp; how predictive analytics can help their too.</p><p> Phew, well done for making it to the end of this post! As, I've highlighted in colour above, key themes I took away are: personalisation; emotions; humanising insurance; more frequent engagement through communication; innovations; the continued importance of intermediary channel.</p><p> Hope all those topics &amp; ideas were useful. Please do share the insurance marketers' innovations, you are managing to inspire, from customer insight. </p><p> Meanwhile, if you're interested to know more, you can download a free copy of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/PaulLaughlin/customer-insight-conduct-risk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my presentation here  </a> </u> . </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 00:34:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 00:34:45.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_x0K6ygC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-to-know-what-the-other-insurance-marketers-are-doing/\", \"post_id\": \"8354\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 00:34:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 00:34:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-to-know-what-the-other-insurance-marketers-are-doing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8352\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3934\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Demographics-of-Digital-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"765\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451938500,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3800,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Top 10 Things You Can Plan to Experience at Your Next Event","link":"top-10-things-you-can-plan-to-experience-at-your-next-event","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corpmagic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jeff Kirk  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://corporatemagicinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Corporate Magic  </u> </a></p><p> Although every event is different and every business has a unique way of presenting, there are always some things that are easily predictable when it comes to meetings and events. The reason for this is because of the advances in technology, experiences, and interactivity. Event and meeting attendees expect to be engaged in more ways than one, with an experience that they will remember for a long time. The following are ten trends that you can plan to see at upcoming events.</p><h3> Big-Budgets</h3><p> <br/> Short-term money savings does not mean long-term business. In fact, it&rsquo;s quite the opposite. When businesses and event managers cut back on funds, excitement, memories, and positive outcomes are unfortunately cut back on as well. Bigger budgets are making a comeback, and for good reason! With big budgets comes the latest in technology. With the latest in technology comes curious onlookers. With curious onlookers comes potential clients and future attendees.</p><h3> Corporate Social Responsibility</h3><p> <br/> No matter where an event takes place, there is always something that needs to be done within the community. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) not only gives the business a good reputation, but allows the community to benefit as well. Additionally, it creates a sense of community among event attendees and employees.</p><h3> Engaged Senses</h3><p> <br/> The five senses of the human body are some amazing attributes. Event planners can capitalize on something natural and exciting to create further excitement in attendees. Not only do attendees get to experience something enjoyable and pleasant, but they are interacting and taking time to really engage in conversation and activities at the booth. Examples may include scratch-and-sniff postcards, samples of different textured products, and even a taster&rsquo;s table.</p><h3> Food and Drinks</h3><p> <br/> Speaking of tasting something delightful, you are bound to find a booth at your next event that caters specifically to the sense of taste. Food and drinks are returning to the event scene. Wine and cheese may complement your business, while a small cocktail bar may complement another. Everyone wants a snack or a drink while at a busy event, and a business that capitalizes on that is one that is making a smart move.</p><h3> Holographics</h3><p> <br/> In the past, live bands and entertainment took up space and filled the event venue with amazing music. You won&rsquo;t see a lack in entertainment or music at your next event, but you may find a lack of a physical presence. Using holographics, a business can hold a live concert at their booth, without having to bring in all the equipment necessary to succeed. To make it interactive, a karaoke experience may even be set up.</p><h3> Local Flavor</h3><p> <br/> Local. Everyone wants local. Everyone wants to support locally. Food trucks that come from actual local vendors are sure to pop up at your next event. They will offer event goers some amazing meal options, as well as bring a sense of community to the event. With various styles of foods, attendees will not have to wonder what they&rsquo;re eating at their next meal. In fact, this could be some great advertising for the city in which the event is held.</p><h3> Memorable Activities</h3><p> <br/> Event planners cannot forget to plan activities for a little downtime. In order to ensure a unique and memorable experience, attendees should have something to do when they arrive, sometime during the event, and perhaps even right before they head home. One example is of an event planner that had Navy SEAL trainers actually train the attendees at the event. They experienced something at that event that they will remember forever. With that memory, they will remember the entire event.</p><h3> Outdoor Events</h3><p> <br/> Although a hotel or large indoor arena is often the typical venue to hold an event, more and more event planners are turning to the outdoors. Sporting venues, public beaches, and even blocked roads are the perfect places to hold such an event. When the weather is good, you might as well use it to your advantage so that attendees will feel more like they are on a vacation than at a business conference.</p><h3> Popular Culture</h3><p> <br/> With all the fun and interesting ideas surrounding event planning, it is important to stay enlightened about popular culture. Social media is perhaps at the top of the list, making it essential that event planners implement it. The next event you attend may have employees specifically assigned to take pictures and post to Instagram. They may be primarily responsible to post to Facebook or Twitter. By using hashtags and links, attendees and potential customers can stay in touch.</p><h3> Storylines</h3><p> <br/> A theme just won&rsquo;t work at an event these days. Themes are too boring and not involved enough. Event planners instead, will tell a story. They will have an entire storyline that gives meaning and purpose to the event, the attendees, and the vendors. The storyline will show where everyone can benefit, and will entertain everyone in the meantime.</p><p> A corporate event is an incredible way to get your message across. The next time you head to an event, look for these ten trends and realize that the event planners are trying to take your experience up a notch with each trend.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 00:59:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 00:59:11.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_oYkR5yy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/top-10-things-you-can-plan-to-experience-at-your-next-event/\", \"post_id\": \"8358\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 00:59:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 00:59:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"top-10-things-you-can-plan-to-experience-at-your-next-event\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8357\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3936\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Top-10-Things-You-Can-Plan-to-Experience-at-Your-Next-Event.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"419\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451934000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3801,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Know the Probable Reason Why Marketing is Dead?","link":"know-the-probable-reason-why-marketing-is-dead","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sssiddhanta\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Soumen Siddhanta  </a> </u>  |  <u>  soumensiddhanta.com </u></p><p> Standard marketing made use of to be the silver bullet for enhancing sales and getting more consumers. It might prompt commitment in existing customers and coax brand-new potential customers into attempting your product and services. This is no more the case. Individuals have actually been pounded with marketing messages, advertising campaign, and sales pitches for years. Individuals have actually grown familiar with having every minute in their day swamped with unsolicited, undesirable messages.</p><p> As a society we have actually grown calloused to their efforts. We are compelled to see advertisements prior to we see videos, erase spam from our in-boxes, and scroll past them to check out the material we want. The common person considers them an annoyance at finest. At worst it&rsquo;s an infraction of our individual area and an insult to our intelligence.</p><p> We can never ever stop &lsquo;marketing&rsquo; to individuals, however if we can see it in another light we might have the ability to alter the method individuals respond to it and engage with our business. Here are 3 factors we have to start thinking about marketing as serving our customers instead of offering to them:</p><h3> 1.  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/08/marketing-is-dead\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Captive Audiences No more Exist </a></h3><p> <br/> The days of the captive audience vanished with the development of TiVo. As quickly as individuals recognized they didn&rsquo;t need to enjoy commercials they began to end up being hyper-aware of the advertisements they were having actually thrust upon them. As a society this end up being a release from the shackles we had actually been accustomed to for so long.</p><p> You are most likely questioning concerns like: exactly what about advertisements in places like sporting occasions or cinema? Well, individuals are pulling out of those too, mainly by looking at their phones. If it&rsquo;s not appropriate to their life, they are not going to let you attack their mental area.</p><p> Significance is the very best method to really reach your perfect audience. By targeting individuals who would benefit most from your offerings you can narrow the field where you play. When you have condensed your audience you have to show to them you deserve their interest.</p><p> Offer them something. Not a voucher or seudo &lsquo;advantage&rsquo;. Really provide them something helpful! Do not fret about handing out the farm absolutely free, be more worried about helping them. Serve your possible customers. A real mindset of service will win the hearts and interest of individuals you wish to reach.</p><h3> 2. Competitors for Individuals&rsquo;s Interest is Intense</h3><p> <br/> Everybody is clawing for the interest and commitment of brand-new clients. If you utilize a standard marketing project you will simply be pressed to the side with every other marketing method. You will be neglected! This is a nail in the casket. Once individuals get the sensation that you are aiming to offer to them, they shut you out. &lsquo;In your face&rsquo; advertising and marketing strategies will trigger you to lose more customers than you will acquire.</p><p> How do you stick out from the remainder of the marketing projects? Once again, the response depends on serving the people that require your services or products. If you can supply real assistance to individuals that require it (read: Serve them) you will not just cultivate consumers that are more devoted you will have others seeking your aid.</p><p> Sure, you might get burned a couple of times in the procedure. There will constantly be individuals aiming to benefit from a totally free assessment or trial, however being real in your desire to assist will enhance your opportunities of in fact reaching your audience.</p><h3> 3. Individuals are Protective of Their Time and Impacts</h3><p> <br/> The digital age has actually enabled individuals to end up being smarter with regards to the method they accept impacts in their lives. They are really mindful of where they put their commitment and standoff-ish with regards to dedication. Nobody wishes to invest their time and psychological energy into any business that simply desires their patronage. Not just are individuals protective of themselves, they are really protective of how they affect those in their network. There is a worry that we will be lumped in with individuals that forward chain e-mails and alienate their good friends.</p><p> You are most likely questioning the best ways to conquer this. Be real. If you desire individuals&rsquo;s commitment you need to make it, not ask for it. Serve somebody so well that they are obliged to share it with their network. Never ever ask somebody to offer or promote your offerings. If they are assisted enough, they will wish to preach your advantages to the world!</p><p> Individuals fast to publish bad evaluations, however it takes a really unique experience for somebody to promote a services or product to their pals.

{"original_id":3802,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Was 2015 The Year of \"Peak ETF\" or The Tip of the ETF Iceberg?","link":"was-2015-the-year-of-peak-etf-or-the-tip-of-the-etf-iceberg","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Each January, the professional community that creates, trades, markets, researches and promotes ETFs gathers at the Inside ETFs Conference in South Florida.  Hosted by research firm ETF.com, Inside ETFs has long reflected the strength of the industry and the tone and size of the event has generally portended what the year will shape up like for the fastest growing segment of the investment product landscape.  And, for the last half dozen years, the <strong>  \"this year it's bigger and more buzzy than ever\" </strong> hype seems to match up appropriately with the direction of the industry.  <strong>  2015 saw approximately 270 new ETFs debut, with new entries from the industry behemoths like iShares, Vanguard and State Street as well as hard charging players like WisdomTree and upstarts like PureFunds. </strong></p><p> <strong>  The total new products launched in 2015 increased ETF product totals in the U.S. by roughly 16%. </strong>  Total dollars invested domestically in ETFs have soared to $3 trillion across 1550 ETP.  At the same time, we saw some unsettling glitches in the system - most notably, what happened on August 24th when at least 85 different ETFs saw trading in their shares halted at least five times. (Barron's explains the episode well here:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.barrons.com/articles/the-great-etf-debacle-explained-1441434195\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.barrons.com/articles/the-great-etf-debacle-explained-1441434195  </a> </u> ) The incident spurred many to ask \"Are ETFs really ready to handle a big market correction and will individual investors get hurt more investing in them than they would if they remained in traditional mutual funds?\"</p><p> ETF product issuers are quick to point to the issue being a market structure issue.  Others say that the rules put in place after the 2010 flash crash had the unintended consequence of triggering the August mayhem.  The debate will last for some time, but I'll draw your attention to a larger question: Was 2015 the year we witnessed Peak ETF? Will it be akin to what 2001 was for mutual funds?</p><p> Make no mistake, the August 24th issues did slow the momentum 0f the exchange-traded product industry.   Individual investors, typically sheltered from the \"how the sausage is made\" discussions related to funds, were made aware of the hiccups by several days and weeks of coverage of the event.  And, some issuers reported intentional delaying of new product launches in late 2015 as a result of poor liquidity for ETFs in the markets - a likely hangover effect from August.  At the same time, the markets seem to be creeping toward a precipice where mainstream bonds and domestic equities are all likely to face a comeuppance in 2016. Hardly great conditions for continued asset gathering if lingering doubt over the structure of ETFs combines forces with an epic market meltdown.</p><p> Mutual funds, the apparent loser in the ETF vs. mutual funds tug-of-war, had a similar year in 2001.  Stock markets had peaked in 2000, inspiring opportunistic mutual fund firms to launch new funds and 2001 - while relatively sideways for the U.S. markets - saw total mutual funds reach its peak level.   When the markets hit bottom in 2002, mutual funds began closing up shop.  And, even though the categories of funds and dissection of asset classes has only proliferated in the subsequent 13 years, mutual funds have not recaptured the peak total set in 2001.   Like ETFs facing the August 24th episode, mutual funds were thrown for a loop by a spate of accounting scandals that forced companies to restate earnings and the demise of the tech bubble.  The confluence of events stifled momentum for mutual funds that has never been fully recaptured.</p><p> There is a chance, although I'll say it is a small one, that 2015 indeed was the year of peak ETF. New product issuance is bound to slow down, at least as measured on a percentage basis, and some investors will be skittish.  The next market depression will create an inaugural batch of investors who lost all their money in ETFs (even if the investment vehicle is only incidental to the experience).    The more likely outcome for the ETF community is the the market structure built up to support ETFs will continue to mature and account for potential glitches. Regulators will create rules that speak to the most recent issues and growth will continue.</p><p> For marketers and communications professionals like me, our job will only become more challenging as the sophistication of the products increases and the market issues demand greater ability to distill the complex into simpler terms. The ETF community has only begun to capture the attention of the individual investor and can't afford to lose that trust with a failure to account for the nuances of communication. </p><p> At Gregory FCA, we work extensively with ETF issuers and other players in the ETF arena on their communications, PR and marketing efforts.  We're ready for what 2016 will bring us. Are you?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 20:18:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 20:18:31.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_iEp9fyI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/was-2015-the-year-of-peak-etf-or-the-tip-of-the-etf-iceberg/\", \"post_id\": \"8362\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 20:18:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 20:18:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"was-2015-the-year-of-peak-etf-or-the-tip-of-the-etf-iceberg\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8360\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3940\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Does-Independence-Make-Good-Economic-Sense-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"352\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451989800,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor and the phrase &ldquo;two left feet&rdquo; came into being to describe me as did the term &ldquo;wallflower&rdquo; during my teen years. However, in my fourth decade I got hooked on ballroom dancing and never considered stopping until I broke my foot 15 years later. Another story.</p><p> In the beginning as a non-dancer, I lacked awareness not just about how to dance, but about my physical presence.  Having never been into sports, ever, and finding every excuse not to be, I tried various programs because it was &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; to do to stay healthy and fit.</p><p> Having tried yoga, jazzersize, stretching, bought a stationery bike, a treadmill, and weight lifting, and didn&rsquo;t stick with any of them for very long. Then I discovered ballroom dancing and became totally addicted to it.   </p><p> I lucked out with an excellent teacher who expected excellence from his students.  One of the first things Jerry taught me was when his hand extended to invite me to dance, was to pay attention to how I was approaching him. I was like a bulldozer bumping into his chest and almost knocking him over rather than gracefully inserting myself into his appropriately positioned arms.  </p><p> He told me that a lot of women do this unwittingly and by pointing it out he was choosing to protect himself from the impact.  Until that lesson, I clearly didn&rsquo;t have a moment&rsquo;s thought about how my movement was affecting him.  </p><p> So here&rsquo;s the lesson for business and life in general.  Do you pay attention or think about how your behavior, your presence, your demeanor affects the other person?</p><p> Do you pay attention to how others react to you? How is your handshake? Do you focus on talking about  yourself? Could you be seen as overbearing or are you hardly noticed? Do you push a business card in someone&rsquo;s hand without asking if they want it? Do you stand too close, too far? Do you ask about them and show interest when they tell you? Is the tone of your voice too loud, too low? Do you interrupt? Do you listen well without thinking about making the sale? Do you care about the person?  Do you know how to show it?</p><p> As a coach that specializes in relationships in business, I sometimes see in the marketing material or websites of some businesses that the focus is on themselves and not on the people they would like to serve.  </p><p> On the other hand, there are websites that don&rsquo;t even mention the name of the owner, let alone something about who they are, their values or mission in offering their product or service.  All of this makes an unspoken impression and not necessarily the one you want.</p><p> There are so many times each day when our presence affects someone else. Become aware of them by noticing examples as you go through your day. Check to see if you gracefully insert yourself or are you a bulldozer.  Bonus: if you apply this in your personal life, your relationships will improve.</p><p> By the way, I had reached gold level in some dances before I broke my foot. So those early years of my not believing that I could be a dancer was very wrong. That&rsquo;s another story. </p><p> I love to receive your comments and questions, but please don&rsquo;t call me when Dancing With The Stars is on TV!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 20:28:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 20:28:44.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_6bpxzi3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-a-ballroom-dance-lesson-can-grow-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"8364\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 20:28:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 20:28:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-a-ballroom-dance-lesson-can-grow-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8363\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3941\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-A-Ballroom-Dance-Lesson-Can-Grow-Your-Business-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"925\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452006000,"author_id":151,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3804,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are These Biases Killing Your Decisions?","link":"are-these-biases-killing-your-decisions","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Over the weekend, I followed through on one of (if not) the greatest decisions I&rsquo;ve ever made. I married my best friend and the person who has positively impacted my life in countless ways.</p><p> In general, I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;make much&rdquo; of any decision I make. I take in the information I need, process it quickly, and then decide. I rarely sweat the consequences because I&rsquo;ve learned that everything usually turns out well in the end. If it hasn&rsquo;t turned out well, then it just hasn&rsquo;t ended yet.</p><p> That philosophy can be applied to many decisions you make, although I do recommend more rigor when applying it to whom and when you should marry. I hope you get my gist for illustrative purposes.</p><p> Leading up to my wedding, I started thinking about decisions people make in their lives, the logic they use, and all the other influences that make it difficult to choose wisely. When I start thinking, it usually means a blog post will follow.</p><p> I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to highlight some interference we all deal with daily thanks to our historical paths and perceptions of what we consider &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;</p><h3> Confirmation Bias <br/>  </h3><p> Do you seek friends, newspapers, television shows and other external sources that always agree with you? Do you seek information until you find something that tells you what you want to hear? Every-day-humans like you and I do this often. Sadly, scientists and doctors do it too.</p><p> <strong>  Your fix: </strong> Seek alternate viewpoints. If you can&rsquo;t find them, look at whatever you&rsquo;re considering and simply think the opposite. Keep investigating and reviewing it until it possibly has merit.</p><h3> Monte Carlo Bias <br/>  </h3><p> This one is known by many names including the Gambler&rsquo;s Fallacy, Maturity of Chances Fallacy, or the Logical Fallacy. Why do you think the quarter is more likely to rest on tails if the four previous times showed heads? I don&rsquo;t know either. It&rsquo;s always 50%/50%. Always. History has no correlation.</p><p> <strong>  Your fix: </strong> Don&rsquo;t think of outcomes in terms of groups. You thought tails because you looked at five flips as a group. Think in terms of individual situations. Every flip is one isolated toss. If I considered my marriage to be part of all marriages in the universe with its lofty divorce rate of over 50%, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten married. I considered my marriage one of one. Silly analogy, but true.</p><h3> Status-Quo Bias <br/>  </h3><p> Do you wonder why things don&rsquo;t change much in your life? If that&rsquo;s the case, you likely have a strong preference for your current situation. More importantly, however, is that your view of change is typically negative in relation to your current situation. You also think that any change is a loss of what you currently have instead of a change for the better. I see this often with people who are changing jobs. Even though they might be moving toward a better situation, they still are heavily focused on what they&rsquo;re losing.</p><p> <strong>  Your fix: </strong> Look forward. Last time I checked life doesn&rsquo;t move in reverse&mdash;no matter how many wrinkle lines you want to remove.</p><h3> Endowment Effect <br/>  </h3><p> This is one of my favorites and anyone who has attempted to trade in a vehicle or sell it via the classifieds will get a chuckle. Why do you consider anything you already own more valuable than anyone else would consider it? Do you have sentimental attachments to items in your home? Did you build the fence that encloses your beautiful backyard? You will value these things more because you have memories, love of labor, and a host of other expensive emotions that increase the value to you.</p><p> <strong>  Your fix: </strong> This one is a bit tough, but you need to remove your emotional attachment or rechannel it. First, ask yourself, &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t already own this, what would I be willing to pay?&rdquo; Second, think in terms of the future enjoyment others will have whenever you sell or give something away. This requires some selflessness, but most people are good-hearted and this surprisingly works well.</p><h3> Negativity Bias <br/>  </h3><p> Have you ever watched the news? Why do people pay more attention to negative or bad news than they will good news? Bad news is easier to believe than good news. People are generally suspicious. They also think that bad news is more important. Sad. But true.</p><p> <strong>  Your fix: </strong> Turn off the television for one week. Don&rsquo;t read a newspaper. And, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t click on any negative articles you see on your Facebook or Twitter feeds. Call me in a week and tell me how you feel.</p><h3> Sunk Cost Bias <br/>  </h3><p> Are you unable to leave a theatre twenty minutes into a movie you already hate? Do you need to finish that book you don&rsquo;t like simply because you started it? Have you ever kept wearing a piece of clothing you didn&rsquo;t like because you paid $100 for it? Congratulations, you&rsquo;ve been infected by the sunk cost bias. The debt has been paid and you&rsquo;ll never get it back. The only thing worse that paying $15 for a movie you don&rsquo;t like is spending another one hundred minutes of your life watching it.</p><p> <strong>  Your fix: </strong> Recognize that every moment in your life you have a choice. Ask yourself this question, &ldquo;Knowing what I know now, do I want to continue?&rdquo; Remember, when you bought the tickets for the show, you didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. Every minute of your life, you have more information that you had the minute before. Use it.</p><p> As always, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you: <strong>  What are your toughest biases to overcome? </strong></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 20:38:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 20:38:15.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_A02RYlc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-these-biases-killing-your-decisions/\", \"post_id\": \"8365\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 20:38:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 20:38:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-these-biases-killing-your-decisions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8363\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3942\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-A-Ballroom-Dance-Lesson-Can-Grow-Your-Business-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"352\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452000600,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

When you bring a small group of people together, from a variety of backgrounds, industries, and experience-levels, everyone looks at the world through a different filter, and they all add something unique to the conversation.  And, without a doubt, we&rsquo;re all richer for it.</p><p> Of course it&rsquo;s all generalities, but I&rsquo;ve observed that each group tends to bring different strengths to the space.  The corporate leaders often understand strategy, but sometimes struggle with purpose and can be hesitant to show their true selves and take bold action.  The non-profit leaders in the room have no problem with purpose, but strategy can be a mystery, and because they&rsquo;re wearing a million hats, action over-whelming.  The entrepreneurs will boldly dive into action, often without concern for purpose or strategy, but they&rsquo;re creative, and they know how to get things done.  The executives in transition have years of experience to draw upon and share, but are often redefining success for themselves and wrestle  with how to make the difference they hunger to make.  The introverts, while working on communicating more powerfully, teach the extroverts how to listen deeply, to observe closely, and ask powerful questions.  Designers teach operators how to find creative solutions.  Emerging leaders teach senior leaders how to forget all they think they know and to ask new questions.  And I have the best job in the world because I get to learn from all of them!</p><p> They all have something to teach and something to learn.   We all do.</p><p> What&rsquo;s so incredible about this world we live in, is that there&rsquo;s a different perspective every-which-way-we-turn.  The problem is, we tend to seek council from those who look at the world the same way we do.  Rather than learning from one another, we&rsquo;re simply re-enforcing our own beliefs and are bound by the limits of our strengths.  But that needn&rsquo;t be the case.</p><p> What if we were to challenge ourselves to  intentionally  turn to people who see the world through a different lens?  Who bring different talents?

{"original_id":3806,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why 2016 Should Not Be 'The Year of the Customer'","link":"why-2016-should-not-be-the-year-of-the-customer","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As fireworks lit up the night sky all around the world to welcome in another new year, millions of people were already deciding to commit to resolutions for the coming twelve months. Some resolutions were related to personal health and well-being. Some were financially related. Almost all of them will signify goals or challenges that must be met and overcome. As I sit here writing my first blog post of the year on the year on the 4th January, my online channels are being bombarded with a plethora of brilliantly worded articles suggesting a whole variety of resolutions that will transform the lives of individuals and companies alike.</p><p> I must admit that I am no different to most. I always enter a new year with certain aspirations &ndash; some formal; some informal. I do not always publicly or privately announce anything I intend to achieve, but psychologically I am always full of good intentions. I believe that to be the case with anyone who decides to create a single resolution, or indeed a list of multiple resolutions &ndash; they are always (well almost) very well intended.</p><p> The dictionary definition (I love a good definition!) of the word &lsquo;resolution&rsquo; is as follows:</p><p> a firm decision to do or not to do something</p><p> It is not that complicated! The key words in the definition are &lsquo;firm decision&rsquo; &ndash; a commitment in other words. Committing to change something &ndash; to stop doing or to do more of &ndash; that is what is not easy at all! The thing about resolving to do something &ndash; to change something &ndash; is that the act of resolution is not/should not be one that is finite. So many people and so many companies make decisions to change&hellip;&hellip;.. but very few are able to actually commit to making the change infinite.</p><br /><p> At the end of 2015, I wrote an article for my column on CustomerThink &ndash; the article was entitled  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerthink.com/customer-experience-in-2015-5-key-learnings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &lsquo;Customer Experience in 2015 &ndash; 5 Key Learnings&rsquo;  </a> </u>  &ndash; have a read if you would like to know what my key observations in 2015 were. If you do not want to read the full article, this is what I said about one of my 5 learnings &ndash; the one about &lsquo;commitment&rsquo;:</p><p> It still amazes me how much time and effort is being put into the subject of CX &ndash; all over the world &ndash; for such little reward. There are so many who have great intentions to transform their businesses, but either fail to commit to making change happen, or fail to get the commitment of others to do so. Getting people to acknowledge the importance of CX is relatively easy. Gaining acknowledgement of the need to change is also not that difficult. In fact, diagnosing what is causing the problem is also not too great a stretch.</p><p> HOWEVER&hellip; seeing businesses actually COMMITTING to doing something about the things that are causing customers most distress is where the wheels are falling off. I still hear too many companies saying, &lsquo;we know what the problems are&rsquo; &ndash; if you know what they are, then why are you not addressing them?! We are living in a business world that is swamped with data &ndash; most companies have KPIs coming out of their ears &ndash; yet when it comes to actually committing to fix the known drivers of customer dissatisfaction, PROCRASTINATION seems to be the norm.</p><p> If a business truly, authentically, genuinely wants to become more customer centric, it must make a firm COMMITMENT to understanding what its top priorities are and actually FIXING them. It needs to make a commitment to its customers and colleagues that is never ending. Customer Experience is not a fad. It is not a project. It is not a one off event. It is infinite.</p><p> Over the last 20 years, I have worked in and with companies who have resolved to make a commitment to doing something different. In recent times, some of those companies have resolved to make the new year,  <strong>  &lsquo;the year of the customer&rsquo; </strong> . Whilst I have always believed the intention to be right, I have now come to the belief that making the decision to do something like this will ultimately FAIL to make the resolution or commitment finite.</p><p> If most humans fail to commit to their resolutions as individuals, it is very likely that most companies will as well. Think about it this way &ndash; if 2016 is to be the year of the customer, what does that mean for the customer in 2017? If 2016 is the year of the customer, does that mean we do not have to care about the customer any other year? EVERY year should be the year of the customer &ndash; from now until eternity. Every year should be the year of the employee as well for that matter!</p><p> Too often Customer Experience is still being seen as a &lsquo;project&rsquo; or an &lsquo;initiative&rsquo; &ndash; both of these have a start and an end. To become a truly Customer Centric business, an organisation will need to change the way it thinks and works FOREVER &ndash; not for 12 months &ndash; not until something else that is more &lsquo;important&rsquo; comes along &ndash; but FOREVER.</p><p> So if your business has decided that 2016 is &lsquo;the year of the customer&rsquo; &ndash; do not panic. It is very likely to be statement full of great intentions. What you may want to consider is suggesting that 2016 signifies that &lsquo;next phase&rsquo; in the evolution of your company &ndash; one that recognises the importance of people (customers and employees) and how everyone from top to bottom can play their part in ensuring that PEOPLE  start 2016 at the TOP of every agenda and stay there&hellip;&hellip; FOREVER!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 20:51:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 20:51:54.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ObmhpME.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-2016-should-not-be-the-year-of-the-customer/\", \"post_id\": \"8369\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 20:51:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 20:51:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-2016-should-not-be-the-year-of-the-customer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8368\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3944\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-2016-Should-Not-Be-The-Year-of-the-Customer-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"554\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452019500,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3807,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Three Most Valuable “Secrets Of Sales Success\"","link":"the-three-most-valuable-secrets-of-sales-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When it comes to what it takes to be successful in selling, everyone has an opinion. Some say it all comes down to prospecting, or generating leads. Others talk about how it&rsquo;s all about closing skills. Or needs discovery. Social selling. Or wearing your lucky socks on pitch day.</p><p> But the truth is, there&rsquo;s very little truly scientific evidence on what it takes to achieve sales success. In the research leading up to our book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Insight-Selling-Surprising-Research-Differently-ebook/dp/B00K3KGZTC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Insight Selling&rdquo;  </a> </u> , RAIN Group identified three key things successful sellers (sales winners) do differently compared to everyone else. Three things that makes buyers loosen up the purse strings and say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p><h3> #1. Great Sellers  Connect . <br/>  </h3><p> The first secret of sales success that sales winners universally share is that they are able to connect &ndash; on two fundamental levels.</p><p> First, they connect with people. Not in an &ldquo;oh my gosh, you mean you also like to play golf ?!&rdquo; kinda way. It goes deeper than that. Great sellers deliver expertise, insights and business value in such a way that it builds strong relationships with buyers as valued peers and advisors. They build the personal relationships through delivering business value first.</p><p> But great sellers also make another kind of connection: they connect the dots. In particular, they are able to help a buyer see how their individual needs, desires, ambitions and goals connect directly to what the seller has to offer. In other words, they help a buyer see how their products and services are uniquely suited to solving the buyer&rsquo;s problem (or help them achieve their goals).</p><p> In short, great sellers connect &ndash; but something else has to happen as well.</p><h3> #2. Great Sellers  Convince . <br/>  </h3><p> Making strong connections is not enough. In order to get buyers out of the status quo, and firmly on the path to taking action, great sellers know they have convince &ndash; on three levels.</p><p> First, they have to convince the buyer that they can actually achieve the results they claim, and that those results are worth the investment. Second, they have to convince the buyer they are uniquely positioned to help them (read: better than everybody else). Third, they have to convince the buyer they are not only the best choice, but they are also the least risky option out there.</p><p> Most sellers &ndash; naively &ndash; continue to believe that, if they are able to connect with a buyer (&ldquo;build the relationship&rdquo;), find a problem to solve (&ldquo;find the pain&rdquo;) and help them see how they will be able to help them (&ldquo;present the solution&rdquo;), they&rsquo;ll close the sale. Great sellers understand that, in order to achieve sales success and get their buyer to take action, they have to take things one step further, and lay out a  <u>  convincing case to buy from them </u> .</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnU6Am62GJo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The 3 Most Powerful Keys To Breakthrough Sales Success  </a> </u></p><h3> #3. Great Sellers  Collaborate . <br/>  </h3><p> On the talking versus listening spectrum, there are two schools of thought. First, you&rsquo;ve got the &ldquo;nature-gave-you-two-ears-and-one-mouth-for-a-reason&rdquo; crowd. They believe that sellers should do mostly listening, let the buyer speak and  <u>  ask great questions </u> . Next, you&rsquo;ve got the &ldquo;seller-knows-best&rdquo; crowd. They believe that the seller (consultant, auditor, lawyer, &hellip;) is the real expert, and buyers should let the seller &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; the solution and follow their lead.</p><p> Both are right &ndash; and both are also wrong.</p><p> Let me explain. Think about your best friend/spouse/son/daughter. Now think about how you make important decisions together, like deciding where to go on holidays, or what restaurant to go to on Friday night. Do you listen to them ? Tell them what to do ? Ask question ? Tell them where you think you should go ?</p><p> Hopefully, the answer is &ldquo;a little of both&rdquo;.</p><p> That&rsquo;s exactly how things should be with your buyer. With all the rules, guidelines, &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; and well-intended advice out there, we sometimes forget we&rsquo;re dealing with other people. Not prospects. Not buyers. Not economic decision makers.</p><p> <strong>  People. </strong></p><p> And people like a little bit of back and forth. People like feeling they were a part of something. They have a hand in crafting their own destiny. Making up their own minds.</p><p> In short, people like to collaborate.</p><p> Great sellers get that. Which is why they&rsquo;re always looking for ways to collaborate with buyers &ndash; by educating with new ideas and perspectives, and bringing value to the table themselves. By being proactive and responsive, as the situation demands.</p><p> Great sellers are not born, they&rsquo;re made. And sales success secrets are not really secrets &ndash; if you know how to capture the learning and put them into practice.</p><p> Great sellers connect. Convince. And collaborate.</p><p> Now what about you?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 20:59:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 20:59:33.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_tn3Xyxt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-three-most-valuable-secrets-of-sales-success/\", \"post_id\": \"8370\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 20:59:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 20:59:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-three-most-valuable-secrets-of-sales-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8368\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3945\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-2016-Should-Not-Be-The-Year-of-the-Customer-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"354\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1451984400,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3808,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The True Heart of Money","link":"the-true-heart-of-money","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Money might be the target of your desire. The reason you work, get out of bed in the morning, maybe even the driving force behind the endless hours you devote to its creation. <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  You might believe that the more money you have, the happier you will be. </strong> You work, strive, invest, purchase lottery tickets, go to casinos and make deals in an effort to have more money. Some people call it the &ldquo;rat race.&rdquo;  But why do we do this? It is to validate our own success or do we have a higher purpose? Do we see money to confirm our place in the pecking order of friends, family and peers? Or is there a reason beyond our own ego satisfaction of climbing the ladder or impressing others?</p><p> While there are some who look at making money as a game&mdash;a challenge, a goal&mdash;most of us want money to meet the needs of our hearts. We&rsquo;re talking about feelings of satisfaction and safety; achievement; and the ability to create options attuned to our values. We have a desire for something important and meaningful to us, whether that&rsquo;s saving for your child&rsquo;s college or a life of choices in retirement  or just peace of mind that you won&rsquo;t run out of money in your later years.</p><p> <strong>  There&rsquo;s a difference between our true heart and our emotions around money. </strong></p><p> Our emotions are filled with wants and can be manipulated by those who know just where to tug. It&rsquo;s emotions that rationalize all the reasons why you &ldquo;should&rdquo; do something, but they have very little to do with your values.</p><p> Your true heart  starts  with your values.</p><p> Life in harmony with your money is centered and focused on what&rsquo;s most important to you, not allowing yourself to be distracted by what others would have you believe is important. The idea that, in order to appear successful, you have to act in ways that take you in the opposite direction is absurd.</p><p> Think of the money trap that is set and sprung for parents who, in trying to raise their kids, are made to feel that unless they hire tutors and coaches and enroll them in bassoon lessons at age three, they are crippling their child&rsquo;s chance at success and happiness. The financial result of this kind of pressure can be devastating.</p><p> Look at the young employee, trying to impress his boss, who believes that buying a top shelf wardrobe on the credit card is the right move. After all, you need to &ldquo;dress for success.&rdquo; And yet the financial burden might last long after the clothes have been dumped in the Goodwill bin.</p><p> Consider the family that cashes in their retirement investments so that their children can go to an expensive university. While Sally is being treated to an education costing mid-six figures, the parents&rsquo; security has been transferred to the Bursar&rsquo;s office. It&rsquo;s not that helping with your child&rsquo;s education is a bad thing. But sacrificing a secure retirement in exchange is losing sight of the real goal.</p><p> You might be thinking that this last example is NOT connecting your money and your heart. But what happens if you can&rsquo;t afford to fund that college&mdash;and you do it anyway&mdash;is no different than the emotions that tell you that you need to drive the most expensive car, go on the most impressive vacations and buy the biggest home, even when those choices threaten your financial security. It&rsquo;s a case of turning a &ldquo;Want&rdquo; into a &ldquo;Need.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  When making financial decisions, start with your values. With your heart. When it comes to your emotions, try taking a step back before saying &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; and make sure it truly fits with that which is most important to you. Your heart&mdash;given some room to breathe&mdash;will guide you to the best decision. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 21:01:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 21:01:51.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_b2ZKv1T.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-true-heart-of-money/\", \"post_id\": \"8372\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 21:01:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 21:01:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-true-heart-of-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8371\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3946\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-True-Hear-of-Money.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"704\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452013200,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3809,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Who Makes Resolutions Come True? YOU","link":"who-makes-resolutions-come-true-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The approaching New Year invites the contemplation of resolutions. Before setting goals and objectives for your personal life and your professional life, I suggest you consider a fundamental question.  <strong>  What&rsquo;s holding you back? </strong>  Now, its fair to say that I know nothing of your personal life, but I do know a thing or two about business life, having lived there more years than I care to remember.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s holding you back? </strong>  isn&rsquo;t as easy a question as it might seem. The intent of the query is not to unleash your frustrations about insufficient budgets, unreasonable customers, cantankerous bosses, or endless project lists &ndash; not that these matters are unimportant or should be overlooked. The operative word in the question is &ldquo;YOU.&rdquo; What are YOU going to do about the factors that are limiting your potential or your ability to reach for the stars without ending up with a handful of mud?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at this issue from a strategic perspective via a short check list:</p><li> <h3>  Define your goals </h3> <p>  You&rsquo;ve likely got something in mind already. High-achieving business types usually think in quantifiable terms, such as accelerating project due dates, reducing customer complaints, identifying cost reduction opportunities, driving  sales, increasing profit . . . you get my drift. Now go into the switch &amp; shift mode; think about YOU. Forget quantitative and consider the qualitative side of your business life. These are the &lsquo;softer&rsquo; factors that include empathy, stress, contentment, how you lead, how you inspire, and how you impact others. </p></li><li> <h3>  Define the constraints </h3> <p>  Most of the limitations will emerge from the goal definition exercise. Let&rsquo;s assume that you work in an overly complex business environment and red-tape is crippling decision-making, curtailing execution, and savaging the culture. </p></li><li> <h3>  Play out the &ldquo;What if . . .&rdquo; scenario </h3> <p>  Play it our as it applies to the limitations that are keeping you from your quantitative and qualitative goals. Start with &ldquo;what if there was no complexity?&rdquo; Your response will likely articulate what you would do better in an unencumbered world. This is important, but there is more to it. You must first address the things YOU must do to reduce the complexity cancer. For example, &ldquo;what are you prepared to sacrifice&rdquo; to help clear the way to a more focused environment. </p></li><li> <h3>  Develop an action plan </h3> <p>  Using Pareto&rsquo;s 80/20 rule (80% of the impact comes from 20% of the activity) to prioritize the few things that matter most, you are on your way to defining how YOU will make a difference. This is your vision. Compelling visions are the first step to creating meaningful changes.  <br/>    </p></li><p> I have seen so many cases of people accepting a status quo that is in dire need of alteration.

{"original_id":3810,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Hope for the New Year: 3 Asset Classes for 2016","link":"hope-for-the-new-year-3-asset-classes-for-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Earlier, I reflected back on 2015 by revisiting the  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/christmas-edition-2015-in-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   10 most popular posts of the year  </u>  . </a>  Today I&rsquo;d like to look ahead to 2016 by pinpointing three asset classes that I believe hold opportunities for investors.</p><h3> Gold <br/>  </h3><p> Going forward, gold prices will largely be affected by U.S. monetary policy. The Federal Reserve began its interest rate-normalization process with a small but significant 0.25 percent increase, and unless the Fed has reason to mark time or reverse course in 2016, rates should continue to rise steadily.</p><p> This will bump up not just the U.S. dollar&mdash;which historically shares an inverse relationship with gold, since it&rsquo;s priced in dollars&mdash;but also real interest rates. As I&rsquo;ve discussed many times before, real rates have a huge effect on the yellow metal.</p><p> Real interest rates are what you get when you deduct the rate of inflation from the 10-year Treasury yield. For example, if Treasury yields were at 2 percent and inflation was also at 2 percent, you wouldn&rsquo;t really be earning anything. But if inflation was at 3 percent, you&rsquo;d see negative real rates.</p><p> When gold hit its all-time high of $1,900 per ounce in August 2011, real interest rates were sitting at negative 3 percent. In other words, if you bought the 10-year, you essentially lost 3 percent a year on your &ldquo;safe&rdquo; Treasury investment. Since gold doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to hold, it became more attractive, and the metal&rsquo;s price soared.</p><p> But today, the U.S. has virtually no inflation&mdash;the November reading was 0.5 percent&mdash;so real rates are running at less than 2 percent.</p><p> Across the Atlantic, many investors are now realizing that Europe&rsquo;s quantitative easing (QE) programs have failed to improve market performance in any substantial way. Earnings per share growth estimates in the European stock market have not budged. The lack of real growth in this market is a compelling argument for global investors to own gold for the long term.</p><p> Low interest rates, higher taxes and tariffs and more labyrinthine global regulations since 2011 are all contributing to the global slowdown. Neither QE3 in Europe nor QE3 in the U.S. has led to a marked improvement in growth. What markets need now to ignite growth are fewer taxes, tariffs and regulations and smarter fiscal policies.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-european-earnings-per-share-eps-growth-estimates-not-responding-to-ecb-qe-12312015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"European Earnings per Share (EPS) Growth Estimates Not Responding to ECB QE\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-european-earnings-per-share-eps-growth-estimates-not-responding-to-ecb-qe-12312015.png\"/> </a></p><p> The chart below, courtesy of Evercore ISI, helps to illustrate some of the challenges we&rsquo;ve faced in 2015 in terms of the investments we manage. Growth remains scarce globally. M2 money supply in the U.S. also looks dim.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-global-trade-volumes-are-declining-12312015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global Trade Volumes Are Declining\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-global-trade-volumes-are-declining-12312015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Looking forward, we&rsquo;re hopeful that these two indicators&mdash;global trade volume and money supply&mdash;will turn up. Both are necessary to improve commodity and emerging market investments.</p><p> On the upside, gold demand in China remains strong. It&rsquo;s important to remember that more than 90 percent of demand comes from outside the U.S., in China and India in particular. Precious metals commentator  <u>  <a href=\"http://lawrieongold.com/2015/12/25/sge-rising-another-51-75-tonnes-withdrawn-week-49/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lawrie Williams  </a> </u>  reports that Chinese gold withdrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) crossed above 51 tonnes for the week ended December 18.</p><p> Already Chinese demand is higher than the previous annual record set in 2013, and if total withdrawals for 2015 climb above 2,500 tonnes, as Lawrie expects, this will be &ldquo;equivalent to around 80 percent of total global annual new mined gold production.&rdquo; We expect demand to rise even more as we approach the Chinese New Year&mdash;historically a key driver for gold&rsquo;s Love Trade&mdash;which falls on February 8 in 2016.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-16/COMM-Gold-seasonality-10162015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" 24 Hour Composite Historical Patterns\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-16/COMM-Gold-seasonality-10162015.png\"/> </a></p><h3> Oil <br/>  </h3><p> BCA Research believes oil markets will rebalance in 2016, not because of a price collapse but because production will continue to slide and consumption, grow. Most of these adjustments are being made in nonmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In the U.S. alone, over 600,000 barrels per day have fallen out of the market as the rig count falls.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-oil-production-falling-in-non-opec-nations-helping-to-rebalance-markets-12312015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Oil Production Falling in Non-OPEC Nations, Helping to Rebalance Markets\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-oil-production-falling-in-non-opec-nations-helping-to-rebalance-markets-12312015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Russia, however, is unwilling to cut its production in a bid to compete with OPEC. In November, the country hit a post-Soviet record of 10.8 million barrels produced per day. And even more oil is expected to come out of Iran in 2016 once international sanctions are lifted.</p><p> For these reasons, Moody&rsquo;s recently trimmed its 2016 oil forecast. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude will average $40 per barrel, down from $48, according to the ratings agency. The projection for Brent was slashed even more significantly, from $53 to $43.</p><p> To put this in perspective, oil averaged $55 per barrel in 2015, compared to $85 in 2014.</p><p> In all likelihood, then, oil prices probably need to remain lower for longer in order to rebalance the market.</p><h3> Airlines <br/>  </h3><p> Last month  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/this-industry-is-set-to-post-record-profits-on-lower-fuel-costs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I shared the latest report  </a> </u>  from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which states that global airlines will post record net profits of $33 billion for 2015. Because fuel prices are expected to stay low, airlines could very well hit another record at the end of 2016&mdash;$36.3 billion, according to the IATA.</p><p> Savings from lower fuel prices are partially to thank for these profits. Goldman Sachs points out, however, that we shouldn&rsquo;t expect prices to fall at the same magnitude as they did in 2014 and 2015.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-fuel-price-windfalls-tightening-up-12242015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Fuel Price Windfalls Tightening Up\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-fuel-price-windfalls-tightening-up-12242015.png\"/> </a></p><p> As a result of lower fuel prices and airlines&rsquo; improved discipline in capacity growth and capex spending, the group is poised to see increased operating margins in the coming years, according to Morgan Stanley.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/comm-us-airline-industry-operating-margins-are-expected-to-rise-in-2016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Airline Industry Operating Margins Are Expected to Rise in 2016\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/comm-us-airline-industry-operating-margins-are-expected-to-rise-in-2016.png\"/> </a></p><p> In short, operating margin tells you what percentage of every dollar made the company keeps as revenue before taxes. The higher the operating margin, the better off the company is.</p><p> Ancillary revenue is also contributing more to airlines&rsquo; bottom line. Such revenue comes from non-ticket fees such as baggage and handling, cancellations, seat upgrades, meals and the like. According to ancillary revenue expert IdeaWorks, the total global amount generated from these fees is estimated to rise to a whopping $59.2 billion in 2015, up from $49.9 billion in 2014. That accounts for 7.8 percent of global airline revenue, an improvement from the 6.7 percent in 2014.</p><p> <img alt=\"Global Ancillary Revenue From $2.5 Billion in 2007 to $59 Billion Estimated in 2015\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-12-31/COMM-Global-Ancillary-Revenue-59-billion-2015-12312015.jpg\"/></p><p> The increased revenue is helping to boost domestic airlines&rsquo; free cash flow. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast that airlines will see the highest free cash flow in years, one of the best indications of a company&rsquo;s ability to generate cash.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-04-02/comm-domestic-airlines-are-forecast-to-see-greatest-free-cash-flow-in-years_04022015-LG.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Domestic Airlines are Forecasted to See Greatest Free Cash Flow in Years\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-04-02/comm-domestic-airlines-are-forecast-to-see-greatest-free-cash-flow-in-years_04022015.gif\"/> </a></p><h3> Managing Expectations in 2016, a Presidential Election Year <br/>  </h3><p> As we reflect back on 2015, it&rsquo;s important to remember that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/files/pdfs/researchreports/2014/Managing-Expectations-Whitepaper-09-2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   everything happens in cycles  </a> </u> &mdash;from the presidential election cycle to the gold seasonality cycle and even to weather patterns. Similarly, every asset class has its own DNA of volatility.</p><p> By recognizing these cycles and patterns, it becomes easier to manage your expectations and become more proactive than reactive. With that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to focus specifically on opportunities and threats for the coming year. </p><p> 1. 2016 is the fourth year of the presidential election cycle. According to research by market historian Yale Hirsh&mdash;and later his son Jeffrey&mdash;markets have tended to perform well in presidential election years. Between 1833 and 2012, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on average  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aaii.com/journal/article/using-seasonal-and-cyclical-stock-market-patterns.touch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5.8 percent during election years  </a> </u> .</p><p> 2. After a flat year, 2015 being one of them, the market has historically been up, as you can see in the table below:</p>The S&amp;P 500 Has Rallied in Years after a Flat Year Following YearFlat YearS&amp;PEarnings1970+11%+25%1978+12%+6%1984+26%+5%1987+12%+16%1994+34%+11%2005+14%+9%2011+13%+9%Average+17%+12%Source: Evercore ISI, U.S. Global Investors<p> 3.

China, an essential market for commodities demand growth, continues to stimulate its economy with low interest rates and financial stimulus.</p><p> 5. As for potential threats, the biggest one in the new year continues to be global terrorism. Aside from the fact that it has increasingly made society feel less safe, terrorism reportedly cost the world $53 billion in 2014 alone, according to the latest data from the  <a href=\"http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#page/news/1277\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Institute for Economics and Peace  </u>  . </a>  That&rsquo;s the highest amount since 9/11.</p><p> I want to wish all of our readers and shareholders the very best in 2016!

{"original_id":3811,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Case Of The AWOL Owner","link":"the-case-of-the-awol-owner","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Professional advisors who work with business owners have all witnessed or heard about &ldquo;Seller&rsquo;s Remorse.&rdquo; Generally remorseful sellers are owners who sell before thinking about their post-business lives. After closing they feel empty and insignificant. While their businesses were ready to continue without the owner, the owner wasn&rsquo;t ready, emotionally or psychologically, to continue without the business.</p><p> The less common type of remorseful seller is the one who does not make it to the closing before realizing that they are too emotionally attached to their companies to let go. One BEI Member remembers one such owner.</p><p>              I once worked with an owner who told me he was eager to sell his company as soon as possible. Within a few months, we had put the company on the market and several buyers submitted offers in excess of my client&rsquo;s financial security goal ($4 million). This competition kicked off a bidding war in which buyers pushed their bids from $4M, to $6M, and then to $9M and $11M.</p><p>             I think it was at the $11M mark that the business owner disappeared. I don&rsquo;t mean that he stopped returning phone calls or responding to emails. I mean that nobody&mdash;friends, family or colleagues&mdash;could locate him for days.</p><p>             After much worry about his welfare, and some concern about how long the $11M offer would stay open, the owner reappeared. We were all relieved that he was alive and well, but I had to warn him that he was dangerously close to blowing the deal of a lifetime. His response took my breath away. &lsquo;Call off the deal. I&rsquo;ve thought long and hard about this and I don&rsquo;t want to sell. I have no idea what I&rsquo;d do with myself if I didn&rsquo;t have my company.&rsquo; I called my client&rsquo;s investment banker and had him withdraw from the transaction.&rdquo;</p><p> Pulling the plug on the sale process likely cost this owner tens of thousands of dollars in fees and lost productivity. Much costlier was the emotional damage the owner caused his family and himself. If there is an element of good luck in this story, it is that this owner realized  before the sale closed  that he would be lost without his business.</p><p> Owners may also be tempted to abandon a deal (and some do) during the buyer&rsquo;s due diligence. As you know, buyers use due diligence to assess a business as a possible investment and are intent on discovering, discussing, and not paying for, any deficiencies, warts, weaknesses, or unresolved issues that they uncover. Owners, on the other hand, can interpret the buyer&rsquo;s actions as a sudden and vicious attack on the very culture of the company and the legacy the owner thought he was leaving. After all, this business is part of the fabric of the owner&rsquo;s life. If the feeling of having one&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s work attacked isn&rsquo;t bad enough, owners can realize, perhaps for the first time, that their business will be transformed forever in the hands of this buyer. Unprepared owners can be caught off-guard and react by calling off the deal.</p><p> What can you do to prevent these scenarios? As an advisor, you can make a number of suggestions or recommendations to owners who are interested in selling to an outside party.  <u>  <a href=\"http://pages.exitplanningforadvisors.com/rs/746-SFR-321/images/Recommendations%20to%20Owners%20Selling%20to%20a%20Third%20Party.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here  </a> </u>  for a list of six recommendations you can discuss with your clients.</p><p> At the heart of every recommendation is the owner becoming knowledgeable about and comfortable with the decision to sell (or not).  Owners can benefit greatly from your input as an advisor experienced in Exit Planning.

{"original_id":3813,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Jet.com: How One Company Plans to Beat Amazon","link":"jet-com-how-one-company-plans-to-beat-amazon","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Founded by a seasoned e-commerce veteran,  <u>  Jet.com </u>  launched to much fanfare halfway through 2015 with designs on stealing some of the online shopping market share that Amazon enjoys. Rather than making their money on product sales, Jet launched with a model that was dependent on them making money from the annual membership fee. The company surprised many when it raised a massive $200 million in funding, and reached a nine digit valuation pre-launch. This membership model has since been dropped with the company focusing on revenue from discounted products.</p><p> What caught my eye in all of the coverage of Jet was the repeated mention of happiness as their differentiator. Not just customer happiness, but employee happiness.</p><p> Marc Lore, Jet&rsquo;s founder and chief executive, says that what will separate Jet from Amazon and others that have tried to carve a niche for themselves in the same space is happiness. In particular, <strong>  employee happiness. </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m constantly asking people at Jet if they&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; he said in an   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/technology/jetcoms-strategy-low-prices-fast-delivery-happy-workers.html\" target=\"_blank\">    interview   </a>  </u>   with the New York Times. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important for me to know that they love working here and think this is the best place they&rsquo;ve ever worked.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> While that might seem like an obvious place to focus efforts, it is a rarity in the world of high-valuation tech companies who are under pressure to focus on customer acquisition numbers. Many companies focus on employee happiness once other metrics have been reached, seeing it not as a business strategy, but rather as a business cost. This is what separates world-class organizations from those who languish in the shadows. By focusing on ALL stakeholders (employees, shareholders, customers) as a business strategy, you ensure that those most important to the business are in a position to further the goals of the organization.</p><p> When staff are happy and find satisfaction in their work, they arrive earlier, stay later, and feel part of something bigger than themselves. They sing the praises of the company to all who&rsquo;ll listen and refer their friends to work there. Companies that see employees as more than a cost, recognize that innovation doesn&rsquo;t only happen at the executive level. By empowering employees, you open the door to ideas and suggestions from the people working at the very points of the organization that can benefit from innovation. Focusing on customers is a no-brainer and Jet is addressing this partly with their faster delivery. Being able to acquire and retain loyal customers will allow them to earn and ultimately profit, something that the shareholders will certainly have an interest in.</p><p> Only time will tell if Jet can balance  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.storyforge.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purpose, people, products and processes  </a> </u>  profitably, but they are demonstrating an early commitment to focusing on more than just one metric &ndash; revenue. Revenue is an outcome of something else. Focus on the &ldquo;something else&rdquo;, in this case, the stakeholders, and you increase your chances of success dramatically. I&rsquo;m rooting for them.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 21:37:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 21:37:52.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_s6A1L5O.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/jet-com-how-one-company-plans-to-beat-amazon/\", \"post_id\": \"8381\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 21:37:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 21:37:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"jet-com-how-one-company-plans-to-beat-amazon\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8380\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3951\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-One-Company-Plans-to-Beat-Amazon.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"687\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452020400,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}

When she launched her consulting firm after a successful career as a Fortune 500 VP, her goal was clear: to build a national reputation (and thriving business) consulting, speaking and writing about her big idea.</p><p> Her potential client base was narrow: about 2,500 Fortune 1000 corporate VPs in jobs similar to the one she&rsquo;d just left behind. Toss in another 500 or so business association leaders that could bring her in to speak and she was pursuing maybe 3,000 people.</p><p> Hardly a number that intrigues big-name media or publishers to return your calls.</p><p> And yet it was exactly the right size for her.</p><p> Because she focused on her tribe. Her vision. The road they would travel together.</p><p> Selling her first book to a brand-name publisher was no small feat (and required advance purchasing enough copies that all the financial risk was hers).</p><p> At last count five years later, she&rsquo;d sold north of 20,000 copies.</p><p> Which would thrill many first-time authors, but Shannon didn&rsquo;t make her real money on book sales&mdash;and never planned to.  <strong>  The book was her calling card&mdash;her entr&eacute;e to five to six figure consulting gigs and the door opener to more/lucrative speaking gigs. </strong></p><p> Instead, she made the bulk of her income from high-impact, high-priced consulting assignments&mdash;typically a handful a year. One-shot clients brought in $125,000 a pop; recurring clients averaged $60,000 a year. Aside from the occasional freebie, her speeches ran $20,000+ (and usually included buying books for the audience).</p><p> So the math for a typical year looks something like this:</p><p> GROSS REVENUE</p><p> Consulting</p><p> New clients:             $ 250,000</p><p> Recurring clients:    $ 180,000</p><p> Speaking                            $ 200,000</p><p> Books                                  $   30,000</p><p> TOTAL                                $ 660,000</p><p> She&rsquo;d never make a living on book sales&mdash;but they continue to deliver qualified leads to the 3,000 or so folks in a position to hire her today (and those coming up behind them). She never makes cold calls and only the occasional warm one&mdash;her clients seek her out while she focuses on doing what she loves.</p><p> She follows a simple social media strategy that keeps her connected to influential media, clients and prospects. She has amassed about 10,000 Twitter followers and built a small but distinctive LinkedIn presence (her major social media platform). She&rsquo;s written two more books that keep her relevant and in-demand for speaking and corporate consults.</p><p> Not many people know her name outside of her industry. But within her tribe? She&rsquo;s one of the three leading voices in her field. Generous with her insight, impeccable in her work and committed to the future of her niche.</p><p> And making a very nice living in the process.</p><p> She didn&rsquo;t let her ego lead the quest for more followers, more website traffic, more subscribers. She leads with her head and serves from her heart.</p><p> Shannon&rsquo;s business and revenue model is uniquely hers. And that&rsquo;s pretty much the point.</p><p> You need to dig and create the model that best suits your talents, your vision and your audience. To decide which services and products to leverage&mdash;and how.</p><p> And maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;&ldquo;small&rdquo; will not only beat big, it will knock it out of the park.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-04 21:42:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-04 21:42:26.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_PECdnnH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-small-beats-big/\", \"post_id\": \"8383\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-04 21:42:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-04 21:42:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-small-beats-big\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8382\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3952\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/When-Small-Beats-Big-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1069\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/how-do-you-build-a-great-organization/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452016800,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3815,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Things You Need to Know About Fixed Index Annuities","link":"5-things-you-need-to-know-about-fixed-index-annuities","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Fixed  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/annuity/indexed-annuity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   index annuities  </a> </u> , or FIAs, can provide a wide variety of benefits to those who are approaching retirement. One of the biggest of these advantages can be a guaranteed lifetime income &ndash; regardless of how long the individual lives.</p><p> In addition, unlike most other tax-deferred retirement plans like an IRA or a 401(k) plan, an annuity does not have annual contribution limitations &ndash; meaning that it&rsquo;s holder can deposit a great deal more into these vehicles, and in turn, receive the added benefit of tax-deferred compounding on the funds inside.</p><p> Yet, while there are numerous benefits to owning an FIA, there are other attributes about these financial vehicles that a potential purchaser needs to know. Having a more thorough understanding of the inner workings of a FIA can help to avoid misunderstandings about what is occurring with an investor&rsquo;s funds &ndash; and in the long run, help to make owning an FIA that much more beneficial.</p><h3> <strong>  What You Need to Know About Fixed Index Annuities Prior to Moving Forward </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. An interest rate cap may be used in determining the FIA holder&rsquo;s overall return.</h3><p> <br/> There are certain types of fixed index annuities that will set a maximum rate of interest that the annuity can earn within a certain period of time. This is also referred to as a cap rate. Should the FIA holder choose an index that&rsquo;s increase is more than the cap amount, then the cap rate will be used in determining the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/annuity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   annuity  </a> </u>  holder&rsquo;s rate of interest.</p><h3> 2. A participation rate may be used in determining how much of the gain in the underlying index will be credited to the annuity.</h3><p> <br/> The annuity&rsquo;s participation rate will determine how much of the underlying index&rsquo;s increase will be used in computing the indexed interest rate. As an example, if an FIA holder&rsquo;s annuity uses a participation rate of 90%, then the annuity would receive 90% of the interest that is achieved within a certain time period.</p><h3> 3. With some FIAs, a spread is used for determining the return.</h3><p> <br/> In some cases, the indexed interest amount will be determined by subtracting a certain percentage from any gain that the underlying index achieves within a certain period of time. For example, should the annuity have a spread of 4% and the index increases by 9%, then the annuity would be credited with 5% indexed interest.</p><h3> 4. Be sure to understand surrender charges.</h3><p> <br/> Just as with other types of annuities, FIAs will also possess surrender charges within the first several years of ownership. Therefore, the money that is deposited into a fixed index annuity should be considered a long-term investment.</p><h3> 5.

Why not throw the same-old, same-old out the window? Stop using habits and the status quo as your default. Challenge yourself to stretch beyond your current capabilities. Stop playing it so safe; let go of the fear of making mistakes. Start asking different questions, looking at things with new eyes, and find the opportunities that lie in disruption. So, where should you start?</p><h3> Break out of your routine</h3><p> <br/> Your daily routine allows you to go on autopilot. In this mode you miss so many opportunities to see, experience, and brainstorm new things. Muster up the courage to lose a little of the control that your routine provides you. What a powerful way to break out of your every day behaviors. Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to become complacent. Disrupt the status quo, disrupt your habits, and disrupt your routine.</p><h3> Stimulate new ways of thinking</h3><p> <br/> Establish curiosity and continual learning as part of your very being. Surround yourself with those who think differently from you, who have a unique perspective. Encourage them to challenge you to think in new ways. Learn to ask great questions of both yourself and others. What new insights might you discover? Work on becoming more mindful. Small, positive changes in the way you think will make a big difference over time.</p><h3> Step out of your comfort zone</h3><p> <br/> When you step out of your comfort zone, you expose yourself to a world of new experiences. And, with experience comes confidence. What better place to build confidence than outside of your comfort zone? Stepping outside your comfort zone may put you at risk of making a mistake. You might even fail when trying something new. But, it also opens up your imagination, gives you a new perspective, and helps you to reframe the way you think about failure. Be willing to feel a little uncomfortable, learn from your mistakes, and seize the new opportunities that await you outside of your comfort zone.</p><h3> Learn from the unexpected</h3><p> <br/> When you disrupt your current way of thinking and behaving you are bound to encounter the unexpected. Our brains love to gravitate toward what is familiar; start to intentionally seek out the unfamiliar. Put yourself in new places and situations; surround yourself with new people. Shifting the way you think and behave is almost like giving yourself a fresh start. Challenge yourself, face the unexpected, learn the lessons that are out there for you, and never stop growing.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s Your Chance</h3><p> <br/> Stop repeating the bland, weak, ordinary things. Break out of your routine, stimulate new ways of thinking, step out of your comfort zone, and learn from the unexpected. Here&rsquo;s your chance; make it a disruptive new year!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-05 15:08:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-05 15:08:13.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ZKJRHCF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"post_id\": \"8387\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-05 15:08:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-05 15:08:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"make-it-a-disruptive-new-year\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8386\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3954\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Make-It-a-Disruptive-New-Year.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"647\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452111300,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

But I'm here to tell you, Apple Pay is going to take it on the chin. All because of stone-simple copper wire technology.<img alt=\"\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-05-at-7.41.15-AM-2.png\" width=\"405\"/>See that photo? See the weird copper-loop gizmo? That's what's inside a Samsung phone. That's the piece that kicks Apple's ass. Starting any minute now, and continuing throughout 2016. And beyond.<h3> If you're not a geek, stay with me, because I'm going to de-geekify all the Apple Pay baloney for you in about two seconds.</h3>The basis of Apple Pay is something called NFC, or near-field technology, which is kind of like walkie-talkie tech for letting your iPhone talk to credit-card machines (without making physical contact), okay, but the catch is, the credit-card machine (in order to participate) has to be one of the newer-fangled, next-generation machines built to do the NFC tango. Which most machines aren't.Obviously it's awesome (in theory) to be able to walk up to a check-out counter and wave your phone around and have a transaction go through, without your having to fish a plastic card out of your purse. That's an awesome concept. And it works great if you have Apple Pay on an iPhone and the merchant has a newer-fangled NFC machine. But most merchants don't have the NFC-style machinery, and honestly, can you blame them? Credit card gizmos are a hassle to upgrade. Just upgrading from magstripe to chip card capability is a pain, but going the extra mile for NFC? That's yet another level of upgrade hell. Most merchants aren't willing to do it just now.So in 2012, dig this, along come a couple of guys (Will Graylin and George Wallner) who decide to start a company called LoopPay, based on a really crazy idea: Put a copper-wire loop in a phone and use it to send out a disturbance in the Force (an old-school magnetic disturbance, not an NFC signal) specifically designed to spoof a card swipe, at a distance. You know that funky magnetic stripe on the back of your credit card? The one that's just a piece of magnetic tape embedded in the card, for cryin' out loud? The iron particles in that stripe are what the card machine responds to: You swipe the card through the slot, and the magnetized iron particles cause a ripple in the magnetic field between some sensors, and voila! Information is transferred. Well, imagine if you had bunch of strong magnets taped to the back of a card and you could wave the card at the machine from a distance of a couple inchesand achieve the same thing as a card swipe. The coil in a LoopPay device generates a magnetic field the old fashioned way, and does the same thing as tiny iron particles. It tricks a standard, non-NFC, old-school card swiper into thinking a credit card is nearby. It spoofs a swipe, at a distance. And yes, it's just that hacky. It's hilariously devious. It's low-tech. It's freakin' brilliant.So yes, what you're thinking is right: If you've got a phone with LoopPay inside, you can trick astandard old-fashioned 1999-vintage card reader into thinking you're doing a mag-swipe, from a distance (i.e., \"contactless\"). No fancy NFC tech needed. No upgrades necessary. Even your merchant will be surprised.Samsung saw the Graylin/Wallner technology in action and said \"Holy shit.

You decide. Samsung, meanwhile, is just getting started. Samsung Pay is just now appearing in the U.S. Over the next month or so, Samsung will be rolling out some new phone models, and the initial production run on the Galaxy S7 is said to be 5 million units. Yes, there are more iPhones with Apple Pay on them than Samsung phones with Samsung Pay, but the point is: Who's using Apple Pay? Practically no one.Who can accept Samsung Pay?

But something insidious was happening: Each year, the firm&rsquo;s revenues from this client shrunk. Even though this was a full-service law firm, with over a dozen major practice areas, their business with the client had shrunk to just two small practices. As a result, they were no longer on the General Counsel&rsquo;s radar&mdash;they had ceased being strategic for the client.</p><p> Yes, at the end each year this client still went in the &ldquo;retained&rdquo; column, and there was still some light applause for the partner in charge of it, but the relationship was a shadow of its former self.</p><p> The new Retention is Expansion. If you&rsquo;re not gaining either share of wallet or share of mind with a client, you&rsquo;re actually sliding backwards. If you aren&rsquo;t broadening your footprint and impact with a client, your relationship will shrink and you risk losing it entirely.</p><p> Put another way, if you aren&rsquo;t one of a client&rsquo;s top two or three advisors in your area of expertise&mdash;or on your way to becoming one of them&mdash;then you risk becoming increasingly irrelevant. You&rsquo;re a vendor to be managed.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s why this is true and what you need to do about it.</h3><p> <br/> First of all, client retention has always been a primary goal that I&rsquo;ve encouraged my own clients to seek. There are huge benefits to retaining an existing client. These include:</p><li> Realizing (instead of losing) the lifetime value of the client, which could be millions or tens of millions of dollars</li><li> Achieving lower sales costs and higher margins</li><li> Increasing your impact over time as you get to know the client better and better <br/>  </li><p> As competition has increased, however&mdash;and as clients have become more sophisticated and demanding&mdash;simply holding on to your existing business isn&rsquo;t enough. If you are doing the same things every year for your client, and also saying the same things to them, your position will slowly erode.</p><p> The Client Retention Matrix, below, illustrates this.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i4.createsend1.com/ei/r/FF/C28/3D9/csimport/RetentionGraphicforNewsletterV3.184118.jpg\"/></p><p> Share of Mind is driven by your thought leadership, ability to agenda set, and your overall strategic importance to the client. Think about your relationship with your personal physician versus someone who does occasional yard maintenance for you at your house. Share of wallet measures how much of the client&rsquo;s business, in your area of expertise, you have won.</p><p> At-Risk Retention occurs when you are in the lower-left portion of the matrix. You provide the same service or product every year, have low overall share of wallet for the client&rsquo;s spend in your area, and you are not considered a thought leader by the client&mdash;your &ldquo;share of mind&rdquo; is low. You can check the client retention and maybe even the high net promoter score box, but in reality your position is weak.</p><p> Defensible Retention is when you&rsquo;re in the upper-right part of the matrix. Here, you&rsquo;re expanding both your share of wallet and your share of mind. These are the best defenses against inevitable competitive incursions.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s an example of how this can play out.</h3><p>  </p><li> <strong>  As an illustration, let&rsquo;s suppose you supply IT services&ndash;application development and maintenance services&ndash;each year to your client. </strong> You are managed by a director in the IT department&mdash;maybe even a vice president.</li><li> <strong>  You are of course delighted to have a repeat, &ldquo;retained&rdquo; client. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Over time, however, your client will expect more value for their IT expenditures. </strong> They are under pressure to do more for less from their own shareholders and customers, and they will pass that pressure onto you. In fact, the CIO will likely be trying to spend less on routine &ldquo;keep the lights on&rdquo; IT work and more on strategic IT areas that directly support key business goals like customer acquisition, reducing time-to-market, and so on.</li><li> <strong>  As you are squeezed more each year on price, other competitors are calling on your client&mdash;both at the director and CIO level. </strong> Different competitors will be delivering several different messages&mdash;both of which undermine you: One will be that they can do it cheaper for your client; the other, that they can help the CIO become more strategic through a variety of value-added services (that you aren&rsquo;t talking to them about).</li><li> <strong>  As time passes, these forces&mdash;client demands for more value </strong> (through lower price, mainly) and that fact that your competition will be showing your clients new ideas and new services in an effort to win their business&ndash;will conspire to inexorably devalue the client&rsquo;s perception of what you do and the value you add.</li><li> <strong>  Consequently, you will start to look somewhat worn </strong> &mdash;like one of those mid-range motels that hasn&rsquo;t been very well maintained over the years. <br/>  </li><p> You&rsquo;re probably saying, &ldquo;This assumes I don&rsquo;t do anything to prevent all this.&rdquo; True, but answer this question: Do you or your firm have repeat clients that you are taking for granted and for which you are not upping your game each year? Of course you do. Everyone does.</p><p> Maybe most of these clients are small or unimportant. But I bet some of them are large and important&mdash;and you&rsquo;re not doing enough. You&rsquo;re not proactively agenda setting with them. You&rsquo;re not talking to them regularly about new and different ways you can help them. You&rsquo;re not investing to take deep dives into issues of special interest to them. You&rsquo;re not exposing them to the full range of value your firm can add.</p><p> An extreme example of this is what happened in the cellphone market. When Apple&rsquo;s iPhone came out in 2007 and gave customers the Internet in their palm&mdash;and they experienced its integrated suite of software and beautiful design&mdash;regular cellphones suddenly seemed like dated pieces from a museum. One of the consequences was the extraordinary collapse of traditional handset suppliers like Nokia and Motorola. In fact, Motorola&rsquo;s market share of cellphone handsets went from over 50% of the North American market to almost zero in just a few years.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve seen other dramatic examples like this in services markets: Bill Bain introduced strategy consulting with implementation and took share from McKinsey; Egon Zehnder innovated in the executive search business and built a major firm that created its own rules of engagement; law firms like Wachtel developed the poison-pill takeover defense; Market research firms like Gallup got into the management consulting business on the back of innovative research and book publishing; and so on.</p><p> Less dramatic, but common on a daily basis, is the gradual erosion caused by your competitors. They are calling on your clients and sharing their latest thinking about issues of importance. They are asking for the opportunity to compete for the business you are currently getting. They are showing more enthusiasm and creativity than you are. Add client budget pressures on top of that, and this slow erosion can turn into a catastrophic sinkhole overnight!</p><p> What then happens, if you&rsquo;re not actively growing the relationship, is that at some point the client will say to one of your competitors, &ldquo;Sure&mdash;show us a proposal to do that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> So your goal is no longer just to retain a client. Your goal is to expand the relationship both in terms of share of wallet and share of mind to create &ldquo;Defensible Retention.&rdquo; You have to do this not only because it&rsquo;s a positive thing to do in its own right, but also because if you don&rsquo;t you may end up with nothing.</p><h3> In conclusion, think about these questions: <br/>  </h3><li> Are you gaining share of mind by consistently delivering relevant thought leadership to your client in your area of expertise, and connecting what you do to your client&rsquo;s broader business issues?</li><li> Are you gaining share of wallet by both expanding into new parts of your client&rsquo;s organization and by identifying new solutions you can offer them?</li><li> Do you have some clients you are retaining but who are in the &ldquo;At-Risk Retention&rdquo; zone? What should you be doing about them?</li> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-05 16:09:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-05 16:09:43.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_QCvuObT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-client-expansion-not-retention-is-the-new-measure-of-relationship-success/\", \"post_id\": \"8395\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-05 16:09:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-05 16:09:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-client-expansion-not-retention-is-the-new-measure-of-relationship-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8394\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3957\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-Client-Expansion-is-the-New-Measure-of-Relationship-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"800\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452142800,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3820,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why I'd Fund Daenerys If She Were a Silicon Valley Entrepreneur","link":"why-id-fund-daenerys-if-she-were-a-silicon-valley-entrepreneur","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SanFranciscoVC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Phil Sanderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://sfvc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SFVC  </u> </a></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Game of Thrones with it, Momma&rdquo; <br/> Drake, &ldquo;You &amp; The 6&rdquo;</p><p> Since investing in  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.telltalegames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Telltale Games  </a> </u> , I&rsquo;ve become a big fan of Game of Thrones, both the game and the television series. Like millions of other fans, I love the characters. One of my favorites is Daenerys Targaryen for a very predictable reason: she&rsquo;s an awesome entrepreneur.</p><h3> If Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, pitched me a Series A plan for retaking Westeros, I&rsquo;d write her a check for $5 million.</h3><p> <br/> Like the startup founders I back, Daenerys packs a combination of smart business ideas and winning qualities that are necessary for successful entrepreneurship. It&rsquo;s also an advantage that Daenerys is a woman&ndash;&ndash;according to various  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/geristengel/2015/01/07/11-reasons-2015s-outlook-for-women-entrepreneurs-is-coming-up-roses/\" target=\"_blank\">   research  </a> </u> , female entrepreneurs are more likely than their male counterparts to deliver a high ROI. (Good thing our IDG Ventures portfolio consists of more female founders than  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/women-hold-just-11-of-executive-positions-at-silicon-valley-tech-companies-2015-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the industry average  </a> </u> .)</p><p> So back to the great Daenerys. What makes her such an ideal entrepreneur? Let me count the ways.</p><h3> 1. Confidence <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Confident Daenerys\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/confident-daenerys.jpg?w=635\"/> <br/> As an entrepreneur, confidence is especially potent when you manifest it both internally (having self-confidence) and externally (inspiring others to have confidence in you).</h3><p> <br/> This is the type of confidence that Daenerys possesses, even when she is an enslaved and beleaguered teenager.</p><p> Being confident is easy enough when things are going your way. True confidence persists even and especially when nothing is going your way. Or when you&rsquo;re the least knowledgeable or experienced person in the room. Daenerys-style confidence is remaining confident despite the self-awareness that you&rsquo;re inexperienced in battle (or business), leveraging worthy advisors, and then executing on a decision that you own.</p><p> Put another way, really confident people don&rsquo;t see let their deficits dampen their confidence. Instead, they tap external resources, quickly learning whatever it takes to fill any necessary knowledge gaps.</p><h3> 2. Visionary <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Daenerys Strategic\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/daenerys-strategic.jpg?w=635&amp;h=422\"/> <br/> Truly iconic visionaries like Steve Jobs have a magical quality about them. </h3><p> <br/> They dazzle us with creations that seem pulled from a top hat. Daenerys has this spell-binding effect as a visionary. The perfect visionary-as-magician representation of Daenerys is the pyre scene. It&rsquo;s a big moment of crisis, and the end looks near for Daenerys and her team. And then magically, Daenerys produces a solution that awes the crowd. It&rsquo;s a giant funeral pyre that she walks into and emerges from unscathed. Victory.</p><p> It all looks unplanned and instantaneous, but behind-the-scenes, visionaries approach it more like a game of chess. There&rsquo;s a lot of analysis and thinking two steps ahead.</p><p> I love this Daenerys quote for its powerful message and vision:</p><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;m not going to stop the wheel. I&rsquo;m going to break the wheel. </strong></p><h3> 3. Strong Moral Compass <br/>  </h3><h3> <img alt=\"Daenerys Moral\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/daenerys-moral.gif?w=635\"/> <br/> Business is about relationships&ndash;&ndash;the people you know and how you treat them.</h3><p> <br/> If you have bad business practices, then people stop doing business with you. If you practice good business ethics, people keep doing business with you and they tell their friends. It&rsquo;s as simple as that, and Daenerys excels at it.</p><p> Daenerys may have her flaws, but she treats everyone well regardless of class and always has good intentions. Her most emblematic moment as a person with strong morals: freeing the slaves.</p><p> Long-term entrepreneurial success requires always doing the right thing (or at least trying hard to).</p><h3> 4. Competitive <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Daenerys competitive\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/daenerys-competitive.jpg?w=635&amp;h=343\"/> <br/> For entrepreneurs like Daenerys, winning is only one part of the competition; the other is total annihilation of the opponent.</h3><p> <br/> The ideal entrepreneur has a strong moral compass, but she&rsquo;s hardly a pushover. Her competitiveness is fierce and ruthless, inciting fear and surrender in her enemies. She knows exactly where to strike because she has thoroughly researched her opponent&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. </p><p> The takeaway: all entrepreneurs are competitive, but successful entrepreneurs are competitive in a strategic way.</p><h3> 5. Inspirational Leader <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Daenerys leadership\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/daenerys-leadership.gif?w=635\"/> <br/> In the Game of Thrones world, dragons are wild beasts incapable of obeying orders from anyone&ndash;&ndash;with the exception of Daenerys, who can communicate with dragons and get them to do her will. </h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s pretty special. The effect that Daenerys has on the people she leads, from slaves to dragons, is beautiful leadership in action. She motivates, challenges, and rewards her team; they, in turn, are inspired to do excellent work (not to mention pledge their undying loyalty to Daenerys). Here&rsquo;s a testimonial on Daenerys&rsquo; leadership that sums it up well:</p><p> <strong>  You would be not only respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times that I look at you, and I still can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re real.  <br/>  ―Ser Jorah Mormont </strong></p><p> Inspirational leaders have the ability to connect emotionally with all types of people. Entrepreneurs who have this gift attract the best talent, and they bring out the best in people.</p><h3> 6. Agile <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Daenerys Agile\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/daenerys-agile.gif?w=635\"/> <br/> &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just the word-of-the-day, it&rsquo;s the skill-of-a-lifetime. </h3><p> <br/> Agile entrepreneurs and their agile startups are frequently successful because they move more quickly and effectively than everyone else. The agile mindset is defined by a few simple principles: <br/>  </p><li> Fear not failure</li><li> Fail fast</li><li> Learn faster</li><li> Do better</li><li> #Winning (again) <br/>  </li><p> Daenerys practices and preaches the above approach in every endeavor, from campaigns to wars. She&rsquo;s forgiving when her team fails, but she&rsquo;s tough about learning the lessons and applying improvements.</p><p> Agility is characterized by two additional qualities: adaptability and resourcefulness. Like a bootstrapped startup, Daenerys has run big operations on meager resources. But she nevertheless adapts and gets the job done.</p><p> Great entrepreneurs often do &ldquo;mini-pivots,&rdquo; or slight adjustments, in response to changing business conditions. Many of our portfolio companies have succeeded on a business plan that was modified along the startup journey.</p><h3> 7. Resilient <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Daenerys resilient\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/daenerys-resilient.gif?w=635\"/> <br/> Even through major setbacks, Daenerys always soldiers on&ndash;&ndash;surrender is never an option.</h3><p> <br/> Resilience starts with the expectation that the road of entrepreneurship is fraught with hardships. Then it&rsquo;s about overcoming each hardship while remaining focused and positive. Daenerys explains it perfectly:</p><p> <strong>  Getting what you want isn&rsquo;t easy &mdash; and you shouldn&rsquo;t expect it to be. Hard work pays off. </strong></p><p> For entrepreneurs, failures are the stepping stones to success. You need resiliency to persist and progress to the finish line.</p><h3> 8. Funding Rainmaker <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Daenerys Army\" src=\"https://sanfranciscovc.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/daenerys-army.png?w=635\"/> <br/> Fundraising is hard. Really hard.</h3><p> <br/> You have to be thick-skinned (see Resilient above) because you&rsquo;ll encounter plenty of rejection. Sometimes, you don&rsquo;t even get the courtesy of a direct rejection. You simply don&rsquo;t hear back from investors. This happens to venture capitalists when we pitch our investors: LPs.</p><p> Daenerys experiences a harsher rejection when she tries to convince the Spice King to fund her mission with his ships. Not only does the Spice King reject Daenerys&rsquo; pitch, he is condescending and sexist towards her. Daenerys, of course, gets over it, ultimately procuring the necessary resources for her quest to retake the Iron Throne.</p><p> Fundraising is a typical part of the startup process. For many entrepreneurs, investment capital is a necessity for launching or growing a company. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s crucial to be good at fundraising. If you have or develop all the qualities described above and you nail the business plan, you will eventually get a smart VC&rsquo;s attention and support.</p><p> *                 *                *                *</p><p> Whether in life or fantasy, I love seeing awesome models of entrepreneurship. Daenerys may be a fictitious person, but her exemplary qualities as an entrepreneur are very real. The good news is that these qualities can be adopted and developed. So get into the habit of identifying and studying great entrepreneurs, even those from another world.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-05 16:25:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-05 16:25:37.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_aDEo2G3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-id-fund-daenerys-if-she-were-a-silicon-valley-entrepreneur/\", \"post_id\": \"8397\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-05 16:25:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-05 16:25:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-id-fund-daenerys-if-she-were-a-silicon-valley-entrepreneur\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8396\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3958\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-I\\u2019d-Fund-Daenerys-If-She-Were-A-Silicon-Valley-Entrepreneur.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1211\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452087000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Yet the research indicates this doesn&rsquo;t carry enough weight in people&rsquo;s decisions.</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. The typical combined 401(k)/IRA balance is a slim $111,000 for working households between 55 and 64 years old that have a 401(k). And fewer and fewer retirees have defined benefit pensions, which provide reliable income. More than half of us are at risk of experiencing a decline in our standard of living after we retire,  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/briefs/nrri-update-shows-half-still-falling-short/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estimate  </a> </u>  economists at the Center for Retirement Research, which supports this blog.</p><p> Yet a recent survey by  <u>  Fidelity </u>  indicated that the majority don&rsquo;t think about the financial impact of their retirement timing. Retirees and pre-retirees said leisure was a major reason they have retired or would retire &ndash; even if they were falling short of their financial goals.</p><p> The most  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/desperate-to-retire-don%E2%80%99t/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   powerful route  </a> </u>  to improving workers&rsquo; prospects is to delay retirement, which dramatically increases  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/getting-what-you-need-for-retirement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   monthly  </a> </u>  Social Security benefits and the income that can be withdrawn from a  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/behavior/the-mathematics-of-longevity-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   401(k)  </a> </u> .</p><p> But Mark Zoril, a Minnesota financial planner, said pre-retirees typically do not drill down into their finances, though they have a vague idea of where they&rsquo;re at. What he often sees is that an important change precipitates the timing of a retirement, whether a friend&rsquo;s retirement or deteriorating health.</p><p> &ldquo;They get to a point where they&rsquo;re ready to go, and what they&rsquo;ll conclude &ndash; for better or worse financially &ndash; is they&rsquo;re either going to be okay or they&rsquo;ll figure it out,&rdquo; he said.</p><p> Academic research confirms people retire for myriad reasons, which interact in complex ways. But in one such  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/what-derails-a-planned-retirement-date/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u> , financial considerations were analyzed, and they barely registered as a factor in the decision for those who retired earlier than planned.

These discussions took place across the country.</p><p> Reading about the subjects they discussed and the conclusions reached in the conference Final Report was not a surprise to us at AgingInvestor.com, as we are in the field. But one thing did surprise me completely:   <strong>  no one gave much mention to the need for thorough financial education and planning with professional help. </strong></p><p> There was mention of the Department of Labor&rsquo;s initiative to facilitate State creation of retirement savings programs.  There was also discussion of the  <strong>  U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s </strong>  recently issued guidance clarifying that employers sponsoring defined benefit pension plans generally may not offer lump sum payments to retirees to replace their regular monthly pensions. As noted in a recent Government Accountability Office report, such lump sum payments transfer longevity risk and investment risk from employers to individual retirees, putting retirees at risk of being unable to maintain their standard of living or outliving their assets in retirement.  Wouldn&rsquo;t financial advice help?   <strong>  No mention was made of the value of at least seeking advice from financial professionals to maintain income while investing responsibly </strong>  for those who did get a lump sum payment.</p><p> The report emphasizes the need for providing lifetime income and seems to favor employers offering annuities as part of retirement planning. The Treasury and Labor Departments previously have issued a series of guidance documents encouraging plan sponsors to offer responsible annuity options to help protect retirees from outliving their savings.</p><h3> The Gap <br/>  </h3><p> That may work for some, but I found myself at a loss as to why mention was not made of the importance of professional guidance in financial planning, which may be the best way to ensure that an individual does not, in fact outlive his savings.  That&rsquo;s your job.</p><h3> Opportunity for Financial Advisors <br/>  </h3><p> An obvious opportunity for financial advisors is to offer financial education to members of the public. Some attendees will not have enough to make new investments, but others will.  With 10,000 people turning 65 every day and the oldest boomers turning 70 now, financial advisors can play a key role in helping aging members of society do better with managing their money as they age. Advisors can improve the sometimes negative public perception of the industry by stepping up, putting on few seminars with the basics of saving and investing and capturing some new clients in the process. </p><p> <strong>  You will also have a chance at any seminar you offer to give some tips on elder financial abuse.  </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-05 20:31:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-05 20:31:56.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_dkF2IvD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-final-report-from-the-white-house-conference-on-aging-little-mention-of-the-need-for-financial-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"8410\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-05 20:31:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-05 20:31:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-final-report-from-the-white-house-conference-on-aging-little-mention-of-the-need-for-financial-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8409\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3963\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Final-Report-From-The-White-House-Conference-on-Aging.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"430\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452082500,"author_id":91,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3826,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Stop Feeling Guilty About Your Money","link":"how-to-stop-feeling-guilty-about-your-money","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Let&rsquo;s be honest. For most people, thinking or talking about money ranks right up there with getting a root canal. Most people would rather talk openly about their sex lives with a stranger than actually share the status of their finances.</p><p> While there are a variety of emotions, backgrounds and experiences that we each have around money that contributes to an uneasiness to discuss it, feeling guilty and insecure about our money generally boils down to an overall lack of clarity as to what&rsquo;s going on with it and a lack of education as to how to fix or get it on track once we have identified the issues.</p><p> Ultimately, there&rsquo;s no sugar coating it.  <u>  If you want to start making smart choices with your money, you have to take action </u> . Your finances won&rsquo;t fix themselves just like you won&rsquo;t lose weight by doing nothing or earn that college degree by slacking off in the back row of class.</p><p> If you want to get rid of your money guilt and insecurity once and for all, follow the below steps to get yourself on track.</p><p> <strong>  Determine the areas you want to make progress in. </strong></p><p> Money. It&rsquo;s an all-encompassing word. It covers everything from budgets, to net worth, to spending patterns, insurance coverage, retirement and more. It&rsquo;s no wonder it&rsquo;s overwhelming to think about getting it all under control. How does one even know where to start?</p><p> Our instinct is to dive right in and tackle it all, but your best bet is to handle this as you would any other large project or undertaking. Break it down into bite size pieces. Where is your attention needed most? Do you need to get better at tracking your spending? Has it been a while since you&rsquo;ve checked in on your investments? Do you have too much money sitting in cash? Should you be saving more? Have you set up your retirement accounts? Is there a better strategy you could be using for your credit card pay down?</p><p> Pick 2-3 areas that you want to make progress on and commit to working on those over the next few months. Once you&rsquo;ve gotten those areas on track, you can move on to others.</p><p> <strong>  Create a goal for each area. </strong></p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve determined the areas you want to work in with your finances, set goals for yourself.</p><p> Nevermind the general goals of &ldquo;I want to pay off my debt&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to start building my emergency fund.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the same as saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to lose weight.&rdquo; Great &ndash; but how much weight are you planning on losing? And by when?</p><p> It&rsquo;s pretty hard to celebrate a win when you&rsquo;re limiting yourself from the beginning by not having a place to measure progress from. Skip the hassle of creating big picture goals for yourself and drill down into what it is that you specifically want to accomplish in each area and when you want to do it by. Your goals should be quantified and measurable so you can actually celebrate your progress along the way.</p><p> <strong>  Schedule your money time.  </strong></p><p> A good way to start kicking your guilt to the curb is to start paying more attention to your money. Schedule time each week to sit down and review your goal progress and evaluate areas there may be room for improvement.</p><p> Set a recurring date on your calendar and include an agenda in the notes section. Your agenda may include the following:</p><li> <strong>  Review expenses and savings. </strong>  Which categories are you above and under on?</li><li> <strong>  Track progress on goals and paying down debt.  </strong> Did you add to balances, pay down debt, or stay even for the month?</li><li> <strong>  Make adjustments. </strong>  Where do you need to change to stay on track?</li><li> <strong>  Celebrate wins. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Establish Your Values and Priorities. </strong></p><p> Money guilt can stem from a variety of factors, but what typically brings on this guilt is the fact that we&rsquo;re not using our money to live a life we value. We know that by not tracking our spending or saving for retirement or even that big vacation, our money isn&rsquo;t going towards those things we value or prioritize in our lives.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a famous quote from James W. Frick where he says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me where your priorities are. Show me where you spend your money and I&rsquo;ll tell you what they are.&rdquo;</p><p> Think about your finances. Is it the tangible or intangible things that motivate you? Do you get excited about possessions or experiences? What are you saving for right now?</p><li> How will reaching your goals make you feel? Secure? Free? Powerful?</li><li> What&rsquo;s the ultimate reason behind your desire to earn more, save more or experience more? How does it translate into your life? <br/>  </li><p> <u>  Keeping your &ldquo;why&rdquo; in mind will help to keep your finances in line when faced with the tough decisions </u> .</p><p> Money is a tough topic to tackle and it&rsquo;s okay to be uncomfortable with it. What&rsquo;s not okay to do is stick your head in the sand. Take small steps, schedule focus time, set clear cut goals and you&rsquo;ll likely find that the more attention you pay to working through and out of the issues, the better and stronger you&rsquo;ll feel about your money.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-05 20:43:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-05 20:43:21.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_0W0wezs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-stop-feeling-guilty-about-your-money/\", \"post_id\": \"8412\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-05 20:43:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-05 20:43:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-stop-feeling-guilty-about-your-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8411\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3964\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Feel-Guilty-About-Money-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"743\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452076200,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3827,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Empowering Cultural Behaviour as Driver for Diversity","link":"empowering-cultural-behaviour-as-driver-for-diversity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Put a group of people together and you will discover there are many corresponding and contradicting characteristics, beliefs and opinions in that one room. These can level, reinforce, but also sabotage a situation. If you want to strengthen your business, how can you ensure that the first two values, the ones that create synergy, will dominate within your organisation? It&rsquo;s all about behaviour and the culture that is steering that behaviour. <br/> <br/> Recently I read  <u>  <a href=\"http://talent.linkedin.com/blog/index.php/2015/06/cultural-fit-rarely-matters-in-sports-and-why-businesses-should-hire-jerks\" target=\"_blank\">   an article on Linkedin  </a> </u>  about Michael Jordan&rsquo;s attitude as a &lsquo;jerk&rsquo; and how that was actually empowering his team, not sabotaging it. The writer states that hiring for cultural fit is overrated. Is it? In sports you often hear outrageous behaviour from leading talents. What happened first, their success or their jerky, arrogant outbursts? So you could question what causes what in these cases. How does this work within companies?</p><h3> Diversity <br/>  </h3><p> One of the biggest issues within companies is gender diversity. Why is the largest part of executives boards still male? Why are man and women paid unequally for the same jobs? A study of the Dutch business intelligence company Graydon has concluded that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hrpraktijk.nl/topics/strategisch-hr/nieuws/vrouwen-de-boardroom-verlagen-de-kans-op-faillissement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   having women in the management board  </a> </u>  mitigates the risk of bankruptcy. Also at McKinsey&rsquo;s they concluded that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/lessons_from_the_leading_edge_of_gender_diversity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   women on boards  </a> </u>  are a real advantage. More and more large American enterprises hire women for executive jobs. For example General Motors, IBM and PepsiCo have female CEOs. They don&rsquo;t hire women for such executive jobs to meet KPIs of a diversity program. It is more likely these women got hired because &ndash; besides their leadership skills &ndash; of all candidates they fit the company culture best.</p><h3> What does cultural fit actually mean? <br/>  </h3><p> Well, the probability that a candidate will be able to adapt to your organisation. The adaptability is based on the beliefs, attitudes and behaviours that are characteristic for your organisation. Eventually this set of cultural pillars is defined in core values, that only last if they are lived by every day, top down. So, like most organisational dependencies do, this starts with leadership.</p><p> Culture is a strong influencer of people&rsquo;s views, values, hopes, respect, loyalties and fears. Not only the culture you were born in has affected you, the cultures you are part of due to social or work activities will affect of have affected you too. Whether you are male or female, Dutch, Italian, Chinese or American, gay or straight, it influences the way you interact in life. So when you are working with a diversity of people, it helps to have some perspective and understanding of each other&rsquo;s cultures in order to build relationships. However, the question is, will this hinder cultural fit within an organisation that aims to achieve an certain level of diversity?</p><h3> Culture encourages diversity <br/>  </h3><p> In addition to the interesting recruitment suggestions in the article &lsquo;Recruiting for cultural fit&rsquo;, it also mentions that culture fit could lead to discrimination against candidates and a lack of diversity. Such assumptions arise due to misunderstanding the concept of hiring for cultural fit. It is not about only hiring people that are the same. Diversity will not be confined by values and believes. There&rsquo;s still a wide range of possibilities within the boundaries of these pillars. The cultural behaviour of the workforce needs to allow differences in the way people deal with operational issues. Trust people in their judgement within the boundaries of their &lsquo;playground&rsquo;. <br/> Although multicultural work environments can be a challenge, it&rsquo;s also important to remember how much people have in common. We all see the world differently, but we all know what it is like to wake up in the morning and look forward to or maybe look up to the challenges of that day. We all love, learn, hope and dream. We all have experienced pain and have overcome fear in our lives.</p><p> If you create a company culture that encourages employees to be broad-minded, it will create a platform where diversity is widely accepted. A place where executives, male or female, have the opportunity to steer their employees towards the same results.</p><p> Therefore HR needs to enable hiring for cultural fit by translating the organisation&rsquo;s culture into terms of values, goals, and practices and then incorporate this understanding into the hiring process. This way recruitment can attune their search for talents.</p><h3> Bottom line <br/>  </h3><p> Gender, ethnicity or age are not the detrimental factors of fitting in. When employees fit the company culture well because they thrive within an environment that is tolerant on differences , it increases job satisfaction, performance and creates a solid base for diversity. Benefits that will have a positive chain reaction on the company results.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-05 20:46:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-05 20:46:20.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_NM4vjsE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/empowering-cultural-behaviour-as-driver-for-diversity/\", \"post_id\": \"8414\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-05 20:46:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-05 20:46:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"empowering-cultural-behaviour-as-driver-for-diversity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8413\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3965\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-05-at-12.44.44-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"483\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452106800,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}

Like everything in life, there is a right way to use this platform and many wrong ways. Unfortunately, I see a lot of the wrong ones.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s right? <br/>  </h3><p> Working in financial services, many of you who are registered reps will probably not be able to use this platform at all. The compliance to monitor Pinterest is not solid yet and if you post something, you all know it must be able to be monitored. For those who can use the platform, it&rsquo;s a great way to share (or &ldquo;pin&rdquo; as they call it on this platform) interesting articles, motivational quotes and even a few pictures of fun things (&hellip;er, I might have an entire board devoted to bacon).</p><li> <strong>  Pin content interesting to your followers. </strong>  If you sell Medicaid Supplement insurance, what does the majority of this group like talking about? This might not only include a board for the MedSupp articles you write or like, but also home improvement projects, tips on frugal shopping and even some recipes. Whatever your audience likes and knows, share content that talks directly to them.</li><li> <strong>  Pin content at least once a week. </strong>  Your boards need to have consistent content like any other platform. Be sure to pin at least once a week to show up in newsfeeds.</li><li> <strong>  Share your pinned content on another platform. </strong>  Once you pin an article, share it to your LinkedIn account as an update. Cross-promotion of content is encouraged! <br/>  </li><h3> So, what&rsquo;s wrong? <br/>  </h3><p> Remember your boards are a reflection of you and your business. Perception is the reality; whether we like it or not.</p><li> <strong>  Make sure your profile picture is appropriate. </strong>  I recently visited an insurance consultant&rsquo;s Pinterest board where they are taking a selfie, in the bathroom with bathroom types of things around (if you know what I mean). Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think so. Try and use the same profile picture you did for LinkedIn instead. The synergy will be useful when you cross-promote your pins to other platforms.</li><li> <strong>  Check your content before pinning. </strong>  If you see another pin on Pinterest you feel would be great to share, be sure and open it and make sure it goes to an actual article. A lot of people are using click-baiting as a marketing tactic (basically posting about one thing and then make you click through to something else unrelated) and this will turn your followers off &ndash; big time.</li><li> <strong>  Secret boards &ndash; learn to use them. </strong>  I was visiting a financial professional&rsquo;s Pinterest profile where they had boards about small business, motivational quotes and long-term care insurance. Not too shabby right? Except, they went into the &ldquo;Creep Zone&rdquo; when they also had boards titled exotic, her fantasy and dream girls.  <u>  <a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/articles/all-about-boards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pinterest has a feature called, &ldquo;Secret Boards&rdquo;  </a> </u>  &ndash; use them! You can pin without your followers seeing. For example, I have a secret board for my New Years Resolutions where I keep all the articles I want to review on getting my house in order, losing weight and cocktails I want to make by the pool this year. I then move pins from my secret boards to my open boards. <br/>  </li><p> Pinterest can be a &ldquo;pinteresting&rdquo; platform to use in 2016; make sure you do it right though!

You can only manage what you do with your time. <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  #1 - DECIDE WHO'S IN CHARGE </strong></p><p> One of the first things I do with a new client is help her to free more time. <br/> Always, always we start the same way: with a decision. <br/> <br/> Yes, you need to decide that you are in charge of your time-- not your phone, iPad or laptop. <br/> <br/> If I don&rsquo;t start by empowering the entrepreneur or business leader to take back their time, nothing will change. They won&rsquo;t have time for me, our meetings, or any homework assigned to them. We don&rsquo;t even get into time tips, tools and techniques until they get how important it is to own their time.</p><p> If you are like the 79% of 29-44 year olds that look at your phone, email, etc. before getting out of bed you are already handicapped for the day. The device has you and you are no longer in control. Think about it: there is never a quick check. One message leads your to Facebook, from there you are commenting, back to email and start responding. These diversions get you off on the wrong foot. They start your day by reacting vs planning. Now you are late and no planning gets done.</p><p> <strong>  #2 - BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND </strong></p><p> Imagine: You are pouring yourself a really nice glass of Cab at 7:30PM reflecting on the great  day you just had&hellip;.what happened? How was it a great day? What did you accomplish?  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Think%20about%20how%20you%20want%20to%20end%20the%20day%20at%20the%20start.&amp;url=http://www.katalystagency.com/blog/2015/12/1/time-money-6-quick-shifts-to-get-more&amp;via=karinbellantoni\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Think about how you want to end the day at the start  </u>  . </a>  This ensures that you think about the highest priorities. Visualize and walk yourself through the day. As you do this, think of the obstacles that could come your way and quickly decide how you would handle them.</p><p> <strong>  #3 - BE EARLY </strong></p><p> A client who was always late who lived in Washington Heights, way uptown. She had an extremely long commute and a demanding job and a frenetic energy. She wasted almost an hour every morning reacting to social media and email. She was always late for work and harried when she got there. She was losing confidence in morning meetings as she came in just in time for them and was typically out of breath. She planned to be at the office early--at least an hour before the meeting. We switched things around and she started her day with a 15 minute meditation and listing her priorities. On the subway she would enter all her priorities into her calendar and when she got to the office her boss could see her calendar and how organized she was for the day. When she arrived at the office she hit her email, since she was at her desk and feeling efficient, she didn&rsquo;t need to spend time answering every email in detail. Her reward was that for 15 minutes before the morning meeting started she could get on social media and be in the meeting room calm, relaxed, and waiting for the others.  <br/> <br/> She who is at the meeting early, calm, and relaxed...the other party rushing in with a story about the subway--guess who is in the power seat at the start of the meeting. <br/>   <br/> <strong>  # 4 - FOCUS ON INCOME </strong></p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=There%20are%20only%20two%20kinds%20of%20activities:%20those%20that%20are%20income%20producing%20and%20those%20that%20are%20not.&amp;url=http://www.katalystagency.com/blog/2015/12/1/time-money-6-quick-shifts-to-get-more&amp;via=karinbellantoni\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   There are only two kinds of activities: those that are income producing and those that are not  </u>  . </a>  Entrepreneurs tend to want to get things cleaned up all by themselves. Ha! That almost never happens. What will help you get things cleaned up is the assistant you can hire while you do those things that you do best that bring in more income. Makes sense, doesn&rsquo;t it? <br/>   <br/> Use the 50-50 rule. Make a list of all your activities. Put an &ldquo;I&rdquo; next to the ones that generate income. That could be sending an invoice out or asking for referrals to new business or calling some dormant clients to remind them that you care. When you prioritize your list make sure you are splitting the time between the items you marked with an \"I\" and the others. <br/> <br/> Some founders fall in love with developing their business; it is dangerous to spend more than 50% of your time there. Lights, camera action...get out from behind the director&rsquo;s chair! <br/>   <br/> <strong>  #5 - THE MONDAY MORNING DATE WITH YOURSELF </strong></p><p> Many years ago I started to love Mondays. Yes, you read that right! I owe it all to my Monday morning breakfast meeting with myself. Each Monday I get up earlier and start my day by 7:30am. I take myself to my favorite breakfast place and until 9am, I am &ldquo;ON&rdquo; my business vs. &ldquo;IN&rdquo; my business. I organize and plan my week, carefully prioritizing what gets to go on my calendar. That brings me to &hellip;. <br/>   <br/> <strong>  #6 - SCHEDULE EVERYTHING </strong></p><p> The calendar is a  critical business tool that not only makes you look professional but makes it pretty tough for you to miss a meeting. I use them for all my social activities, too. I even have a client that uses them for scheduling her family events and gaining commitment from her kids! In Gmail and Outlook you can even color code your activities to use to audit your time plans. Getting yourself electronic for your calendar is a must. <br/> <br/> It shocks me how many people of all ages and backgrounds still don&rsquo;t use an electronic calendar.</p><p> Here are some helpful e-calendar videos from YouTube: <br/>   <br/> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2kDxyVtBo8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   For Google Calendar  </u>    </a> - This is worth the 37 minute investment is great for Google calendar rookies or even intermediate users. </p><p> <u>  For iCal / Apple Calendar </u>  - Gives a good overview as to how iCal (now just called Calendar) can sync with your other Apple apps like Mail and iMessages.</p><p> <u>  Synching Google Calendar with Apple Calendar </u></p><p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwRTfTlC-hg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sunrise Calendar  </u>    </a> - My content coach swears by it. Syncs with all of your favorite productivity and social accounts for desktop, iPad, and mobile. Great video by Steve Dotto whose other videos are great for discovering many other productivity applications.</p><p> Make time by putting in your calendar! If you don&rsquo;t get to it--don&rsquo;t beat yourself up. Just reschedule. Move it to a time that day that does work. </p><p> Above all remember it is your time and you won&rsquo;t get it back. Make it work for you first. Your boss, family, and friends will thank you. </p><p> What is your biggest time thief?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-05 20:58:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-05 20:58:24.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_CB95oKC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/time-money-6-quick-shifts-to-get-more/\", \"post_id\": \"8418\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-05 20:58:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-05 20:58:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"time-money-6-quick-shifts-to-get-more\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8417\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3967\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Time-and-Money-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"777\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452110400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Frequently the requests are found to be annoying and inconvenient. Due to the time consumption they may also affect the bottom line. So the request is automatically met with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Should this be your typical reply, then it&rsquo;s time to reconsider future action in this regard.  On occasion, hiring managers will make very time consuming requests to test whether you will be a dedicated employee.</p><p> Special requests lead to deeper understanding when you take the time to listen.</p><h3> Charles&rsquo; Story <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;Charles&rdquo; is a project manager for a well-known home building company. Today, he relayed that he will grant his client a special request. The client was concerned about the current usage of today&rsquo;s tiny tiles that were slated for her condo under construction.</p><p> Humor used appropriately often makes the point.   The client joked that looking at the tile, she might get dizzy, black out and break a bone. It became apparent that the statement wasn&rsquo;t entirely a joke. Charles got the messsage. He asked the developer permission and was granted the change of tile on behalf of the client.</p><p> Charles said he felt especially good with the one sentence the client sent:  &ldquo;Your gift is enormous as we will be admiring the larger tile each day for many years to come.&rdquo;</p><h3> Result <br/>  </h3><p> Charles contributed to the company reputation plus built a solid personal brand by going the extra mile for his client. He and his team are sure to enjoy testimonials and referrals. The extra effort he went to will work for years on his behalf.</p><p>  </p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> Sales taught me to listen patiently to different perspectives on the same subject. Instead of instantly replying  &ldquo;no&rdquo; , I would ask what motivated the request. By hearing my prospective clients&rsquo; view and striving to understand it better, the trust and relationship built between us. Accordingly, the sales flowed in.</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> Consider last year&rsquo;s work and if you actually did ignore a request or two. Did you lose the business because of it? That&rsquo;s usually the case. The reason is, these requests are tests to see what customer service will be like after the sale. Not delivering as indicated produces an automatic loss, most of the time.</p><p> This year resolve to get the entire story as to why the request is being made.

Here they are:</p><h3> 1. More mutual fund firms will offer ETFs</h3><p> <br/> The ETF market is quickly growing its assets under management. And we&rsquo;ll place bets that investment firms and the money management arms of the banks are going to expand or start their ETF product shelf in 2016. Also, we expect to see a growing number of managed solutions that incorporate ETFs in order to offer competitive fees.</p><h3> 2. Robo-advisors will capture more assets</h3><p> <br/> We think robo-advisors are going to find successes in 2016. We also think, however, that robo-advisors will experience some growing pains early on, mostly as a result of highly unpredictable markets. There&rsquo;s a good chance that all of the Big 5 banks will start, acquire or form strong ties with robo-advisors by the end of the 2016.</p><h3> 3. Regulators will get serious about considering fiduciary duty for advisors</h3><p> <br/> As CRM2 winds down, we expect regulators to amp up their discussions about whether or not advisors will be held to a standard of fiduciary duty. We don&rsquo;t expect any implementation of this standard for years, if not decades.</p><h3> 4. Big U.S. investment firms will seek greater exposure to Canada</h3><p> <br/> Canada may not be the biggest market in the world but we seem to love mutual funds. We expect U.S. firms to take an ever-growing interest in Canadian investors. We expect to see partnerships between U.S. and Canadian firms, as well as the possibility of U.S. companies setting up shop north of the border.</p><h3> 5. Low resource prices will negatively affect investors right through 2016</h3><p> <br/> This may be obvious but we think it&rsquo;s worth noting. The supply of oil production right now far exceeds demand and Canadian energy companies are going to suffer. So are investors who have a lot of exposure to this sector.</p><h3> 6. Revving up for CRM2</h3><p> <br/> Everyone in the financial services industry &ndash; manufacturers, dealerships, advisors and investors &ndash; will be talking about CRM2, especially the new line items on statements.</p><p> There may not be any big surprizes on this list but these trends will dramatically shape the industry &ndash; and the projects that financial services marketers work on &ndash; for years to come.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 16:57:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 16:57:09.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Eql5HI1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-key-financial-services-trends-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8422\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 16:57:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 16:57:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-key-financial-services-trends-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8421\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3969\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Six-Key-Financial-Services-Trends-in-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"351\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452175200,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}

Under these circumstances, your marriage doesn't stand a chance.</p><p> Some of the red flags include: daydreaming about this person, sharing emotional and intimate information about your marriage, you look forward to seeing him or her, and they become the first person you want to share information with.

{"original_id":3833,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Personalized Social Media: More Social Less Media","link":"personalized-social-media-more-social-less-media","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I logged into Facebook to send a note to my mother the other day, when I spotted a notification from one of my favorite online (Facebook only) clothing companies, Paisley &amp; Taylor. Her message let me know that the velvet shirt dress I wanted last month was back in and she thought I should get the medium because of the way these fit. After ordering that dress and a few other things, I finally got around to sending my mom that message.</p><h3> While I don&rsquo;t log into Facebook in hopes of having brands contact me or try to sell me something, those who have taken the time to get to know me, my needs, and my likes, are exempt.</h3><p> <br/> When a business does social right, it feels personal. It feels like talking with a friend. It doesn&rsquo;t feel salesy or spammy. This type of relationship may not always be possible with every brand or with each follower of your brand, but it is more possible today on social media channels than ever before. <br/>  </p><p> When we all first flocked to social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even LinkedIn, the focus was on acquisition. Companies were buying likes, buying followers and putting LION (LinkedIn Open Networker) in their LinkedIn profile to attract anyone and everyone. The problem with all of this random acquisition is when a brand then wanted to try and convert fans into paying customers or spend money promoting posts or advertising to their fans and followers, they were then having to spend money to reach these crowds of random people who will most likely never make a purchase. Now many are wishing they had a small group of targeted people who were more likely to buy from them. It&rsquo;s like standing on a corner in New York City trying to sell something with everyone passing by ignoring you, versus a small town. We need to take a more personalized social media approach for greater conversions.</p><p> When you are connected to fewer people, you can have real conversations and get to know your fan base, get input from them, reward them with early release promotions and of course sell to them much easier than trying to get people to buy from your promotional blasts that are going out to the masses. Getting to know your fans allows you to send them blog posts or articles you know they would find helpful. It allows you to customize your services to them.</p><h3> So what do you do if you have already amassed a large following?</h3><p> <br/> You can start injecting more social into your media. Spend time replying to things your fans are saying. Send a &ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo; message to a few people each day as if you were walking through the streets of Twitter town greeting them. Start conversations, join conversations, ask another question to further a conversation. Find those who are truly your target market and build relationships online through regular communication. And little by little, start to unfollow those that are dead weight.</p><h3> The part most companies just don&rsquo;t get, is the SOCIAL part. The media part is easy.</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve been pushing our messages out through different media channels since the beginning of time, but this social stuff&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s just foreign to many. It really is a blend of sales, customer service, and marketing skills, and when done right, it is winning over, not just more customers, but more advocates who will become a sales team for your brand.</p><p> Get out and practice being social on your social media channels. Take some time to get to know who you are connected with and what they are talking about. Study your analytics and insights on each of your social channels to see who is connecting with you each week. If they are joining organically, you should be able to learn a lot from them. Use hashtags and keyword searches to see who is talking about your industry, your products or services and then join in the conversations without trying to sell anything. Let the relationships form first. If your profile is filled out, people will come and learn more about you.</p><p> Make this the year you get more personal&ndash; more intimate with your social community and watch your conversion rates grow!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 19:52:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 19:52:58.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_sWUIoms.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/personalized-social-media-more-social-less-media/\", \"post_id\": \"8426\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 19:52:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 19:52:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"personalized-social-media-more-social-less-media\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8425\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3972\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Personalized-Social-Media-More-Social-Less-Media.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"407\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452346200,"author_id":185,"chart_url":""}

First, all able-bodied Finnish males must perform military service, and from 1982 to 2011, the Finnish Armed Forces subjected these men to a battery of psychological tests which resulted in an intelligence score, or I.Q.</p><p> Second, up until 2006 Finland had a wealth tax which required all citizens to report their investment portfolios to the government. As a result, the authors of the study were able to compare the investing habits of Finnish males with their intelligence scores. The opportunity to perform this analysis is remarkable because similar data sets simply do not exist in other countries.</p><p> Using similar data in a separate paper, Greenblatt and Keloharju teamed with Seppo Ikaheimo of Aalto University and Samuli Knupfer of London Business School to look at the influence intelligence had on investors&rsquo; mutual fund choices. The authors found high-I.Q. investors were less likely to own balanced funds, actively-managed funds and funds sold by brokers, all of which tend to charge higher fees. High-I.Q. investors, the authors concluded, were indeed smarter about their fund choices&mdash;they favored low-cost and passively-managed (index) funds.</p><p> Perhaps what&rsquo;s most interesting about these papers is what they don&rsquo;t conclude. <strong>  The authors never suggest smart investors have some edge in picking stocks or timing the market&mdash;two activities often seen as the special domain of the most intelligent among us. </strong></p><p> No, what the studies clearly conclude is that smart investors simply follow a few of the most basic rules of successful investing: Favor stocks for long-term growth, diversify, and minimize fund expenses whenever possible.</p><p> These timeless principles form the foundation of Vista&rsquo;s approach, and can be used by investors all around the world, no matter their level of intelligence.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 20:13:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 20:13:09.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_stf4XEM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-people-with-high-i-q-scores-better-investors/\", \"post_id\": \"8428\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 20:13:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 20:13:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-people-with-high-i-q-scores-better-investors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8427\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3973\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/People-with-Higher-IQs-are-Better-Investors-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"997\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452168900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Examples of quests highlighted in the book include: travel to every country in the world; take, edit, and publish one million photos; read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica in one year; produce the world&rsquo;s largest symphony performance; and more.

While certainly a bit unusual in parts, I love the simple decision-making power in the question: &ldquo;Does it spark joy?&rdquo; I have actually implemented her methodology not only with physical stuff in my office and home, but also with activities, opportunities, even food choices.

The only area of decreasing spend was on desktops. Interestingly most US bank CIOs will be spending more on branch technologies this year. </strong> In a full analysis of the research  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/banks-to-spend-more-on-tech-in-2016-especially-security-1077200-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American Banker  </a> </u>  reports:</p><p> In a difficult environment for revenue growth, banks looking to control costs are by and large leaving technology budgets alone. Instead, driven by the need to secure computer systems, develop analytic capabilities and enhance customer-facing platforms, most banks are planning substantial increases in spending across a wide spectrum of technology in 2016, according to chief information officers.</p><p> Anticipated increases in spending on security are particularly intense, with most executives forecasting jumps in budget allocations of at least 10%. By contrast, banks are finding little to cut in the technology arena, with desktops one of just two categories where more CIOs forecast decreases than increases in spending next year.</p><p> The findings are based on an online poll of 50 bank chief information officers and senior technology executives fielded by SourceMedia's research unit. Since technology spending is not typically disclosed to the public in financial reports, the survey provides a unique window into the industry's priorities and budget plans. Respondents came from banks of all sizes, and the vast majority have long tenures in the information technology world.</p><p> Besides security, most bank CIOs to spend more next year on data analytics and mobile banking. <strong>  Between 40% and 50% of executives also expect increases in budgets for compliance, online banking, \"bring-your-own-device\" management &mdash; to accommodate hardware employees own &mdash; and payment software. </strong></p><p> About 28% of CIOs forecast decreases in spending on desktops next year. That figure outweighs the 12% of CIOs who forecast increased spending on desktops. About 18% predicted decreased spending on servers, but a larger 22% forecast increased spending on servers. Besides desktops, the only category where more CIOs forecast spending declines than increases is internal investment management technology.</p><p> No CIOs anticipate spending less on security, and percentages forecasting decreased spending in most of the categories considered here were negligible, ranging from 2% to about 6%.</p><p> About 13% expect to cut back on branch technology, but those CIOs were far outnumbered by the 35% who expect increased spending on branch technology. The number of branches across the country has been dropping sharply since 2009 as online and mobile channels displace traditional teller interactions, but branches themselves are becoming more technology intensive as banks install ever-more sophisticated automatic teller machines and rethink branch staffing, equipment and design in ways that contribute to the trend.</p><p> Among respondents anticipating higher spending on branch technology, nearly a third forecast budget increases of 20% or more, showing that a significant segment of the industry is planning major branch upgrades. A comparable fraction of executives anticipating increases in analytics spending forecast a jump of a similar magnitude in that category. <br/> <br/> The scale of growth in security spending appears particularly large, however. A plurality of those anticipating higher security spending forecast increases in the range of 10% to 19% next year, and nearly 40% forecast increases ranging from 20% to a doubling in spending.</p><p> While the importance of investing in technology is borne out by banks' budget plans, CIOs report feeling the pinch of spending constraints. Asked to identify their top five challenges, 42% named \"managing tight budgets.\" Only \"keeping up with security issues\" was named by a larger proportion, 60%.</p><p> Budget plans also align with areas that CIOs separately say are the subject of intensifying focus. As a group, executives reported pushing customer-facing technology, security and supporting \"big data\" and analytics to the top of their priorities. <br/> <br/> In open-ended responses, CIOs said the recent string of high-profile data breaches, the \"high cost of failure\" &mdash; including damage to reputations &mdash; and regulatory scrutiny were driving attention and spending on security. One said that the rise in digital banking is increasing susceptibility to attacks, and that \"data is money and it matters to consumers\".</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 20:41:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 20:41:42.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_StnYvkQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/where-will-banks-invest-in-technology-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8436\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 20:41:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 20:41:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"where-will-banks-invest-in-technology-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8435\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3977\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bank-Investment-2016-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"483\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452159900,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3838,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Top 5 Retirement Planning Tips for Singles","link":"top-5-retirement-planning-tips-for-singles","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you&rsquo;re a single professional, you have a distinct disadvantage when it comes to saving for retirement. The challenge? Single life can sometimes lead to spending rather than saving. As a result, it can take some time to dig out of money mistakes you made when you were young and single&mdash;or even not-so-young and single. No matter your age or how many assets you&rsquo;ve saved to date, here are some great ways to be sure you stay on track toward your retirement goals:</p><h3> 1. Live within your means. </h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;re single, having a paycheck with few obligations can feel great. Data shows that, as a group, singles tend to spend more on eating out, entertainment, and extras like clothes, salon services, and more. In general, when you don&rsquo;t have a spouse or family adding to your expenses, it&rsquo;s easier to feel like you have more to spend than you really do. The answer: Make a budget, stick to it, and review it twice a year. And when that raise comes, readjust your savings goals first&mdash;before you readjust your spending habits.</p><h3> 2. Save. Save. </h3><p> <br/> You may be the exception, but most singles tend to save less than their married friends. Without the added responsibilities, the pressure just isn&rsquo;t there. The best approach to making sure you build your assets over time is to set up automatic savings. Enroll at the maximum level in your company-sponsored retirement plan, but don&rsquo;t stop there. Set up systematic deductions that go straight to your cash savings and short-duration bond funds for short-term needs, as well as into a mid-term vehicle like a mutual or institutional fund for money you might need in 5-10 years. In 20 years, you&rsquo;ll be shocked at how much you&rsquo;ve socked away.</p><h3> 3. Protect your biggest asset: your ability to earn an income. </h3><p> <br/> As a single person, you don&rsquo;t even have the illusion that you can rely on someone else for support if something happens to you.  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_insurance\" target=\"_blank\">   Disability insurance (DI)  </a> </u>  is a must, and the cost is minimal.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/convertible-insurance-policy.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Convertible term life insurance  </a> </u>  gives you the cost benefit of term insurance with the option to convert to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholelife.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   whole life  </a> </u>  if your health takes a bad turn. No one who has ever had a problem has said, &ldquo;I spent too much on insurance.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Evaluate&mdash;and re-evaluate&mdash;your debt. </h3><p> <br/> While younger singles have less debt than other groups, much of that debt is in student loans that you might assume (often wrongly) is &ldquo;cheap debt.&rdquo; Whether you have student loans, credit card debt, or anything else, it&rsquo;s wise to shop around to see if you can consolidate your debt and get a lower rate. Check local credit unions and online banks that often offer lower rates.</p><h3> 5. Keep credit card debt to a minimum. </h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a given for anyone, but singles need to be wary of overspending on luxuries. And while singles tend to be better about credit cards than their married friends&mdash;even those without kids&mdash;be sure to maintain a low or no balance. </p><p> Saving for retirement is a challenge for everyone, not just singles. Putting a plan in place today can help set you on a path toward a more secure financial future and give you a greater level of confidence knowing that when that paycheck does eventually come to a halt, you have a solid retirement savings at the ready to replace your monthly income and keep your cash flowing.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 20:42:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 20:42:52.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_wlBd5qK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/top-5-retirement-planning-tips-for-singles/\", \"post_id\": \"8438\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 20:42:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 20:42:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"top-5-retirement-planning-tips-for-singles\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8437\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3978\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Top-5-Retirement-Planning-Tips-for-Singles.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"777\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452186000,"author_id":183,"chart_url":""}

He was excited to share a customer service story with me. He prefaced it by saying it may not sound like a big deal, but after he told me what happened, I told him that while it may not be a big deal, it was still extremely important and worth sharing.</p><p> Gary was at a restaurant and almost finished with his meal. He had set his fork and knife down. The server noticed he had stopped eating, yet there was still a little food left on the plate. He asked Gary, &ldquo;Are you continuing to enjoy your meal?&rdquo; Gary acknowledge with a simple, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and the server came back later, after Gary had obviously finished, and took his plate.</p><p> What impressed Gary was not that the server was polite and obviously very good at his job. It was the server&rsquo;s question. The actual words he used, <strong>  &ldquo;Are you continuing to enjoy your meal?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> What made that question stand out was what happened after talking to Gary when I went to dinner with my wife. Toward the end of the meal the server came over and asked, <strong>  &ldquo;You still working on that?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> I never really thought about that question before &ndash; until that night. I replayed the conversation Gary and I had earlier that day. I contrasted the two servers&rsquo; questions. Both servers&rsquo; intentions were the same, to take care of us. It&rsquo;s just the language they used. One was polite &ndash; even classy and sophisticated. The other, in comparison, was a little &ldquo;raw.&rdquo;</p><p> Again, I&rsquo;d never thought much about this before. Servers have asked questions such as, &ldquo;Can I take your plate?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are you finished?&rdquo; They are just doing their job. Even, &ldquo;Are you done with that?&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t bad. Until you compare it to the classiness of, &ldquo;Are you continuing to enjoy your meal?&rdquo;</p><p> Let me share another example. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve walked into a retail store and a salesperson came up to you and with a friendly smile, welcomed you and asked, &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p> Compare that with what my friends at Ace Hardware train their people to say as a greeting. Again, with a friendly smile and warm greeting, the salesperson asks, &ldquo;What can I help you find today?&rdquo;</p><p> Totally different ways to ask the same question, even though you may get the same answer.

In the  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/never-compromise-the-consistency-of-the-customer-experience/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   restaurant  </a> </u> , it is classier.

Training and  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/5-reasons-companies-fail-customer-service/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reinforcement  </a> </u> .

Here&rsquo;s how I distinguish between them:</p><p> <strong>  Vision is the &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Your Vision statement answers the question, &ldquo;What significant difference does our company intend to make in the world? In what way will the world be changed for the better by our completing our Mission?</p><p> Think of your Vision statement as a succinct and powerful intention. A good Vision statement is short and memorable&mdash;often just a few words or a single sentence&mdash;but it stretches the imagination.</p><p> Example: At a time when there were virtually no personal computers in the world, Steve Jobs articulated his compelling vision of the future in nine words:  &ldquo;A computer on every desk and in every home.&rdquo;  </p><p> At its best, a company Vision is a compelling picture of a new reality&mdash;a desired future state. It&rsquo;s something exciting that is currently out of reach, and it should inspire and motivate your people to close the gap.</p><p> <strong>  Mission is the &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> A company&rsquo;s Mission statement answers the practical question, &ldquo;Why do we exist as a business?&rdquo; It describes your special role or specific niche in the market place.</p><p> I know that some companies think of their Vision and Mission as one and the same, but I like to distinguish them this way:</p><p> At its best, a company Mission statement is typically more left-brained and &ldquo;business-like&rdquo; than the Vision statement. Think of your Mission statement as &ldquo;feet on the ground&rdquo; and your Vision statement as &ldquo;eyes on the stars.&rdquo;</p><p> In a way, your Mission Statement is a miniature 2-5 sentence business plan&mdash;something practical and portable that will quickly and clearly describe your business, not only to your clients and your people, but to the bank.</p><p> Another way to look at it: If you execute your Mission, you will eventually achieve your Vision.</p><p> <u>  Example: </u>  Here is a nice, compact Mission Statement crafted by Sun Microsystems:  &ldquo;Our Mission is to assist and empower our clients to succeed in their enterprise or marketplace. We do this by creating world-class products and solutions that enable our clients to migrate easily&mdash;and navigate freely&mdash;in the new world of open integrated computing.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Values are the &ldquo;How?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> A company&rsquo;s Core Values answer the question, &ldquo;How do we intend to treat each other and our customers on the way to achieving our Vision and Mission?&rdquo;</p><p> Values are personal choices you make about the qualities that are most important to you, your people and your brand. And, like a compass, they should guide your every action and decision.</p><p> I have found that it&rsquo;s a good idea to shoot for 4-6 Core Values. Yes, you will have other Values beyond those, but these 4-6 should comprise your uppermost values and priorities. Here, for example, are the five Core Values that describe and guide the corporate culture and marketing of Montana&rsquo;s Moonlight Basin ski resort:  Montana-style Hospitality. Honesty. Openness. Family. Community Enrichment.</p><p> Taken together, your Core Values should describe your special &ldquo;style&rdquo; and &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; of doing business. They should resonate in your advertising, your brand, your company communications and culture.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 20:51:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 20:51:58.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_uKWuSvw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/knowing-the-difference-between-a-companys-vision-mission-and-values/\", \"post_id\": \"8441\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 20:51:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 20:51:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"knowing-the-difference-between-a-companys-vision-mission-and-values\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8442\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3980\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Knowing-the-Difference-Between-a-Company\\u2019s-Vision-Mission-and-Values.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"941\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452178800,"author_id":325,"chart_url":""}

According to Annalect, a marketing data agency, the 78 million boomers born between 1946 and 1964 are the largest U.S. consumer demographic, with a total spending power of $12 trillion worldwide.</p><p> Yet marketers love Millennials: who they are, what they want, how they buy, and how to talk with them.</p><p> Many Registered Investment Advisors and other modern financial advisors have built thriving practices by targeting the Millennial generation (those born between about 1980 to about 2004; or by speaking to Generation X (those generally born between 1965 to 1979).</p><h3> Boomers Have the Buying Power <br/>  </h3><p> But who has the buying power? Hint: it's the Boomers. The many kiddos who often control advertising and marketing dollars directed only 10% of their total spend to the boomer generation&hellip;yet boomers controlled more 83% of all consumer spending in 2014, according to a study by the Live Well Collaborative, a research think tank partnership of Procter &amp; Gamble and academia.</p><p> So while millennials might make the headlines, most financial advisors might make the most assets under management by working with the &ldquo;Most Valuable Generation.&rdquo;</p><p> Ignore the Boomers at your peril. A few statistics:</p><p> <strong>  1. Boomers Control the Money. </strong>  According to Gallup, the baby boom generation controlled more than 80% of all financial assets. On average, they held more than $100,000 in investments and savings.</p><p> <strong>  2. Boomers May Spend More than Others. </strong> Over the next 20 years, spending by people 50+ is expected to increase by 58% to $4.74 trillion, while spending by Americans aged 25- 50 will grow by only 24%. (Source: Pew/American Life Project.)</p><p> <strong>  3. Boomers Are Persuadable. </strong>  People born between 1946 and 1964 are not necessarily set in their ways. Boomer brand loyalty is about the same other generations, according to AARP. &ldquo;Baby boomers,&rdquo; according to CrowdTwist,  &ldquo;Are more likely to demonstrate loyalty to brands that offer exceptional customer service, offer a true value proposition, and prioritize simplicity.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  4. Boomers Have Scale.  </strong> By 2015, those aged 50 and older will represent 45% of the U.S. population, according to AARP. By 2050, there will be 161 million 50+ consumers - a 63% increase over 2010.</p><p> <strong>  5. Boomers are the Majority. </strong>  50% of the U.S. population will be over the age of 50 by 2017. (Source: Annalect). They are the fastest growing demographic, said Pew Research.</p><p> <strong>  6. Boomers Have Higher Net Worth. </strong> Despite making up approximately one-quarter of the U.S. population, Boomers comprised 35% of all net worth. (Source: Congressional Budget Office.)</p><p> <strong>  7. Boomers Have the Disposable Income. </strong>  People over 50 have $2.4 trillion in annual income in the U.S., which comprised up 80% of all disposable income. (Source: Consumer Expenditure Survey.)</p><p> <strong>  8. Boomers Will be Inheriting. </strong> There&rsquo;s money in motion: baby boomers stand to inherit $15 trillion in the next 20 years from the Greatest Generation. (Source: AARP.) And as boomers retire, their children stand to inherit money; will their inherit their financial advisors, too?</p><p> <strong>  9. Boomers are Online. </strong>  The 50-plus cohort spent more time online, according to Pew Research, than millennials: 51% of baby boomers spend 15 hours per week online. Only 41% of millennials spend the same amount of time online.</p><p> <strong>  10. Boomers Have Spending Power.  </strong> The worldwide spending power of buyers over 60 should surpass $15 trillion by 2020, nearly twice the $8 trillion in 2010.</p><p> <strong>  11. Boomers Spend Online.  </strong> The 50-plussers spent $7 billion per year online - $400 million more online last year than the youngins&rsquo;. (Source: Annalect.)</p><p> <strong>  12. Boomers Connect Online. </strong>  83% went online to search for information, according to Pew.</p><p> <strong>  13. Boomers Buy Smartphones and Tablets. </strong> Also according to Pew, 38% owned tablets, and 36% owned a smartphone as of 2015.</p><p> <strong>  14. Boomers are Social. </strong> 82% of baby boomers belong to at least once social networking site. (Source: AARP.)</p><p> <strong>  15. Boomers are Smart.  </strong> 50% of adults age 50+ have used their smartphone to access social networking sites. (AARP, 2013).</p><p> <strong>  16. Boomers Start Businesses. </strong> Baby boomers started 14% of new business in 1996, said AARP, but 24% of new businesses as of 2014. Among adults age 18 and older who don't currently own a business, boomers were twice as likely as millennials to plan to start a business in the next year.</p> <p> <img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/5a3fd2_92f01fc783384fff81a59ff2258333f7.png/v1/fit/w_630,h_332,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/5a3fd2_92f01fc783384fff81a59ff2258333f7.png\"/></p><h3> <br/> The Downside of Boom <br/>  </h3><p> While many Boomers have high incomes, not all have significant retirement income. This cohort may benefit from the financial education RIAs and forward-thinking financial advisors may provide.</p><p> <strong>  17. Not all Boomers are Well Off. </strong>  1% of boomers control about one-third of the generation's assets; the richest 10% own more than two-thirds, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p> <strong>  18. Boomers May Rely Too Much on Social Security. </strong>  According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies (TCRS), 36% of boomers felt that Social Security would be their primary income source in retirement. (With retirement accounts and savings accounts at 34%, and company-funded pensions at 12%.)</p><p> <strong>  19. Boomers Have No Savings. </strong>  About 40% of the boomer generation have no retirement savings at all. Source: Insured Retirement Institute.</p><p> <strong>  20. Boomers Don&rsquo;t Fund Their 401k. </strong> From the TCRS study: 19% who could have invested in a company sponsored 401(k) or other retirement plan declined to do so.</p><p> <strong>  21. Boomers are on Track to Meet Their Retirement Needs. </strong> Despite the dour sounding news, more than half of the not-already retired Boomers were successfully on the way to funding their retirement, according to The Employee Benefit Research Institute. For those working and not quite there yet, the average extra required was more than $140,000 for couples, and approximately $100,000 for single females.</p><h3> A Generation, Not A Monolith <br/>  </h3><p> As you build out your RIA or financial advisor practice, catering to one generation over another may be a sound approach. Yet as each generation may have a general persona, every generation has niches and communities within. Boomer lawyers, boomer dentists, boomer military, boomer executives, boomer stereo aficionados: advisors have built and will continue to build successful long-term practices targeted to a specific persona within a specific age group.</p><p> One thing is certain, however, and that&rsquo;s the need to build the book of business, whether from client referrals, professional referrals or from new lead generation.</p>  <p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 21:23:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 21:23:43.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_rUpbp2C.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/21-reasons-why-rias-should-not-ignore-the-baby-boom-generation/\", \"post_id\": \"8446\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 21:23:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 21:23:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"21-reasons-why-rias-should-not-ignore-the-baby-boom-generation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8445\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3982\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21-Reasons-Why-RIAs-Should-Not-Ignore-the-Baby-Boom-Generation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1485\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452218400,"author_id":180,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3843,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Understand Client Psychology aka What Makes Them Tick","link":"understand-client-psychology-aka-what-makes-them-tick","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Most of the most successful advisors I&rsquo;ve met over the past 25 years make it a point to understand the mindset of their clients and prospects before they ever talk about investments. They know it&rsquo;s important to understand what experiences they have had in the past, any fears they have about investing and what their future looks like in their mind. The best way to learn more about them is to ask specific questions and then pay attention to the details. Here are seven questions recommended by the best financial advisors I know.</p><li> <strong>  How was money handled by your parents when you were growing up? </strong> This is a big question because you&rsquo;ll quickly get a glimpse of the lessons they learned and what their attitude is about investing today. My financial advisor asked me this question in 1995 and learned plenty about me when I answered. I grew up very poor, learned the value of food stamps and food donated to our family by the local church and as a result, it taught me many valuable life lessons. Lesson number 1: I NEVER want to be poor again. But it also scarred me as an investor because I never wanted to be broke again as an adult. So my advisor learned that I wanted to increase the size of my portfolio but didn&rsquo;t want to take on too much risk because I feared losing all my money. When you ask a prospect or client that question, be ready to take plenty of notes. Fears run deep and this question will bring back many memories.</li><li> <strong>  If we were to meet three years from now and look back to today, what would have to happen in your portfolio and in our relationship for you to feel like this was a successful relationship?  </strong> This will help you manage expectations and learn exactly what they are expecting from you. Again, listen and take notes. IF your client told you they are conservative but expect their portfolio to double in three years, that&rsquo;s a red flag. That performance happened in 1999 but it&rsquo;s unlikely to happen again. Their reply will tell you what to expect and what you need to do to make this relationship a successful one for both of you.</li><li> <strong>  What do you visualize your retirement to look like? What will you be doing? Where will you be living and what does a typical day look like? </strong>  Visualization is a good exercise for both of you. It paints a vivid picture in the mind&rsquo;s eye and gives you something to look forward to. As an advisor, you&rsquo;ll have a clear picture of your responsibility but you&rsquo;ll also have a better understanding of your client&rsquo;s attitude, dreams, hopes and expectations.</li><li> <strong>  What lessons have you taught your children and/or grandchildren about money? </strong>  Many of us learn lessons over the years. Sometimes we learn the hard way and others we learn from observing others. My three children know how poor I was and they&rsquo;ve seen my tiny childhood home. It inspired them to work hard and save some of their money. I will admit that I spoiled them because I wanted to give them all the things I didn&rsquo;t have when I was a kid. It was a mistake but I had the best of intentions. Fortunately, they still worked and saved and learned from my lessons. One of the best lessons I learned from my father is one I adhere to today. If you can&rsquo;t afford it, then don&rsquo;t buy it until you can afford it. I also learned how valuable it is to &ldquo;help&rdquo; cover a portion of the cost for something your kids want. Offer to pay for half if they are willing to pay for half. This strategy works much better than paying for the entire purchase because now they have some skin in the game and the purchase is meaningful to them. That works well for cars, golf clubs, big ticket items and even college.</li><li> <strong>  What concerns or thoughts keep you awake at night? </strong>  If you want to understand your clients life on  a daily basis, this question will tell you plenty about them. One of the most common complaints about advisors is that they don&rsquo;t understand the most serious concerns and don&rsquo;t really know the client. Once you know this, it&rsquo;s up to you to address the concerns and find a solution to put them at ease if possible.</li><li> <strong>  What was the best investment you ever made? </strong>  This answer will give you more insight into their investing psychology but will also put a great big smile on their face. They love talking about the Home Run investment they made and how they celebrated. They will possibly talk about the nightmare investment also, and that helps you understand their mindset also.</li><li> <strong>  What else I should know about your past experiences or future goals that I may have missed?  </strong> This question will give them the opportunity to share anything else on their mind and something you may have missed during your talk. <br/>  </li><p> Asking questions and then listening (that&rsquo;s the important part of this exercise) creates trust. A main reason prospects decide  <strong>  NOT </strong>  to invest with a certain person is because they just don&rsquo;t trust them. No trust = no relationship ~ period!   This exercise ties into one of my more popular presentations on consultative selling. It leads to a higher level of trust very quickly. Be sure you ask these questions in a friendly tone that says, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get to know each other&rdquo;. This is NOT an interrogation with 50 questions. When you meet someone at a party, you both ask questions to get to know each other, see what you have in common and sometimes it develops into a new friendship. This works the same way with clients and prospects.

A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consumer-business/us-cb-2015-american-pantry-study.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Deloitte 2015 American Pantry Study  </a> </u>  found <strong>  &ldquo;three of four packaged goods categories have seen a decline in &lsquo;must have&rsquo; brand loyalty since 2011.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> The study identified four attributes currently most important to consumers. They are:</p><li> Healthy</li><li> Innovative</li><li> Convenient</li><li> Customized <br/>  </li><h3> Each attribute reflects a personal component, and each is open to broad definition.</h3><p> <br/> To build loyalty among consumers they seek to serve, companies must further understand what matters to them, and create meaningful brands, products and services that will spur these consumers&rsquo; purchases.</p><p> Purchasing store brands is one choice consumers made to save money, particularly in the &ldquo;Great Recession.&rdquo; Whether due to slow recovery, or now a long-term trend, many consumers remain value-conscious, use coupons regularly and bring lists to ensure they buy only what they need.</p><p> Per the Deloitte study, store brands are purchased for practical reasons, such as price, familiarity and availability. National brands are chosen for emotional reasons, such as love and trust.</p><p> So, the question national and store brands alike face is what they can do to gain loyalty from those not currently purchasing their brand.</p><h3> One Expert&rsquo;s Perspective</h3><p> <br/> Michael J. Silverstein, senior partner of Boston Consulting Group*, shares advice on emotionally connecting with consumers and making your brand essential in their lives. He states that their research shows 2% of customers &ndash; which he terms &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; &ndash; are personally responsible for 20% of sales. However, their enthusiastic &ldquo;evangelizing&rdquo; with friends and family means they account for 80% of total sales and 150% of profits.</p><p> <strong>  How to effectively focus on apostle customers to become an apostle brand? </strong></p><li> <strong>  Consumers don&rsquo;t always know what they want. </strong> The more unique and/or revolutionary your product(s) the more this is true. Show them!</li><li> <strong>  Consider Apple. </strong> Consumers never asked for anything like the iPhone. However, iPhone apostles consider their iPhones central to every day.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t spend your budget on attracting customers in general. </strong> Focus on those within your core group. Success with apostles will drive brand growth.</li><li> <strong>  Welcome customers&rsquo; anger. </strong> The greater the anger, the more you have to learn. Ignoring or shutting down complaints is a brand destroying formula. Listen. Then prepare to change.</li><li> <strong>  Focus on &ldquo;demand spaces&rdquo; &ndash; not just demographics. </strong> &ldquo;Demand spaces&rdquo; are occasions or emotional moments when people seek a product. These are real events people experience that may include drama, emotion and energy. &ldquo;Demand spaces&rdquo; are what drive buying patterns.</li><li> <strong>  For example, when PepsiCo figured out what makes a &ldquo;snacking moment&rdquo; for people that they were able to revitalize Lay&rsquo;s potato chips. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Design does matter. </strong> Take a fresh look at the physical look of your products.</li><li> <strong>  Employees create huge opportunities &ndash; or can ensure failure </strong> . Turn employees into &ldquo;disciples&rdquo; who will engage customers and tell your story with passion. Train them, develop them and pay them well. Protect them.</li><li> <strong>  Get virtual. </strong> Use your online presence to go way beyond selling. Consider virtual communications as opportunities to form real relationships. Your website, blogs and other social media can help strengthen trust and create real bonds with apostles.</li><li> <strong>  No tweaks. </strong> If you&rsquo;re going to make a change, make it a big, bold change. Incremental improvements are a waste. <br/>  </li><h3> Brands are fragile.</h3><p> <br/> Some brands that are greatly loved are also strongly disliked. No brand is stable. Change is a constant. Creating an apostle brand requires a very precise plan, but at its core is simple: &ldquo;understand what consumers really want, create stunning experiences and have an authentic relationship with them.&rdquo;</p><h3> <br/> Action Items: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Convene your leadership group. </strong> Define your core customers &ndash; those who are of greatest importance in terms of revenues, profitability, influence, early adopters, etc.</li><li> <strong>  Conduct an in-depth study to gain insight into personal views and emotional ties of these customers. </strong> Examine their relationship with their favorite brand or two.</li><li> <strong>  Evaluate your current employee status. </strong> Do you have the right employees &ndash; particularly those who are customer facing?

Start by ensuring these three essentials are in place.</p><h3> Tips to Help you Improve your Financial Health <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Make sure your Will is up to date. </strong> <br/> <br/> It is important that everyone have an up-to-date Will and one that is properly drafted by a professional. This is especially important if you have young children. If you do not have a Will and should pass away, provincial law will determine how your assets will be distributed and to whom.</p><p> If you have prepared a Will, remember to review it any time a life change occurs &ndash; if you get married or divorced, become a parent or grandparent, or when a loved one passes away. If you and your spouse separate, you should change your Will if you don&rsquo;t want your assets to pass to him or her on your death.</p><p> Finally, name someone you trust and who will be around to handle the settling of your estate &ndash; an &lsquo;Executor&rsquo;. This often is an adult child, sibling or a close family friend. <br/> I would also suggest setting up a Power of Attorney/Representation Agreement at the same time you are meeting with a professional to draft your Will. So if you are ever incapacitated, this will be someone you trust to act on your behalf.</p><p> <strong>  2. Review your insurance coverage to ensure you have adequate coverage. </strong></p><p> Just as you would protect your car or home from misfortune, you need to also protect your family should you pass away while they are still financially dependent upon you. How much insurance is considered adequate will vary according to each person&rsquo;s unique situation.</p><li> Do you have dependent children or grandchildren?</li><li> Are you the main &ldquo;bread winner&rdquo; for the family?</li><li> Do you have future costs, such as education or a spouse&rsquo;s retirement, you want to ensure are taken care of if you were not around? <br/>  </li><p> Generally, you need to have enough insurance to pay down the mortgage, any debts or outstanding bills and burial costs. It is then recommended that you have enough funds remaining to provide income for your family for the number of years you deem necessary.</p><p> In addition to life insurance, consider having adequate disability insurance in place. It is advised to have enough coverage to provide 60 to 70 per cent of your household&rsquo;s income.</p><p> <strong>  3. Set up an emergency fund. </strong></p><p> As the saying goes, &ldquo;Life happens when you&rsquo;re busy making other plans,&rdquo; and life tends to cost money. Having enough money put aside for such unexpected events can make the difference between staying afloat or sinking financially. One of the most important elements of your financial health is to ensure an emergency fund is in place &ndash; and sooner rather than later.</p><p> The general rule of thumb is to have between three and six months of your current living expenses set aside for emergency situations. However, this depends on many factors specific to each person&rsquo;s situation such as, how employable you are, whether or not you carry substantial debt, if you have adequate insurance, if you are a dual income household and whether you have children.</p><p> A Will, insurance and an emergency fund are three essentials for financial health that should be considered by everyone. If you find it a bit daunting to get the ball rolling, find a trusted  <a href=\"http://www.rhondasherwood.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   financial advisor  </u>    </a> who can help guide you in the process. An advisor should not only be able to provide guidance and recommendations unique to your individual situation, but they should also be able to put you in touch with trusted sources to prepare or update your Will or Power or Attorney.</p><p> Start 2016 off by looking after these three financial essentials.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-06 21:40:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-06 21:40:14.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_TCFoDyp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-improve-your-financial-health-this-year/\", \"post_id\": \"8452\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-06 21:40:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-06 21:40:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-improve-your-financial-health-this-year\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8451\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3985\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Improve-your-Financial-Health-This-Year-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"690\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452189600,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3846,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Hustler's Index of Daily Sales Goals","link":"the-hustlers-index-of-daily-sales-goals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Do your sales performance appraisals and discussions about sales process sound like the first 90 seconds of this clip?</p><p> If so, you're not alone - and to be fair, some sales leaders do thrive on gut instinct and shooting from the hip. They're also a dwindling minority. </p><p> In this day and age where widespread availability of sales analytics software is at our disposal, sales leaders have every reason to go the Billy Beane route in terms of performance management.</p><h3> <strong>  The Hustler's Index of Daily Sales Goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> The Hustler's Index constitutes the foundation upon which you can build your ultimate Moneyball sales analytics, starting with daily sales goals.</p><p> Truth be told, the scope of what sales leaders can do with performance analytics extends well beyond what will be covered here.</p><p> But nailing this first, critical step will give you the path to future success.</p><p> <img alt=\"daily sales goals\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nMmu95w.png\"/></p><p> The 26 daily sales goals in the Hustler's Index of Daily Sales Goals may or may not apply to your particular sales team. </p><p> They work best in inside sales teams, metric-driven sales forces or any other sales organization with a repetitive daily sales process that involves a few core activities. </p><h3> 26 Examples of Daily Sales Goals </h3><p> <br/> Listed below are 26 unique sales metrics that may warrant daily goals in your sales force. Some skew more towards business development, while others are more appropriate for closing.</p><p> Either way, all 26 daily sales goals are worth your consideration. Select the ones most appropriate to your team and start creating your Moneyball sales strategy.</p><h3> 1. Outbound calls</h3><p> <br/> As straightforward as it gets -- the number of calls you made that day. If you want to segment cold calls from other business calls, a good way to do so is limiting these to \"New Prospect Calls.\" </p><p> Track via: Phone system or CRM. </p><h3> 2. Outbound connections</h3><p> <br/> This one gets overlooked but is much more telling as to performance.</p><p> Example: Two Account Executives each make 50 cold calls in the same day. Account Exec #1 sets 5 meetings while Account Exec #2 sets only 3.</p><p> Account Exec #1 obviously performed better, right? </p><p> <img alt=\"daily sales goals\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NydATOd.png\"/></p><p> Not if Account Exec #2 only connected with 15 of his prospects, while Account Exec #1 connected with 30. </p><p> Whether or not a prospect picks up a rep's cold call is largely beyond the rep's control, provided the call is during normal business hours. </p><p> To more accurately guage performance, you can control for that by measuring outbound connections.</p><h3> 3. Connect Rate</h3><p> <br/> If your reps frequently call into gatekeepers, this metric comes in handy.</p><p> Getting past the gatekeeper is an art in itself, and connect rate will help you identify the Picassos on your sales force.</p><h3> 4. Connect Conversion Rate</h3><p> <br/> Hearkening back to Outbound Connections, this metric illuminates rep performance in converting prospect connections into first meetings.</p><p> This is where Moneyball comes into play.</p><p> <img alt=\"daily sales goal\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nJ60ZUn.png\"/></p><p> The beautiful thing about metrics like these is that, used in the appropriate context, they give all sorts of insights into not just your reps, but your messaging. </p><p> Top performers typically will have found the key pain points and path of discussion that create the highest likelihood of success.</p><h3> 5. Voicemails Left</h3><p> <br/> If your sales force incorporates voicemails into its outbound process, this is another metric worth tracking. </p><h3> 6. Voicemails returned</h3><p> <br/> A stat worth tracking since it helps reveal the ROI from the voicemails themselves.</p><p> The number of positive responses from voicemails will offer indications about effective voicemail messaging and duration. </p><h3> 7. Voicemail conversion rate</h3><p> <br/> Voicemail messaging is tricky, so this is a stat that can help delineate who seems to have found a groove, and if/how it can be scaled across the entire sales team.</p><h3> 8. Emails sent</h3><p> <br/> Same as outbound calls. Again, if you want to zero in on cold emails, only, segment and define \"New Prospect Emails\" in your CRM.</p><p> Track via: CRM, Sales Automation Platform or Email Tracking Software.</p><h3> 9. Email open rate</h3><p> <br/> This metric applies best to sales development reps that use email correspondence as the primary means to move prospects through their pipeline. </p><p> <img alt=\"email open rate\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rjUk9T3.png\"/></p><p> Email open rate can offer good insights on messaging, subject line effectiveness and so forth, provided you the right controls are in place.</p><p> Namely, limiting focus to cold emails sent prior to the prospect's initial response.</p><h3> 10. Email click rate</h3><p> <br/> If you're getting clicks, something's working. Maybe it's the body of the email, or perhaps the links and/or media you're including.</p><p> Whatever the case, if one of your rep's email templates is performing head and shoulders above everyone else's - it's worth investigating.</p><h3> 11. Email reply rate</h3><p> <br/> Same as the above, except better. For these, you'll definitely want to control for negative responses, by the way.</p><p> A rep might get 20 replies in a given week, but 4 of those could be, \"Go the f*** away.\"</p><h3> 12. Email conversion rate</h3><p> <br/> Like connection conversion rate, this is the rate a rep is converting outbound emails converted into meetings. </p><h3> 13. LinkedIn Messages Sent</h3><p> <br/> Pretty straightforward. LinkedIn messages can help you test out social selling and see how response rates compare to emails, voicemails and so forth.</p><p> <img alt=\"daily sales goals social selling\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JtYnNN1.png\"/></p><p> Helpful for when you want to mix social selling into your outbound process.</p><h3> 14. LinkedIn Replies</h3><p> <br/> Again, cut and dry. Should be treated just like email replies. </p><h3> 15. LinkedIn Reply Rate</h3><p> <br/> Just get this number and you've done enough - too many potential variations for LinkedIn conversion rate, and well, it's still LinkedIn. You've done enough.</p><h3> 16. Talk Time</h3><p> <br/> Used appropriately, this sales metric can give boatloads of insight into the ideal conversation length of a cold call, time until disqualification and so forth.</p><p> Talk time is also good for getting insights on an individual level.</p><p> <img alt=\"daily sales goals\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Uzyv2m5.png\"/></p><p> Example: Let's say you have a team of 20 business development reps.</p><p> The team leader in talk time ranks 7th in connect conversion rate, while the connect conversion rate leader ranks 2nd in talk time.</p><p> You now know that</p><li> Your connect conversion rate leader tends to have longer conversations. </li><li> Your talk time leader likely gets close to setting up 1st meetings but falls just short sometimes.</li><li> The latter could probably get some helpful advice from the former. <br/>  </li><h3> 17. Meetings Set</h3><p> <br/> Again, straightforward. A helpful metric but to a large extent mitigated by conversion rates of meetings to qualified leads, proposals sent and so forth.</p><h3> 18. Leads Worked</h3><p> <br/> An interesting number that could say a lot about individual efficiency and hustle.</p><p> You've been part of a sales team where one guy works 45 hours a week and not a moment over, while another guy racks up 60 but still lags behind in revenue.</p><p> Leads worked is your control to test true hustle and efficiency.</p><p> Mr. 45-Hour-Week put the blinders on, crushed the phones and worked 150 leads that week, while Mr.60-Hour-Week only worked 120, due to time spent reading LinkedIn articles and overthinking his emails.</p><p> Track leads worked and you won't get fooled.</p><h3> 19. Sales Meetings</h3><p> <br/> How many 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th meetings (later ones too) sales meetings did you have with a decision maker today? </p><h3> 20. MQLs</h3><p> <br/> ​Some industries (mine included) measure daily marketing qualified leads. These are prospects who inbound to your company.</p><h3> 21. SQLs</h3><p> <br/> ​​The corollary to MQLs are sales qualified leads. These are prospects who become leads due to sales outreach.</p><h3> 22. Proposals</h3><p> <br/> How many proposals did your Account Executives give out today that are just a signature away from becoming closed deals?</p><p> We only count each proposal the first time it's delivered, not in subsequent swaps back and forth during contract negotiations.</p><h3> 23. Deals Won</h3><p> <br/> How many new contracts were signed, sealed and delivered?</p><p> The viability of deals won as a daily sales benchmark is predicated upon volume.</p><p> <img alt=\"daily sales goals\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/anXL7M3.png\"/></p><p> If you're selling premium enterprise software that costs tens of thousands of dollars to adopt and implement, chances are you're not closing a deal per day.</p><p> (And if you are,  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:jeremy.boudinet@ambition.com\">   email me  </a> </u>  and explain what your process is so I can write about it in a future post).</p><h3> 24. Deals Lost</h3><p> <br/> How many worked leads bit the dust due to signing with a competitor, losing interest or some other reason?</p><p> Many deals lost are judgment calls, so it's important to be as objective as possible in making your assessment (i.e. don't cling to a prospect you know to be D.O.A.) </p><p> Avoid denial and overcome the burning desire to keep your pipeline looking as full as possible.</p><h3> 25. Revenue</h3><p> <br/> Total revenue generated from the day's deals. Whatever all the numbers on the newly signed contracts are, added together.</p><p> If they're agreeing to pay it, it's revenue, even if it's a service fee.</p><h3> 26. Profit</h3><p> <br/> Total revenue minus costs of goods sold.</p><p> The term costs of goods sold will vary depend on industry and it's up to your best judgment to figure out what factors in to this equation.</p><h3> Playing Moneyball with Daily Sales Goals</h3><p> <br/> Daily sales goals can become the cornerstone of your organization's sales process, analytics and performance management.</p><p> For the best long-term results, Datanyze stresses a commitment to  <u>  continuous auditing, experimentation and evolution </u> .</p><p> Your daily sales goals, like the sales reps they apply to, should be dynamic, living, breathing parts of your organization.</p><p> To ensure that happens, we recommend finding ways to strikingly visualize daily sales goals and sales personnel's progress towards them. </p><p> With strong codification and compelling visibility, your daily sales goals can become a powerful force for good in your sales team for the indefinite future.   </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-07 19:11:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-07 19:11:45.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_gnhz65r.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-hustlers-index-of-daily-sales-goals/\", \"post_id\": \"8454\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-07 19:11:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-07 19:11:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-hustlers-index-of-daily-sales-goals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8453\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3986\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Hustlers-Index-of-Daily-Sales-Goals.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"957\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452276000,"author_id":228,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3847,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Brand Association Isn't Enough — You Need Design Thinking","link":"brand-association-isnt-enough-you-need-design-thinking","source_link":null,"content":"<p> My daughters are fluent French-speaking wonders, and they&rsquo;ve taught me something amazing about linguistics and communication. French speakers implement a specific salutation for different people <a href=\"https://frenchtogether.com/you-in-french/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  holding different stations within society </a> . It seems obvious, and there are some remnants of it in English, but we might have forgotten the lesson it was supposed to teach us.</p><h3> Consider who you&rsquo;re speaking to when crafting the message.</h3><p> <br/> I recently saw an advertisement from a large insurer mimicking a self-recorded video in an attempt to create something authentic and relevant. The high production values, scripted language, and awkward talent told me all I needed to know. The insurer didn&rsquo;t know who its audience was or what&rsquo;s important to it. Combine that with a forced execution, and I was left scratching my head and feeling altogether uncomfortable and confused.</p><p> Marketing is a relationship. At its best, marketing makes us feel special, understanding our needs and communicating based on what the marketers know of us. At its worst, it feels like a tone-deaf opera singer blasting away in your ear.</p><p> Brands that are good at marketing are good listeners, constantly examining the conversation and looking for ways to connect more deeply. Brands that stumble don&rsquo;t listen, a reality amplified by the sheer number of widely accessible listening tools.</p><h3> Design Thinking Is the Next Frontier</h3><p> <br/> The rapid advancement of design tech has changed the tools we use to communicate and what defines design. Marketing isn&rsquo;t just a visual &mdash; it&rsquo;s the behavior before, during, and after the message has been received. Brands should approach their marketing plans as they would develop any other product: with an understanding of the intended outcome as the driver for the design thinking that guides the development of the campaign.</p><p> The deluge of customer profile data, devices, modes, media, and messages requires the use of a design-thinking approach to effective marketing. Design thinking explores new ideas and puts structure into the development of new concepts.</p><p> Consider where the most interesting conversations are happening right now. Social media enables a one-to-many and one-to-one dialogue between brands and individuals. Wearable technology is the nervous system for making marketing and experiences intelligent &mdash; it provides a deeper, more intimate view into the behaviors, needs, and wants of every wearer.</p><h3> Brand Association as a Standalone Tactic Is Done</h3><p> <br/> Clearly, changing the game works. Marketing that doesn&rsquo;t follow the rules expresses a deeper understanding of the problem space and how to address it. So forget about the old cliche  &ldquo;make the logo bigger.&rdquo;</p><p> That approach means one thing and one thing only: that this product or service can&rsquo;t stand on its own and needs the recognition of the brand to justify its existence. Platforms like <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kickstarter  </a> </u> wrecked the assumption that brand association is a critical ingredient. Learn what your audience wants from you and why. The best experiences blend brand and utility into one experience, making the product itself the marketing platform. Instagram and apps like it create their own marketing platforms through social interactions.</p><h3> Design thinking in practice</h3><p> <br/> I have walked a winding path over my career as a creative; leading in-house design teams at tech companies, experience teams at monolithic digital consultancies and nimble design firms. Each environment taught me a new way to understand the necessity of design thinking and new ways to apply this method to solve almost any problem it encounters. Design thinking is the equivalent of Henry Ford&rsquo;s production line for the information economy. We use it as a method for the consistent pursuit, production and development of ideas.</p><p> Over the course of my career I have seen too many ideas fall short of their potential because they lacked the necessary process to ensure their production. Design thinking is a critical business function that improves the value of what we apply it to. Marketers can take advantage of design thinking and shape the way their teams work with each other and across the organization. Design thinking can be implemented in three steps.</p><li> Explore many ideas using the lack of time to your advantage. The goal is to generate different directions for future exploration. Guide your <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/09/the-secret-phrase-top-innovato/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   exercises with &ldquo;how might we&rdquo; questions  </a> </u> , examining new points-of-view. <u>  Stanford&rsquo;s D-School </u> set&rsquo;s the standard approach to open-ideation through their approach. Exploration is also the space where we demystify technology to better understand where the message will be received.</li><li> Experiment and make the idea real as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Marketing-led initiatives are the beating heart of customer experiences. Coming to the table with a developed idea serves a couple of really valuable purposes. Prototypes encourage a &ldquo;show first, tell later&rdquo; approach to sharing ideas while they help you think through the blind spots long before ideas are set in stone. <u>  <a href=\"http://www.invisionapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Invision  </a> </u> is a great tool for creating prototypes and accelerating the product and idea development process, enabling quick refinements throughout the process.</li><li> Validate everything and co-design ideas with your audience.

{"original_id":3848,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"New Year Intentions, Not Resolutions","link":"new-year-intentions-not-resolutions","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The New Year is usually the time where people are making all kinds of resolutions. It's a tradition. It's also a tradition to abort the attempt around the 2nd week of January, once we are getting wrapped up in all our daily hassles. Personally, I don't believe in setting myself up for failure, that's why I think about all the things that I want to change and I put intentions behind it.</p><h3> Make resolutions when it matters <br/>  </h3><p> Resolutions and goals shouldn't be set based on a date, but on a need. If you feel that you are overweight, try to eat healthier immediately (even if it's March) but make adjustments in moderation. Most humans are not wired to make drastic changes, so essentially if we make drastic changes, very often we are setting ourselves up for failure. Especially in sales, we are usually stressed and putting additional pressure on ourselves will only lead to more stress.</p><h3> What happens when we set ourselves up for failure? <br/>  </h3><p> We feel like losers and it will take a long time until we attempt another try. Usually, it's another New Year's resolution the following year.</p><h3> Why is it important to manage expectations with ourselves? <br/>  </h3><p> Because we should manage expectations every single step of the way. Whether it's with our children, with our clients, with our prospects or our friends. We should never over-promise or under-deliver. It not only harms our reputation and our relationships, it is bad for the way we feel about ourselves. It eats away at our self esteem and once that happens it will influence or performance.</p>It's really hard to run a successful business or to succeed in sales when we feel that we have let other people and/or ourselves down.<p> <br/> My intent for this year is to balance my life even more. To stay healthy, spend more time outdoors and to stay connected with my friends and family.</p><h3> Put an action plan behind your intentions <br/>  </h3><p> Staying healthy and spending more time outdoors along with staying connected with my friends may sound like lofty goals, so I need to put action steps behind them. I plan on walking my dog twice a day, rather than once. I plan to research foods that I eat even more and to eat out less. AND, I plan to meet a friend for lunch or dinner once a week.</p><h3> Don't punish yourself <br/>  </h3><p> I will reward myself with a special treat (such as buying a new pair of earrings or a massage, should I stay somehow on track (don't be too judgmental with yourself). This is another incentive to take care of myself. I promise myself that I won't feel bad if I fall off the wagon, so to speak. Because, it's easy to get back on if you are gentle with yourself.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-07 19:39:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-07 19:39:01.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_QV1SJz4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/new-year-intentions-not-resolutions/\", \"post_id\": \"8459\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-07 19:39:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-07 19:39:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"new-year-intentions-not-resolutions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8458\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3988\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/New-Year-Intentions-Not-Resolutions-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"570\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452265200,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}

I admit it. I&rsquo;ve been critical of leaders who make declarations like &ldquo;THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE CUSTOMER.&rdquo; My problem with those types of statements is that I believe every year should be the year of the customer. Why else are we in business?In support of my position, I offer the following: <strong>  If you want to keep customers in 2016&hellip;. </strong> <strong>  Worry less about your prices and spend more time elevating your customer experience. </strong>  According to Accenture, customer churn is linked more to bad service moments than to price related issues. <strong>  If you want customers to tell their family and friends about you in 2016&hellip;. </strong> <strong>  Focus on making sure you resolve customer issues in ways that don&rsquo;t just satisfy customers but that also make them &ldquo;happy.&rdquo;  </strong> The White House Office of Consumer Affairs reports than when a brand resolves a dispute in ways that leave customers &ldquo;happy,&rdquo; those customers typically tell 4 to 6 people about the brand&rsquo;s service recovery. <strong>  If you want to save money marketing to new customers in 2016&hellip; </strong> <strong>  &ldquo;Love on&rdquo; the customers you already have!  </strong> Research by Bain &amp; Co. proves that it costs 6 to 7 times more to attract than to retain existing customers. Hmm&hellip; Spending 7 times more to bring customers into your business (some of whom aren&rsquo;t loyal by nature) or investing far less on the ones who want to be in relationship with you. Which will you choose this year? <strong>  If you want a competitive advantage driving customer engagement in 2016&hellip;. </strong> <strong>  Measure and drive employee engagement. </strong>  In my recently released book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.driventodelight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Driven to Delight: Delivering World-Class Customer Experience the Mercedes-Benz Way  </a> </u> , I reference research from Gallup which estimates disengaged employees contribute to lost US productivity of between 450 and 500 billion dollars (yes, that&rsquo;s billion with a B). My favorite definition of employee engagement is the amount of &ldquo;discretionary effort&rdquo; expended by your people. If you want your team to exert more discretionary effort on behalf of your customers, you need to expend more &ldquo;discretionary effort&rdquo; on behalf of your team!I suspect your passion for your customers isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;new!&rdquo; However, the research studies I referenced above should send a jolt of &ldquo;RENEWED&rdquo; urgency to executing outstanding customer experiences in this NEW Year! <strong>  If you need help, I&rsquo;m here to listen and offer assistance as you focus on great team and customer experiences in the year ahead.

No sooner are millennials getting comfy in their management swivel chairs than the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/fashion/move-over-millennials-here-comes-generation-z.html\" target=\"_blank\">   next wave has begun to arrive  </a> </u> . They&rsquo;re called &ldquo;post-millenials,&rdquo; the &ldquo;iGen,&rdquo; and, most commonly, &ldquo;Generation Z.&rdquo; They were born in the 15-year period starting around 1995, which makes them anywhere from 6 to 21 years old. There are roughly 60 million of them in the U.S., slightly more of them than millennials. And it&rsquo;s time for some intergenerational understanding as Generation Z begins to assume its position in the workplace.</p><h3> From a Different World</h3><p> <br/> Consider the world in which Generation Z grew up. Unlike millennials, they haven&rsquo;t suffered the heartbreak and resulting cynicism that happen when the world gets more complicated and scary. Instead, climate change, the presence of terrorism, school shootings, and the shrinking middle class are just realities to deal with. Multiculturalism and modern lifestyle inclusiveness are all simply baked in.</p><h3> Always On</h3><p> <br/> And technology, of course, is second nature to Generation Z. Where millennials grew up on  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod\" target=\"_blank\">   iPods  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace\" target=\"_blank\">   MySpace  </a> </u> , Generation Z is the first generation ever raised on the ubiquity of mobile phones, and always-on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Snapchat  </a> </u>  is more likely their jam than leave-a-message Facebook. They assume a steady stream of information.</p><h3> Generation Z Speaks</h3><p> <br/> This video, by Generation Z&rsquo;s Sofia Gray, explains who these young people are versus what older people fear. It&rsquo;s pretty exciting. Gray draws on research like &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://danschawbel.com/blog/39-of-the-most-interesting-facts-about-generation-z/?utm_content=buffer8d3a5&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   51 Of The Most Interesting Facts About Generation Z  </a> </u> &rdquo; (39 facts when the video was made), &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/06/apathetic-teens-generatio_n_1323577.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Generation Z Teens Stereotyped as &lsquo;Lazy and Unaware&rsquo;  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; and &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alison-martin/making-history-for-generation-z_b_4666268.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Making History for Generation Z  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eYAGqCbXVtU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-07-at-11.47.37-AM.png\" width=\"844\"/> </a></p><p> Together, it all means Generation Z is ambitious, aware, competitive, and daring.

{"original_id":3851,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Habits Are More Powerful Than Goals","link":"habits-are-more-powerful-than-goals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The first step toward success is having a goal. Yet, many people with goals failed to reach them. Here are a few ideas for your business plan to help you question your own goalsetting and get on your way for the next twelve months. <strong>  Focus on activities that will save you effort later. </strong> In his book  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1885167776/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=the%20one%20thing&amp;qid=1452131224&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=theclidripra-20&amp;linkId=86fa4389383106ca986667953c04026f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The One Thing  </a> </u> , Gary Keller shows you how to accomplish significantly more by consistently asking what actions you can take that will reduce or eliminate effort in the future. The effects of doing a little extra work today that will eliminate the need to perform some similar future task repetitively are like compounding interest, with similar exponential benefits. Rather than asking &ldquo;what actions do we need to move us in this direction?&rdquo; Keller might have you ask &ldquo;what can we do today so that the work it takes to get to the goal is reduced or eliminated?&rdquo; <strong>  Set goals for what you can control. </strong>  Let&rsquo;s say you want to increase your assets under management by 20%, Should that increase be your goal? I argue that it should not be because there are so many things outside your influence that affect those asset levels. If the market goes up 20% does that mean you did a great job? Of course not. If you transferred in assets that represent 25% of your beginning of year assets and the market fell 10%, does that mean you did a bad job? As an alternative to the end-product type of goal, try making activity goals. Determine the future you want &ndash; say it is to increase your assets by 20% - and then strategize how you will attract those assets. It may be seminars. Maybe it is systematically asking for introductions to clients&rsquo; LinkedIn connections. Whatever you decide to do, determine how much of that activity it should take. And that becomes the goal. Conduct 6 seminars this quarter. Ask three clients a week for an introduction. The point is that the activity is the goal. The goal is entirely under your control. And you can achieve it a lot more frequently than once a quarter. You will need to evaluate if the activity is generating the desired outcome. If you anticipated that you would need to ask for three introductions to get one and every four introductions would yield a client, measure as you go. You may find that your assumptions are a little off and you will need to adjust your activity level. The point is that the goal is an activity rather than an outcome. <strong>  Evaluate progress frequently. </strong>  Some firms I coach have me conduct a quarterly (or even less frequent) session with advisors. If the goals are not revisited between those sessions, we don&rsquo;t usually see much progress. Others follow up our group coaching with monthly or even weekly check-ins. In  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Great-Game-Business-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385348339/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452135295&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+great+game+of+business&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=theclidripra-20&amp;linkId=94be4938ba251434d23759c5807216ea\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Great Game of Business  </u>  , </a>  Jack Stack describes his company&rsquo;s weekly staff meeting lovingly named the Great Huddle. Everyone who is responsible for delivering some statistic of performance reports their result. In public. Every week. People are regularly reminded of their goal. It is never far from their mind. Most important, they talk about it leading up to the Huddle. They discuss it afterward. If they missed it, there is conversation about what they will do to get back on track. Managing performance is a whole separate topic. The point is your plan should include how often you measure progress. <strong>  Determine what you will stop doing. </strong>  You likely have a full schedule. Your staff probably doesn&rsquo;t have lots of down time. If you want the future to be different than today (which is the point of a strategic plan), you need to make room for the new things you will do. Spend some time considering what activities you or your staff perform that do not contribute value to your process, to the company, or to your clients, and drop them. <strong>  Take action. </strong>  In a planning meeting last week, a business partner charitably observed of me &ldquo;you are a planner.&rdquo; By which he meant I have a habit of spending so much time figuring out what to do I don&rsquo;t leave enough time to actually accomplish what we want. A friend of mine is a management consultant who likes to say &ldquo;get 60% of the way there&rdquo; when running planning meetings. Don&rsquo;t worry about having every detail worked out. Have a vision. Develop a strategy. Take action. Debrief after each step and review how it went. Rinse. Repeat. Focus on the doing. <strong>  Habits are more powerful than goals. </strong>  In the final analysis, specific goals may not be so important after all. Successful people win because they have good habits. Especially if you are not running an organization with more than half a dozen people, your habits exert a much more powerful influence over the direction of your firm than any strategic plan you create. The habit I am working on this year is throwing out my to do list at the end of each day. I use lots of technology but still always have a legal pad handy on which I write tasks that need doing. The same sheet frequently makes it into the next day. If I fill it up or need a clean sheet, I have a habit of flipping the top sheet over and starting a new page.  There are lots of times I may have four or five pages of partially completed to-do lists. And that&rsquo;s one of the ways I drop things. I miss a deadline. I break a promise. It&rsquo;s bad, I know, and please don&rsquo;t anyone tell David Allen I violate one of those fundamental principles of Getting Things Done. And that&rsquo;s what I have determined I will change this year. Each day, every item that cannot be done that day will go into my CRM (if it is related to a client) or into  <u>  <a href=\"https://nozbe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nozbe  </a> </u>  (if a project unrelated to a client). And I will throw that piece of paper away and start with a clean one tomorrow. Today is the 6th of January. I have succeeded in this new habit twice so far. I know I need 28 days pretty much consecutively to make it a real habit. And I will get there. Maybe it will start tomorrow. Maybe next month. But I will continue to work on it. And this habit will probably help me accomplish more than many of the goals I set.I hope some of these ideas help you write more productive goals for 2016. How have you improved your goal setting? What strategies have you found to help you accomplish your objectives? I would love to learn some of what you have found successful if you will post it in the comments below.Happy New Year, and may your year be the most successful yet!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-07 19:50:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-07 19:50:46.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_XEzvVtU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/habits-are-more-powerful-than-goals/\", \"post_id\": \"8466\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-07 19:50:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-07 19:50:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"habits-are-more-powerful-than-goals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8465\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3991\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Habits-are-More-Powerful-Than-Goals-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"707\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452249000,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3852,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Find The Man (Or Woman) Of Your Dreams","link":"find-the-man-or-woman-of-your-dreams","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There are few species, in the animal kingdom, that seek a mate more than humans. The driving forces behind this pursuit are safety, security, and/or procreation. Though, for those of you familiar with my work, you understand that we possess not only an animal, primitive&mdash;automatic&mdash;brain, but also a higher mind, the seat of our Divine nature. Attracting and maintaining a relationship has these two facets of our being competing and sometimes, especially when it comes to sexual intimacy, working together. The partner of whom you have dreamed may be much closer than you think, when you look at your world through your mind&rsquo;s eye rather than your animal brain.  Understand this: your animal (primitive, automatic) brain has one purpose&mdash;to protect you from danger. And it has only two ways to do that&mdash;by fight or flight.</p><p> Here are some helpful ways to find the man, or woman, of your dreams. </p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t care so much </h3><p> I know you&rsquo;re getting older and your biological clock is ticking. This &ldquo;danger&rdquo; of that clock ticking puts so much pressure on you that you may become obsessed which causes you to fight (becoming bitter or aggressive, for instance) or flee (inaction, passive, withdrawn).</p><h3> 2. Don&rsquo;t try so hard</h3><p> Similar to not caring, trying to hard chases people away. You come off seeming needy and in search of someone to protect you rather than share life with you.</p><h3> 3. Be open-minded</h3><p> Be especially on the lookout for any type of prerequisites you may have. Many of the requirements you may have set forth in meeting someone come directly from your automatic brain. For example, physical attraction is only one part of &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo; and usually wanes after several months. The depth of one&rsquo;s character can make that person quite stunning or downright ugly. Avoid strict requirements and be open to the whole person.</p><h3> 4. Pursue opportunities to meet others with similar interests </h3><p> Look to join a group that shares your passion for the outdoors, for example. If you are passionate about your religion, consider a dating site that caters to that. Maybe take a course at a local college in a subject about which you have always curious.</p><h3> 5. Be a good listener</h3><p> When we talk, it is usually expressing something that already know, or on which we have an opinion. When we listen, we can always learn something new. Whether the person you meet is &ldquo;the one&rdquo; or just a new acquaintance, listening can always make the experience, if not fun, at least more interesting!</p><h3> 6. Take care of your body</h3><p> Nurture your body. This means feeding yourself with food that will empower you and make you healthy.</p><h3> 7. Recognize that you don&rsquo;t need anyone to complete you</h3><p> Unfortunately, the quest for a &ldquo;soul mate&rdquo; or someone to &ldquo;complete&rdquo; you usually leads to a dead end. As I have said in the past, &ldquo;In order to find your soul mate, you must first discover your soul.&rdquo; We are all born with a piece of the Divine within us&mdash;our soul. We can only look to share that with another, not out of necessity. Seeking &ldquo;completion&rdquo; will tend to lead to a co-dependent, needy relationships.</p><h3> 8. Honor your individual gifts, talents, innate abilities</h3><p> Not having something that you so desperately want can lead to comparing yourself and your life with others. What this does is blocks you from seeing your magnificence.</p><h3> 9. Continue to grow</h3><p> Before and after you meet someone, continue to make life exciting and interesting. There is always new information to learn; new things to experience. Be sincerely passionate about life. Real passion is contagious and incredibly attractive.</p><h3> 10. Leave the past behind</h3><p> Yes, I know, he was &ldquo;the one&rdquo;, but he left you for another women or your family broke you up because of cultural differences. Well, you have two choices: wallow in your pity an continually remind yourself of your loss or move on. The latter is your only choice for happiness. Remember what the Dalai Lama once said, &ldquo;Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck.&rdquo;</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-07 20:00:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-07 20:00:11.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_33YtULe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/find-the-man-or-woman-of-your-dreams/\", \"post_id\": \"8468\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-07 20:00:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-07 20:00:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"find-the-man-or-woman-of-your-dreams\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8467\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3992\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10-Ways-to-Find-the-Man-or-Woman-of-Your-Dreams-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"957\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452272400,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

Is there any data to back up these awful allegations about Millennials? Good news&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t look like it.</p>Actually, in many cases with Millennial stereotypes, the opposite is actually true.

Hey, maybe we&rsquo;re not so bad after all!<p> Interestingly, when it comes to sales specifically, the traditional markings of a Millennial make us a great fit for the profession.</p><p> Here are the top three reasons we want to join your sales team and why you should give us a chance.</p><p> <strong>  1. We Want to Change the World (While Selling Your Product) </strong></p><p> We are the first generation to believe that  <u>  business can affect greater change than government </u> . For that reason, find us a product we believe in and we will sell it all day long. When choosing an employer,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2014/01/29/study-millennials-work-ethic-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/\" target=\"_blank\">   95% of Millennials say that a company&rsquo;s reputation matters to them  </a> </u> . What concerns really get us going?</p><p> The four issues most often cited as important to Millennials are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-dttl-2014-millennial-survey-report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reducing unemployment, reversing resource scarcity, protecting the environment, and addressing inequality of incomes and wealth  </a> </u> .</p><p> If we&rsquo;re working for a company with a mission statement that resembles our own, it&rsquo;s easy for us to find, pitch and close prospects. Having grown up in the word-of-mouth generation, we understand the value of referrals and truly want to solve the prospect&rsquo;s problem. We were solution selling before solution selling was cool.</p><p> In addition, sales positions are a combination of some of  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/07/teaching-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our favorite things  </a> </u> ! Featuring job satisfaction, work/life balance, autonomy, merit-based rewards and the opportunity to interact with a variety of people. At the end of the day, we&rsquo;re all working towards the same goal: workplace happiness and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/happiest-jobs-in-america-2014-1#5-sales-representative-16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sales is rated as the 5th happiest job in America  </a> </u> . Cherry on top:  <u>  salespeople who are happier at work sell more </u> .</p><p> <strong>  2. We&rsquo;re Texting at Work (While Closing Deals) </strong></p>I know you hate to see us texting at work, but it turns out we&rsquo;re actually nurturing our social selling profiles and warming the pipeline. We&rsquo;ve grown up attached to our phones (<u> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/90-of-18-29-year-olds-sleep-with-their-smartphones-2012-11\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  90% of us sleep with them </a></u>) but that&rsquo;s not such a bad thing. We&rsquo;re digital natives and can <u> adopt new technologies and methodologies twice as quickly</u> as the general population. We&rsquo;re also more than willing to <u> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-the-office-millennials-are-the-boss-when-it-comes-to-technology-1435020052\" target=\"_blank\">  teach these new tips to our co-workers </a></u> (just ask!) and peers.<p> We leverage all levels of social media to listen and learn our customers&rsquo; needs and wants. We can even  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2013/05/19/study-78-of-salespeople-using-social-media-outsell-their-peers/\" target=\"_blank\">   help you find customers where you don&rsquo;t think to look  </a> </u>  - Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, blogs, webinars, gorilla marketing. All we need is a little bit of leeway and a vote of confidence. Help us help you.</p><p> Our communication channels may not fit the old cold-calling mold but rest assured we&rsquo;re not all playing Angry Birds all day. We&rsquo;re reaching out to prospects via chat, texts, and emails; we&rsquo;re engaging with future customers on their blogs, Quora, reddit, and social media channels. Still skeptical? Research shows that all of this social selling pays off.  <a href=\"/category/sell/social-selling\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   46% of social sellers hit quota compared to 38% of sales reps who don&rsquo;t leverage social selling  </u>  . </a></p><p> <strong>  3. We&rsquo;re Data-Driven and Want to Learn (Really!) </strong></p><p> We grew up being able to Google anything, any time. How old is Beyonce? Will it rain tomorrow?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.xoombi.com/blog/sales-email-subject-line-best-practices\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What subject line results in the highest click-through rate  </a> </u> ? Having grown up with these resources at our fingertips, we&rsquo;re used to digging for the data that we need. We&rsquo;re more likely to approach sales as a science than an art.</p><p> A/B testing our subject lines, recording our open-rates and religiously updating our CRM, we&rsquo;re happy to track our performance. We&rsquo;re open-minded and willing to try new tools to help us reach (and exceed) quota.</p><p> We&rsquo;re also on course to become the most educated generation in North American history. Among 18 to 24 year olds -  a record share,  <u>  <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=98\" target=\"_blank\">   41% - were enrolled in college  </a> </u>  as of 2012, according to the most recent census data. And the learning doesn&rsquo;t stop there,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/team-building-and-staffing/ibm-stereotypes-of-millennials-are-wrong/d/d-id/1319155\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we want to learn in the workplace too  </a> </u> ! 39% of us would opt to attend a third-party sponsored conference, 37% would attend classroom training and 36% would work with a mentor to learn on the job.</p><p> Millennials can make an invaluable addition to any sales team that&rsquo;s willing to adapt to today&rsquo;s Selling 2.0 Ecosystem.

{"original_id":3854,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Science of Willpower","link":"the-science-of-willpower","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From the <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People  </u> </a></p><h3> Your mind can do anything.  <strong>  The question is: can your spirit? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Willpower is a combination of courage, mental stamina and determination.</p><p> New Years resolutions are upon us, and you need to be mentally strong to prepare to meet your goals. As humans, we have tremendous capability. We can solve complicated problems, dream and imagine new possibilities and learn complex skills. But most of us spend our time doing the same mental activities over and over again.</p><p> <strong>  We underutilize our brain power. </strong></p><p> We skim Facebook instead of delving into our next big work project. We watch Netflix instead of learning a new skill. We flip through magazines instead of writing the next Great Novel.</p><p> Why? Because achievement is a lot of work! Pushing our mental boundaries is challenging, uncomfortable and exhausting.</p><p> Willpower is what gets us through. People with high willpower:</p><li> <strong>  Get more done </strong></li><li> <strong>  Achieve greater success </strong></li><li> <strong>  Are above average in their abilities </strong></li><li> <strong>  Stand out from the crowd </strong> <br/>  </li><p> I want to delve into the science of willpower &mdash; how it works and what you need to do to get more of it. I will be using the incredible research from our Science of People book club book,  <a href=\"http://kellymcgonigal.com/books/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Willpower Instinct </a> , by Dr. Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford University psychologist. Dr. McGonigal will show us how willpower is the key to improving our health, happiness and productivity.</p><h3> <strong>  #1. The Willpower Challenge: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Before we get started, I want you to think of your willpower challenge. McGonigal encourages readers to think of 3 different willpower goals. Fill in the blanks and use these as you read the tips below.</p><p> What do you want to do more of?</p><li> I will ___________________ <br/>  </li><p> What do you want to do less of?</p><li> I won&rsquo;t _________________ <br/>  </li><p> What longterm goal are you working towards?</p><li> I want __________________ <br/>  </li><p> Now that you have your challenges in place, let&rsquo;s talk about how to tackle them.</p><h3> <br/> <strong>  #2: Self-Knowledge </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;To succeed at self-control you need to know how you fail&rdquo; &ndash; Dr. McGonigal </strong></p><p> Willpower is about doing. It&rsquo;s also about knowing your trigger points, your mental traps and your habits. So let&rsquo;s do some self-exploration.</p><p> Oh yeah, and get real.</p><p> It&rsquo;s time for brutal honesty. Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s just you reading this post. I won&rsquo;t tell anyone if you have ever eaten cake out of the trash can or gone to the gym for a workout, but really just took a steam or haven&rsquo;t counted carbs if you ate them standing up.</p><h3> The Dunning-Kruger Effect:</h3><p> <br/> Research shows that people who think they have the most willpower are actually the most likely to lose control when tempted.</p><p> This is not a new idea. We tend to overestimate most of our abilities. Have you ever seen a High School talent show? Everyone (even if they don&rsquo;t admit it) think they are going to win. Please self-evaluate with the following questions:</p><li> <strong>  Where do you most often &lsquo;give in?&rsquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  When do you most often &lsquo;give up?&rsquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  What exhausts your willpower the most? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  #3: Two Toned Brains </strong></h3><p> <br/> Willpower is a finite resource.</p><p> We don&rsquo;t think of willpower as a muscle, but we can &lsquo;run out&rsquo; of it at the end of a long day. Just like a bicep or quad, it gets fatigued after lots of use. This is because willpower comes from a certain area of our brain. Specifically, willpower is managed by our pre-frontal cortex.</p><p> McGonigal explains it like this:</p><p> We have two brains. An impulsive pleasure seeker and a wiser achiever. The pleasure seeker wants treats, fun and entertainment. The achiever wants to make good longterm decisions&ndash;this is dictated by willpower.</p><p> The more our pleasure seeker is tempted by candy bowls in the office, a friend asking to play hookie and pings from our Words with Friends game, our achiever brain has to rein us in. After a while, that muscle gets tired of saying no. This is why at the end of a day, you binge eat on ice cream after saying no all day. The willpower part of our brain gets tired when we use it too much. That is because it is constantly fighting the pleasure seeker. We need willpower to make good longterm decisions. Without it we would be eating candy all the time, watching TV and never working out. So, willpower is a biological instinct that evolved to help protect ourselves from ourselves.</p><p> <strong>  Temptation and stress hijack the brain&rsquo;s systems of self-control. </strong></p><p> We don&rsquo;t even realize how often we&rsquo;re exercising our willpower muscle. One of my favorite studies asked people how many food related decisions they make on a daily basis. They guessed they made an average of 14 food choices. Want to know the real average? 227.</p><p> <strong>  We make 227 food choices in the average day. </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s 227 times your willpower muscle has to flex. No wonder it&rsquo;s tired!</p><h3> <strong>  #4: Gaming the System </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can actually game your two brained system. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><li> <strong>  Remove as many small exercises in willpower as you can. </strong> Get rid of the candy bowls. Ban notifications from your social networks. Do not go to the kitchen before dinner.</li><li> <strong>  Make your important decisions during high-willpower moments. </strong>  For example, my everyday willpower challenge is to workout. At the end of the day, I am wiped out and want to crash on the couch. So, I have a system where I text a friend in the morning (high willpower moment) to meet in the afternoon for a hike or tennis. I also book my workout classes ahead of time (and pay upfront) in the morning when it&rsquo;s easy.</li><li> <strong>  You can replenish your willpower muscle. </strong> Specifically, McGonigal recommends meditation (which increases blood flow to the prefrontal cortex), breathing, extra sleep and being outdoors as a great way to recharge. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  #5: Strengthen Your Muscle </strong></h3><p> <br/> Since willpower is a muscle, you can strengthen it. Just like doing reps at the gym, you can &lsquo;tone&rsquo; your willpower. Banish that mental cellulite! McGonigal makes it clear that our brain actually puts on the brakes before we reach empty. It&rsquo;s like when your gasoline light comes on&ndash; it comes on as a warning, but you know you still have several miles left. The brain is the same way. Take running for example. Let&rsquo;s say you are on the treadmill and your legs begin to burn and your brain says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at my limit, I better stop!&rdquo; In actuality, you could go further, but your brain is playing it safe. When you are training for a marathon, you tell your brain, &ldquo;Nope, I am going one more mile!&rdquo; And you do. And you get stronger. And you run faster next time.</p><p> You can do the same thing for willpower:</p><p> <strong>  I want you to be a mental athlete. </strong></p><li> <strong>  Next time you are tired or are about to give in, see if you can go one step further. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Commit to one small habit that you will do every day: </strong> meditate, call a family member, throw one old thing out</li><li> <strong>  When you are ready to give up or give in, think about your want power. </strong> Tie your current activity to a longterm goal or value. That can often give you the motivation to push a little farther. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  #6: License to Sin </strong></h3><p> <br/> I am so guilty of license to sin. This is when you do something good and so you give yourself permission to be bad. Do these sound familiar?</p><li> <strong>  I worked out extra hard </strong> , now I can have an extra portion.</li><li> <strong>  I ate great yesterday </strong> , I can have this sweet now.</li><li> <strong>  I finished all my work </strong> , I can have one cigarette. <br/>  </li><p> This license to sin happens when goals are being associated with &ldquo;being good,&rdquo; and so it becomes tempting to indulge in a reward. The only way to stop this behavior is to untie goals from &lsquo;being good.&rsquo;</p><li> <strong>  &ldquo;I have been good, therefore I should be rewarded.&rdquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  Instead: </strong> &ldquo;I have met my goal. That feels great!&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> This means tying your goals or actions to longterm desires or values. Or seeing the intrinsic benefits of an activity like getting endorphins when you work out (not license to eat more) or cooking dinner with your family means more quality time (not license to watch more TV).</p><h3> <strong>  #7: &ldquo;What the Hell&rdquo; Effect </strong></h3><p> <br/> The What the Hell effect is treacherous for goals. It&rsquo;s when good intentions fail and resolutions fall by the wayside. The What the Hell Effect happens when we start to slip on our goals and our willpower fails and so we begin to feel like a failure. As a failure we think, &ldquo;Oh, what the hell!? I might as well give in&hellip;&rdquo;  This happens because the moment we slip on a goal we feel guilty and self-blame. This self-shame triggers your body to want a dopamine hit (the pleasure chemical) so it can feel better. This means you now want more dessert, cigarettes, Facebook and french fries even more.</p><p> The answer: Self-compassion.</p><p> Surprisingly, McGonigal found that when people forgive themselves for missing the mark occasionally, the more quickly they get back on track. People who wallowed in guilt tended to spiral into a cycle of indulgence and shame&ndash;losing their grip on self-control.</p><li> Next time you slip up, let it go. Chalk it up to a one-time event and move on. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  #8: Your Future Self </strong></h3><p> <br/> I think this is one of the most fascinating studies I have ever read:</p><p> When we are asked to think about ourselves, certain parts of our brain light up. When we are asked to think about our future selves, different areas of our brain light up. Which areas? The same areas we use to think about other people.</p><p> In other words, we treat our future selves like another person.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;We think about our future selves like different people. We often idealize them, expecting our future selves to do what our present selves cannot manage.&rdquo; &ndash; Dr. McGonigal </strong></p><p> How does this affect willpower? In great and terrifying ways. We tend to borrow credit from tomorrow. Our inability to clearly see the future (we think we will be more like someone else later) leads us into temptation and procrastination. I love these questions to test how much you are relying on your future self:</p><li> <strong>  Are you waiting for a future you? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How will you be different in the future? </strong> Will your goals be easier to achieve?</li><li> <strong>  Do you think magically about how you will be </strong> , what will happen and what comes next in the future? <br/>  </li><p> When making decisions, do not over-commit your future self. Start now, don&rsquo;t wait. Don&rsquo;t defer choices and actions to sometime down the line. Hold yourself accountable to a timeline and stick to it.</p><p> One More Idea: McGonigal also encourages students to use visualization and imagine their future selves in vivid detail, enjoying the benefits of current good choices and commitments they are trying to make. In one study, non-exercisers imagined a healthier future version of themselves. Two months later, those people who visualized were more frequent exercisers compared to non-visualizers. The more real your future self feels, the easier it is to make current decisions you won&rsquo;t regret.</p><h3> <strong>  #9: Willpower Infected </strong></h3><p> <br/> Rule-breaking and loss of willpower is contagious.</p><p> Think of the 5 people in your life you spend the most time with. On a 1 to 5 scale (1 being no willpower at all and 5 being amazing willpower) where do they fall? Add that number up, divide it by 5 and that&rsquo;s probably where your own willpower is at. Other people&rsquo;s willpower rubs off on us.</p><p> If you have some major goals in your life or you want to reboot your willpower, you have to think about who you are spending time with.</p><li> <strong>  Who are the mentally strongest people you know? </strong> How can you be inspired by them?</li><li> <strong>  Who triggers you to lose willpower? </strong> How can you minimize their effect?</li><li> <strong>  Can you ask for help? </strong> Who can keep you accountable? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  #10: Never Say, &ldquo;I Won&rsquo;t&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t think about a purple bicycle. Don&rsquo;t! Really don&rsquo;t think about it!</p><p> The more we are told not to think about something, do something or try something the more we want that something. McGonigal says we should stop saying &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&rdquo; and instead give ourselves permission and freedom of thought. Studies of brain activation confirm that as soon as you give participants permission to express a thought they were trying to suppress that thought becomes less likely to intrude in the conscious awareness.</p><p> Willpower is not about suppressing thoughts, it is about changing action. It is not about shaming your brain into action, it is about inspiring and accepting it.</p><p> <strong>  Guilt and shame over your setbacks lead to giving in again, but self-forgiveness and self-compassion boost self-control. </strong></p><p> You are wonderful the way you are. Now it&rsquo;s time to optimize it. Think about how you can be your best self and how willpower can help get you closer.</p><li> <strong>  START: </strong> What&rsquo;s one thing you could do right now to have greater success?</li><li> <strong>  STOP: </strong> What&rsquo;s one thing you could stop doing right now to improve your quality of life? <br/>  </li><p> Do you have one stop and one start? Good! To give yourself extra motivation, give yourself more reason to act on these:</p><li> <strong>  What&rsquo;s one benefit you will get from your start / stop? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Who else will benefit in your life from your start / stop?  </strong></li><li> <strong>  Whats the first step to your start / stop? </strong> <br/>  </li>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-07 20:12:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-07 20:12:29.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_TH7aanr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-science-of-willpower/\", \"post_id\": \"8472\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-07 20:12:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-07 20:12:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-science-of-willpower\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8471\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3994\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Science-of-Willpower.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"723\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452284100,"author_id":498,"chart_url":""}

You&rsquo;re neck-deep in planning and goal setting. If you&rsquo;re a people manager, you&rsquo;re likely meeting with your team to establish performance agreements and developmental plans. Excellent. Don&rsquo;t forget about you.</p><h3> 8 Ways to Refresh Your Career in the New Year <br/>  </h3><p> The new year is the perfect time to step back and take some tangible actions to invest in your career. Here are 8 ways to get you started.</p><li> <strong>  Identify one fear to overcome. </strong> <br/> We&rsquo;ve all got them&ndash;the one area of our life that would improve if only we weren&rsquo;t too scared. How would your career (and life) improve if this were the year you got past it? Start by writing it down. This year I&rsquo;ll have the courage to _______. Then tell someone about your plan. The best way to build real confidence is to succeed at something that scares you. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Take an honest inventory of what&rsquo;s working and where you&rsquo;re stuck. </strong> <br/> What were the three behaviors that most helped your career and your professional brand in 2015? Which three behaviors got in the way? What, specifically, can you do to continue more of the beneficial behaviors and reduce (or eliminate) the non-productive or career damaging ones? <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Update your LinkedIn profile. </strong> <br/> Yes, you should. I&rsquo;m working with a company now that recently announced an 8000 person reduction. Many of those folks now scrambling to build the next phase of their career have admitted that they hadn&rsquo;t really worried about their LinkedIn profile before. Here are  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/learning-development/4-ways-to-become-a-linkedin-ninja/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   some hints  </a> </u>  to get you started. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Identify your big win. </strong> <br/> You have lots of goals and objectives to achieve this year, I get that. But it&rsquo;s worth identifying the one area where you&rsquo;re going to absolutely turn heads. What will you achieve this year that will be worth a champagne toast and others swarming to you to learn your secrets?  What can you and your team achieve that will really change the game? If you manage people, this is a great conversation to have in one of your first meetings of the year. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Clear out the clutter. </strong> <br/> A Gartner survey found that an average employee can spend up to $4800 just looking for stuff. Now before any of my awesome administrative assistants who&rsquo;ve supported me over the years start leaving pithy comments, let me admit I&rsquo;m terrible at this. So, instead of telling you how&hellip;. here&rsquo;s a  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237081\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   nice resource  </u>    </a> on the topic. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Build a networking plan. </strong> <br/> Make a list of people you would like to know better, and identify one way you can help them or make their job easier. I&rsquo;m also a big believer in  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/the-biggest-networking-mistake/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;just because&rdquo; networking  </a> </u> . Imagine the possibilities if you took a deliberate approach to getting to know a bit more about the folks you encounter as you go through your day (on the plane, at the gym, in that class you&rsquo;re taking). There&rsquo;s awesome power in the  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/weak-ties/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   strength of weak ties  </u>  . </a> <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Make your reading list. </strong> <br/> A study from the  <a href=\"http://www.kumon.co.uk/blog/reading-reduces-stress-levels/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   University of Sussex  </u>    </a> found that reading as little as six minutes a day can reduce your stress levels by 68%.  Most CEOs I know read (including me) read at least four books a month.  Of course I recommend  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP8INYq47nc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Winning Well for April (learn why here)  </a> </u> . Inc also has an  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/john-rampton/25-books-top-ceos-recommend-you-read.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   interesting list of books  </u>    </a> recommended by high-profile CEOs. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Get feedback </strong> <br/> Whether you use a simple  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/a-360-feedback-tool-you-can-do-yourself/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DIY approach to 360 development  </a> </u>  or invest a little more in a formal process like the one included in my  <u>  online course, Results that Last </u> , the best way to improve is to truly understand the perceptions of others. 360s can help you identify small behavior changes that can go a long way in building trust and improving communications. <br/>  </li><p> You have the power to make 2016 remarkable.</p><h3> Your turn.

{"original_id":3856,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Is It So Hard to Manage Money and Love?","link":"why-is-it-so-hard-to-manage-money-and-love","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I love power couples. When two strong-minded, confident people come to me for help with their financial planning, I know we&rsquo;re going to end up creating a savvy approach to managing their money. </p><p> Not only do dynamic duos exude positive energy and confidence, the merits of each personality often compensate for their character flaws in each other. </p><p> That said, their strong-willed determination to be the best does not guarantee that power couples don&rsquo;t experience power struggles or discord when it comes to money.</p><h3> Why is money such a hot-button issue for power couples? <br/>  </h3><li> Money is always an emotional and contentious issue for people who are uncomfortable discussing it.</li><li> Part of the reason the topic of money can create tension is that each of us develops a philosophy of saving and spending based on our life experiences, which are influenced by family, friends, and peers. Since these experiences and influences are different for every person, our philosophies sometimes clash with our spouse or business partners.</li><li> When the parents of one spouse instilled values of financial restraint and the parents of the other spouse adopted a &ldquo;party like it&rsquo;s 1999&rdquo; attitude, reaching middle ground on this issue can seem all but impossible. <br/>  </li><p> As a financial advisor, I inspire my clients to adopt the positive changes necessary for them to reach their life financial goals. Smart financial decisions can help them to adapt more readily to life transitions and move progressively closer to their financial goals.</p><h3> Here are some strategies that power couples can keep in mind to avoid power struggles over money:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Don&rsquo;t assume the process will be smooth sailing. </strong>  Simply recognizing and accepting the reality that you aren&rsquo;t going to agree on all aspects of any decision will lower expectations. Know, too, that while you can&rsquo;t&mdash;and don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;change each other, you can adjust how you communicate as a couple. Inflexibility and control often exacerbate the problem. It may help to consult a marriage counselor who can redefine the roles within your marriage. A CFP&reg; professional can work with you to identify and clarify your mutual financial goals and help you develop a plan to help you reach them. If money has become problematic in your relationship, it often makes sense to consult with an unbiased third party. </p><p> <strong>  2. If power is an issue for either person in the couple, rethink having a joint checking account.  </strong> Couples who disagree on how to budget their money should think twice before commingling their finances. One good option is to maintain a joint account for all household expenses&mdash;including your mortgage, utilities, insurance, and groceries&mdash;with each spouse depositing a percentage of their paycheck into that pool. All remaining income can be directed to separate accounts, giving both partners their own discretionary fund. </p><p> <strong>  3. Be sure to set aside some &ldquo;mad money&rdquo; for spa day or golf. </strong>  Having that account helps folks stay on track because they know that every month they can do whatever they want with that money without having to be accountable for how they spend it. If you know you can have a little bit of fun in the short term, it can make saving for future goals more palatable. </p><p> <strong>  4. Be transparent. </strong>  Money troubles often arise when one spouse assumes the role of Chief Financial Officer of the household. An easy solution is to pay the bills together, sit down to discuss your budget regularly, and bring some transparency to how financial decisions are made. Transparency enables &ldquo;spenders&rdquo; to see for themselves that if they continue their spending pattern, they won&rsquo;t be able to reach the mutual goals they established with their partners as part of the financial planning process. </p><p> <strong>  5. Document and disclose. </strong>  First and foremost: establish basic guidelines and structure for how you spend and save your money. Consider depositing income into a single account, managed by the more disciplined spouse. The more disciplined spouse, the &ldquo;saver,&rdquo; should then dole out a monthly allowance for discretionary expenses to the &ldquo;spender.&rdquo; It helps, too, for both parties to agree not to use credit cards for daily expenses and instead to move to an all-cash system, which gives &ldquo;spenders&rdquo; a greater appreciation for how much they&rsquo;re spending. It may seem as though one spouse is relinquishing control, but as &ldquo;spenders&rdquo; observe a decrease in debt, their relationship with their &ldquo;saver&rdquo; partners will become more harmonious. Both spouses should document and disclose all expenses and develop a spending plan or budget.

{"original_id":3858,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Unicorn Recruiting Trap – Why I've Stopped Hunting","link":"the-unicorn-recruiting-trap-why-ive-stopped-hunting","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Unicorns</p><p> &ldquo;A&rdquo; Players</p><p> Game Changers</p><p> Full Stackers</p><p> Just about every manager I know has hung their hiring hopes on the pursuit of mythical creatures. The unicorn in particular. To one degree or another, it&rsquo;s always been this way I guess, but to me, our obsession with recruiting &ldquo;A&rdquo; players feels frothier than ever. My hard scientific evidence of this fact admittedly is mostly the conversations I have with other managers and my twitter feed. But then again we&rsquo;re talking about imaginary creatures anyhow so who really cares about science.</p><p> In sports, the pervasive all-in pursuit of franchise players has always been there. A single player can literally change the fortunes of a franchise for a generation. Just ask Cleveland &hellip; Golden State &hellip; Edmonton. On sales teams, we often see 20% of the reps generating 80% of the sales &ndash; rock stars. In engineering &ndash; just about every tech company I&rsquo;ve worked with has a couple of legendary developers who know every line of code - who seem to be responsible for the lion&rsquo;s share of innovation.</p><p> These days it seems like every second conversation I have with fellow managers revolves around these unicorns. Where are they? How do we get their attention? Would they come work here? What do they eat? How do they behave in the wild?</p><p> It&rsquo;s getting to the point where the prevailing logic seems to be that you just find one or two unicorns for your team and the rest will &ldquo;take care of itself&rdquo;. That the 80-20 rule sets the model for how a team should operate. That the top 20 percent of your team should contribute 80 percent of the productivity.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not buying it.</p><p>  &ldquo;Does operate&rdquo; &ndash; maybe. &ldquo;Should operate&rdquo; &ndash; not in my opinion.</p><p> This is where I think we&rsquo;ve gotten confused. Keep in mind, I too was a unicorn hunter at one point. But I&rsquo;m not anymore. In my experience, the reason we put &ldquo;A&rdquo; Players on a pedestal is that we&rsquo;ve failed to develop as managers. Getting the most out of a unicorn is easy &ndash; they are hard wired to be great. That doesn&rsquo;t make you a good manager. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make your team great either. Instead of learning how to build great teams based on a variety of people and personalities and types, we bank our success on hiring a few unicorns to carry the load. That may work up to a point. It might keep the lights on &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the way teams SHOULD work.</p><p> In my opinion, you can achieve a certain degree of success taking the unicorn-first approach, but to be a truly great team, you need another approach entirely. When it comes to building teams, I subscribe to more of a moneyball approach &ndash; I&rsquo;m trying to build the Oakland As &ndash; a team where the greatness in every player is identified, developed and embraced.</p><p> As I&rsquo;ve said, I wasn&rsquo;t always this way. In fact, I used to be quite cynical when it came to developing people &ndash; I was a nature trumps nurture guy. I believed people came with the talent they had been born with and my job as a manager was to find more of the ones born with lots of it.</p><p> It&rsquo;s taken me more than a decade of managing people, watching teams perform and not perform, seeing people at their best and at their worst to come to the following realization:</p><p> My number one job as a manager is to create an environment where each individual person on the team can be at their personal best. That&rsquo;s the job. Create the conditions whereby every person on the team can be the greatest version of themselves. </p><p> <strong>  Why is this at odds with hunting unicorns?  </strong></p><p> What I see are managers building teams, focusing recruiting, creating environments designed to embrace and elevate the unicorn. And this comes at a price. When you focus your time, energy and praise on unicorns, it means you&rsquo;re not focusing on developing the non-unicorns &ndash; the majority. I don&rsquo;t think you can do both.</p><p> <strong>  But doesn&rsquo;t the presence of unicorns raise everyone else&rsquo;s game? </strong></p><p> Not for everyone &ndash; no. In my experience, each person is unique &ndash; that&rsquo;s my point. To truly embrace a team-first approach you need to expend a great deal of time and energy on actively nurturing each individual. You need to architect the conditions for everyone to improve &ndash; not just the unicorns. You become more of a concierge than a manager in my model.</p><p> In actual fact I&rsquo;ve seen the presence of unicorns hurt the performance of other people on the team. They can&rsquo;t see themselves in the model the unicorn has set. That can be deflating.</p><p> <strong>  So how do you build an environment that brings out the best in everyone instead of just the unicorns? </strong></p><p> Here are some of the principles I follow for my team:</p><p> <strong>  Ditch the high pressure and intensity. </strong> I don&rsquo;t think the majority of people respond well in a high pressure environment. So I don&rsquo;t do this anymore. My goal on a day to day basis, is to make each individual on my team feel as comfortable as possible. When people are comfortable, they perform at their best. When people are comfortable they are at their most creative. This is what we should be striving for.</p><p> <strong>  Openly discuss everyone&rsquo;s developmental journey. </strong> I want everyone on the team to be on a journey towards a better version of themselves that is aligned with the personal goals they have. I don&rsquo;t constrain this conversation to quarterly performance reviews and career conversations either. I want it out in the open as part of the daily discourse within the team. I want everyone on the team to know about the goals and dreams of their teammates. When this kind of openness is present, I&rsquo;ve seen amazing things happen. People help each other.</p><p> <strong>  Favor a Capacity to Learn over Point in Time Talent. </strong> Too often we focus on the &ldquo;talent&rdquo; people have when they walk in the door on day one. We focus on what MBA program they went to 15 years ago. These are snap shots. They&rsquo;re indicative only of talent in one specific window. If a person is going to be on my team for 4 years, I want the one who&rsquo;s going to get better every day &ndash; the one who&rsquo;s dedicated to learning. In my experience, that&rsquo;s very often not the person who has the most natural talent.</p><p> <strong>  Keep the focus on team goals. </strong>  There&rsquo;s no question employees need to understand their purpose at work and have the autonomy to pursue it. They also deserve recognition for their successes. But the most important thing is to define the context of that purpose and those successes in terms of how they impact the overall team goal. What we want to minimize, in my opinion, are celebrations of individual success that are not directly tied to the mission of the team. When you do this, it can lead to the wrong behaviors and negatively impact the sense of team unity. The day to day narrative should be about what the team is striving for and celebrations should be about how individuals and groups have helped advance that cause.</p><p> The unicorn recruitment strategy is widespread. As managers we scour the earth in search of these mythical creatures to be the cornerstones for our teams. Often times we feel like if we can just get a couple of these &ldquo;A&rdquo; players, the rest will take care of itself. But this strategy comes with a cost. It&rsquo;s hard to find unicorns. Unicorns might not want to come work at your little known company. Unicorns might not be enthralled by your maturing industry and 5th generation technology. Not everyone who looks like a unicorn actually is one. And sometimes, the presence of unicorns can actually harm the team dynamic.</p><p> So in 2016 I invite you to join me in going unicorn-free and instead focus on discovering and developing the individual greatness in every member of your team.  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-07 20:42:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-07 20:42:42.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_DTlG1xp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-unicorn-recruiting-trap-why-ive-stopped-hunting/\", \"post_id\": \"8479\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-07 20:42:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-07 20:42:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-unicorn-recruiting-trap-why-ive-stopped-hunting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8478\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3998\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Unicorn-Recruiting-Trap.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"684\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452268800,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3860,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What's the Difference Between Skills and Competencies?","link":"whats-the-difference-between-skills-and-competencies","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a competency specialist, we&rsquo;re often asked whether there is any difference between skills and competencies. Are they just different words for the same thing, or do they function differently as talent-management tools? Let&rsquo;s take a look at each of these terms in more detail.</p><p> In some ways, a skill and a competency are similar. They both identify an ability that an individual has acquired through training and experience. But the two concepts are not identical in terms of their definitions or the function they perform within the talent-management process.</p><h3> The &ldquo;what&rdquo; vs. the &ldquo;how&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Skills define specific learned activities, and they range widely in terms of complexity. (&ldquo;Mopping the floor&rdquo; and &ldquo;performing brain surgery&rdquo; can both be classified as skills.) Knowing which skills a person possesses helps us determine whether their training and experience has prepared them for a specific type of workplace activity. In other words, skills give us the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; They tell us what types of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.talentguard.com/address-skill-shortages/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   abilities a person needs  </a> </u>  to perform a specific activity or job.</p><p> But skills don&rsquo;t give us the &ldquo;how.&rdquo; How does an individual perform a job successfully? How do they behave in the workplace environment to achieve the desired result? Competencies provide that missing piece of the puzzle by translating skills into on-the-job behaviors that demonstrate the ability to perform the job requirements competently.</p><h3> The bigger picture <br/>  </h3><p> Another major difference between skills and competencies is one of scope: competencies define the requirements for success on the job in broader, more inclusive terms than skills do.</p><p> Think of skills as one of three facets that make up a competency: the other two are knowledge and abilities. To succeed on the job, employees need to demonstrate the right mix of skills, knowledge, and on-the-job ability. A well-defined, multilevel competency defines each of these elements in terms that allow managers and HR professionals to observe and recognize them through qualifying materials such as resumes, tests, and interviews, and through on-the-job performance in the workplace.</p><h3> The competency advantage <br/>  </h3><p> While skills are an important part of any job profile, they&rsquo;re not robust or nuanced enough to guide your talent-management activities. To manage the talent lifecycle, you need a system that&rsquo;s consistent, structured, progressive, and unifying. Well-defined, multi-level competencies are designed to provide a strong but flexible foundation that links every HR activity.</p><p> <strong>  Consistency. </strong>  Skill definitions&mdash;particularly for technical skills&mdash;are often pulled from a variety of sources, and as a result, they lack consistency. A competency dictionary defines these types of skills in consistent terms so that employees can see how their skills, knowledge, and abilities align with their own position as well as others in the organization.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hrsg.ca/competencies/competency-dictionaries/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   View some examples of competency dictionaries  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Structure. </strong>  Competencies bring structure to HR activities that conventional skill definitions can&rsquo;t match. Competencies were designed to fit into an architecture that spans the entire organization and lends structure to different departments, teams, and other business units.</p><p> <strong>  Progression. </strong>  Unlike skill definitions, multi-level competencies define a specific skill at different levels of expertise and proficiency. Defining each of these proficiency levels is an invaluable tool for helping employees understand and take control of their career progression.</p><p> <strong>  Coordination.  </strong> A subset of competencies, called &ldquo;core competencies,&rdquo; is designed to articulate the key values and capabilities that form the organization&rsquo;s competitive advantage in the marketplace. Core competencies are shared by every employee in the company&mdash;from entry level to CEO&mdash;and bring greater unity, purpose, and coordination to the organization. Learn more about core competencies.</p><h3> Using competencies to manage talent</h3><p> <br/> Because competencies are more detailed than skills, and because they have an internal and relational logic, using them as a foundation for talent management requires greater rigor and care. In previous decades, the additional work involved in using competencies to define job success made many organizations hesitate to adopt them. But in the past few years, the process of building and deploying comprehensive competency architecture to support the organization has been revolutionized by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.talentguard.com/competency-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   software solutions  </a> </u> .</p><p> Replacing spreadsheets and paper-based processes with software enables organizations to create, deploy, and maintain complex competency architecture more quickly and easily. This type of platform also simplifies and automates key competency-based activities such as interviewing, managing performance, and developing talent. As a result, HR professionals no longer need to forego the benefits of a competency-based approach because they lack the resources to set up and manage it efficiently.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-07 20:59:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-07 20:59:14.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_e8IQ8na.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whats-the-difference-between-skills-and-competencies/\", \"post_id\": \"8483\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-07 20:59:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-07 20:59:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whats-the-difference-between-skills-and-competencies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8482\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4000\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Skills-vs.-Competency.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1239\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452261600,"author_id":309,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3861,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Managing Perfectionism","link":"managing-perfectionism","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElizabethMahane\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Elizabeth Mahane  </a>  y </u></p><p> Perfectionists aspire to be top achievers and do not allow themselves to make even a single mistake. They are always on the alert for imperfections and weaknesses in themselves and others. They tend to be rigid thinkers who are on the lookout for deviations from the rules or the norm.</p><p> Perfectionism is not the same as striving for excellence. People who pursue excellence in a healthy way take genuine pleasure in working to meet high standards. Perfectionists are motivated by self-doubt and fears of disapproval, ridicule, and rejection. The high producer has drive, while the perfectionist is driven.</p><h3> Causes and Characteristics</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Fear of failure and rejection. </strong> The perfectionist believes that she will be rejected or fail if she is not always perfect, so she becomes paralyzed and unable to produce or perform at all.</p><p> <strong>  Fear of success. </strong> The perfectionist believes that if he is successful in what he undertakes, he will have to keep it up. This becomes a heavy burden-who wants to operate at such a high level all of the time?</p><p> <strong>  Low self-esteem. </strong> A perfectionist's needs for love and approval tend to blind her to the needs and wishes of others. This makes it difficult or impossible to have healthy relationships with others.</p><p> <strong>  Black-and-white thinking. </strong> Perfectionists see most experiences as either good or bad, perfect or imperfect. There is nothing in between. The perfectionist believes that the flawless product or superb performance must be produced every time. Perfectionists believe if it can't be done perfectly, it's not worth doing.</p><p> <strong>  Extreme determination. </strong> Perfectionists are determined to overcome all obstacles to achieving success. This is also true of high achievers, but the perfectionist focuses only on the result of his efforts. He is unable to enjoy the process of producing the achievement. His relentless pursuit of the goal becomes his downfall because it often results in overwhelming anxiety, sabotaging his heroic efforts.</p><h3> The Costs of Being a Perfectionist</h3><p> <br/> Perfectionism always costs more than the benefits it might provide. It can result in being paralyzed with fear and becoming so rigid that a person is difficult to relate to. It can produce contradictory styles, from being highly productive to being completely nonproductive. Some examples of these costs include the following:</p><p> <strong>  Low self-esteem. </strong> Just as low self-esteem is a cause of perfectionist behavior, it is also a result. Because a perfectionist never feels good enough about himself or his personal performance, he usually feels like a loser or a failure.</p><p> <strong>  Gloominess. </strong> Since a perfectionist is convinced that it will be next to impossible to achieve most goals, she can easily develop a negative attitude.</p><p> <strong>  Depression. </strong> Perfectionists often feel discouraged and depressed because they are driven to be perfect but know that it is impossible to reach the ideal.</p><p> <strong>  Guilt. </strong> Perfectionists never think they handle things well. They often feel a sense of shame and guilt as a result.</p><p> <strong>  Rigidity. </strong> Since perfectionists need to have everything meet an ideal, they tend to become inflexible and lack spontaneity.</p><p> <strong>  Lack of motivation. </strong> A person who expects perfection may never try new behaviors or learn new skills because she thinks that she will never be able to do it well enough. At other times, she may begin the new behavior but give up early because she fears that she will never reach her goal.</p><p> <strong>  Paralysis. </strong> Since most perfectionists have an intense fear of failure, they sometimes become immobilized and stagnant. Writers who suffer from writer's block are examples of the perfectionist's paralysis.</p><p> <strong>  Obsessive behavior. </strong> When a person needs a certain order or structure in his life, he may become overly focused on details and rules.</p><p> <strong>  Compulsive behavior. </strong> A perfectionist who feels like a failure or loser may medicate him- or herself with alcohol, drugs, food, shopping, sex, gambling, or other high-risk behaviors.</p><p> <strong>  Eating disorders. </strong> Many studies have determined that perfectionism is a central issue for people who develop eating disorders.</p><h3> The Perfectionist versus The High Achiever</h3><p> <br/> People produce many of their best achievements when they are striving to do their best. High achievers, like perfectionists, want to be better people and achieve great things. Unlike perfectionists, high achievers accept that making mistakes and risking failure are part of the achievement process-and part of being human.</p><h3> Emotionally Healthy High Producers</h3><p> <br/> You can be a high achiever without being a perfectionist. People who accomplish plenty and stay emotionally healthy tend to exhibit the following behaviors:</p><li> Set standards that are high but achievable.</li><li> Enjoy the process, not just the outcome.</li><li> Recover from disappointment quickly.</li><li> Are not disabled by anxiety and fear of failure.</li><li> View mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning.</li><li> React positively to constructive feedback. <br/>  </li><p> Once you are aware of the ways by which you expect yourself to be perfect, you can start to change your behavior. In my next newsletter, I'll offer some tips to help you get started. Until then, begin the change process by thinking about which causes apply to you and writing down examples of these perfectionist behaviors as you observe them.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 15:56:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 15:56:59.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Jw7x0kj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/managing-perfectionism/\", \"post_id\": \"8485\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 15:56:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 15:56:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"managing-perfectionism\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8484\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4004\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Managing-Perfectionism.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"684\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452510000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3862,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What's Going on With China?","link":"whats-going-on-with-china","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Stock markets around the world are cratering barely a week into 2016 and it seems like we are back in August of 2015 when the last correction took place. Once again, China stands tall amongst macro drivers, along with plunging oil prices.</h3><p> <br/> Last Wednesday China&rsquo;s equity market closed early, down 7%, with trading halted within thirty minutes of the session opening as brand new circuit breaker rules (instituted in 2016) were triggered. This follows a similar halt on Monday. Chinese authorities are clearly scrambling, with their stock market regulator announcing on Thursday that it would be s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/china-stock-market-halt-suspended-2016-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  uspending the circuit breaker rule </a> , for now.</p><h3> So what&rsquo;s going on?</h3><p> <br/> It mostly comes down to understanding what is happening with the Chinese yuan and credibility questions about Beijing and the People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PboC). Chinese equity markets opened lower today after the PboC announced the yuan reference rate at a five-year low.</p><p> But some history may be helpful first.</p><h3> Moving to a managed floating rate system</h3><p> <br/> The yuan was pegged to the US Dollar (at 8.28 yuan per USD) until July 2005 when the peg was lifted and revalued to 8.11 per USD, strengthening the currency by about 2%. The idea was to make trade in the currency simpler and efficient as China went from a fixed exchange rate system to a managedfloating rate system.  The currency was allowed to float within a 1% band about the PboC&rsquo;s peg to a basket of currencies. The bank however ignored the previous day&rsquo;s trading when setting the midpoint fix (to the USD) for the next day.</p><p> The currency appreciated 21% to 6.83 per USD over the next three years. In August 2008 the global financial crisis prompted the PBoC to repeg the yuan to the USD and halt its appreciation as global demand waned.</p><p> China removed the dollar peg in June 2010 and the currency once again appreciated about 11% by the end of 2013 to about 6.05. Now even after all the appreciation between 2005 and 2013, the general consensus seemed to be that the currency was significantly undervalued, with US critics in particular accusing China of controlling its currency to give its companies an  <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/13/9149953/chinese-currency-devaluation-explained\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  unfair advantage </a> . Since the yuan would appreciate significantly against the dollar if allowed to float freely, China capped its rise by buying dollars and selling yuan &ndash; resulting in vast foreign reserves that peaked at $3.9 trillion in June 2014.</p><h3> A slowing global economy </h3><p> <br/> Over the past few years the US economy has strengthened while the rest of the world&rsquo;s economies, including China, seem to have stalled. As a result the dollar has appreciated, not least because central banks in Japan and Europe embarked on implicit policies to devalue their respective currencies and boost exports. As an export-dependent economy, China could potentially join this &ldquo;currency war&rdquo; by simply relinquishing some control over its currency and letting the market devalue it. Of course, in theory China&rsquo;s vast amount of reserves would allow it to step in at any point and prevent the yuan from falling too much.</p><p> In March 2014 the PBoC widened the yuan trading band around the daily fix to 2% (from 1%), allowing the currency to move up to 4% a day. By December 2014 the yuan spot price moved into the weak end of the trading band as markets tried to force the currency lower.</p><p> Meanwhile Chinese economic data continued to show a slowdown, with exports shrinking 9.5% on the year in July 2015.</p><h3> Currency reform or competitive devaluation?</h3><p> <br/> On Thursday, August 11th 2015, China surprised global markets with a 1.86% devaluation in the yuan&rsquo;s midpoint fix, their biggest such move since 1994. At the same time, an equally important announcement was a move to set the midpoint fix to reflect the previous day&rsquo;s close, thus making the yuan dependent on daily trading.</p><p> Ostensibly, China&rsquo;s goal was to allow market forces to have a greater role in its currency as a step toward making the yuan a global reserve currency. The IMF called it a &ldquo;welcome step&rdquo; even as it believed the currency to be  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-official-says-chinese-yuan-no-longer-undervalued-1432634534\" target=\"_blank\">   no longer overvalued  </a> </u>  and was considering including it in its SDR basket (Special Drawing Rights). On November 30, the IMF agreed to add the Chinese yuan to its SDR basket in October 2016, citing the yuan&rsquo;s role as  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/30/imf-agrees-to-include-chinas-rmb-in-benchmark-sdr-currency-basket.html\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   freely usable currency  </u>  &rdquo; </a> .</p><p> On December 11 the PBoC again caught the world off guard, announcing that the yuan&rsquo;s exchange rate will no longer be fixed to the USD, but instead to a basket of currencies that included the yen, euro, British pound but also the Russian rube, Thai baht, Malysian ringgit. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://asia.nikkei.com/Viewpoints/Viewpoints/The-stealth-devaluation-inside-China-s-currency-basket?page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nash and Wray  </a> </u>  discussed at the time, on the face of it the move looked like reasonable reform toward a more open capital account. However in practice the decision to depeg from the dollar could be interpreted as a move towards supporting a slowing economy and perhaps even regaining lost ground.</p><p> On January 6th 2016, the PBoC fixed the yuan to a fresh five year low at 6.53. The currency has fallen 6% against the dollar since July.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/USDCNY.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"CNY\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/USDCNY.png\"/> </a></p><p> Without going into too much detail and adding to an already long post, I will point out that there is an &ldquo;offshore&rdquo; yuan as well, which is allowed to trade freely in Hong Kong. The offshore yuan typically trades at a discount to the onshore yuan and is also at its lowest level in five years, while the spread between the two versions is at a record level. The PBoC&rsquo;s inability to narrow the spread, which it pledged to do last August as part of its goal to make the currency freely usable, raises concerns over their credibility.</p><h3> Exporting deflation</h3><p> <br/> Irrespective of China&rsquo;s motivations, the depreciating yuan could increase global currency tensions as China&rsquo;s ailing companies strive to become more competitive at the expense of rivals in Europe and Asia. Note that China is still the world&rsquo;s largest net exporter and is more dependent on the world than the other way around.</p><p> There are reports that the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-markets-yuan-policymakers-idUSKBN0UL24020160107\" target=\"_blank\">   PBoC is under increasing pressure  </a> </u>  from policy makers to let the yuan fall quickly and sharply, by as much as 10-15%, as its recent gradual softening is thought to be doing more harm than good. The bank&rsquo;s intervention has come at a cost. The PboC is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-foreign-exchange-reserves-fall-107-92-billion-in-december-1452161583\" target=\"_blank\">   spending billions of dollars of reserves  </a> </u>  to support a yuan under pressure even as economic growth is decelerating and capital flows reverse, with ordinary Chinese and businesses rushing to change yuan into dollars. FX reserves dropped by a record $107.9 billion in December and have fallen in every month but one since May as the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-foreign-exchange-reserves-fall-107-92-billion-in-december-1452161583\" target=\"_blank\">   next chart  </a> </u>  shows. Reserves have dropped 15% since June 2014, falling  more than half a trillion dollars to $3.33 trillion in December.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/china-reserves-m-m-change.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"china reserves m-m change\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/china-reserves-m-m-change.png\"/> </a></p><p> At first blush, it would seem that China has enough reserves to still maintain control over its currency. Nevertheless, as with any savings account, it gives you confidence until you start drawing it down.</p><p> The question no longer seems to be whether China is slowing &ndash; it is &ndash; but whether authorities can manage a &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo;? Till the past year, the answer seemed to be in the affirmative but confidence seems to be waning. Is China biting off more than it can chew, between managing its currency and starting global projects like the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aiib.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Asian Infrastructure Bank  </a> </u>  and the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/report/2015/09/22/121628/understanding-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Belt and Road initiative  </a> </u> ? All this in addition to the biggest task of them all: transitioning the economy from an export-based one to consumption-driven one.</p><p> The other question is whether China&rsquo;s actions will unleash a wave of deflation across the world, even as the Federal Reserve appears to have embarked on a tightening path (expecting inflation to rise back to target).</p><h3> Risks from an imbalanced global economy</h3><p> <br/> In the short-term, it remains to be seen how the various economies, and central banks, of the world fight deflationary pressures and stoke higher inflation. Or do they fall back on the American consumer as the last resort? This would not be an ideal situation for anyone.</p><p> In the years prior to the financial crisis, the rest of the world saved and bought American debt as consumers in the U.S. shopped, leading to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/04/03-germany-trade-surplus-problem\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   huge imbalances in the global economy  </a> </u>  &ndash; the fact that some countries had large trade surpluses (exports larger than imports) and others (like the U.S.) with large trade deficits. In the years after the crisis, the hope was, or is, that countries (like China) that rely mostly on exports would transition to a consumption-driven economy. However, with the rest of the world&rsquo;s economies remaining in stall speed and the U.S. dollar strengthening, American exports will continue to suffer even as another consumption binge looms, forestalling a more balanced global economy.</p><p> It would be ideal, even for the U.S. economy, if the rest of the developed world could reflate their economies while China and other emerging markets successfully manage to transition toward a consumption driven economies.</p><p> If not, the question becomes as to how long the U.S. can remain as an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/upshot/can-us-remain-an-island-of-stability-in-the-global-economy.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   island of stability  </a> </u> . Risks become enormous particularly if external headwinds creep onto U.S. shores and causes the economy to stall. The Federal Reserve does not too many tools left (other than QE and/or negative rates?). More crucially, the current political environment makes fiscal support less likely.</p><p> In a sense, the main macro story from 2015 continues into 2016 and we continue to monitor events carefully to see what the rest of the year will bring.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 16:09:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 16:09:08.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_5JgDjvS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whats-going-on-with-china/\", \"post_id\": \"8486\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 16:09:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 16:09:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whats-going-on-with-china\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8484\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4005\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Managing-Perfectionism.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"629\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452574800,"author_id":158,"chart_url":""}

In order for your content to perform the way you need it to, you&rsquo;ll have to create content that your audience will love.</h3><p> <br/> Of course this is easier said than done and many brands within the professional service industries struggle to say something new and different from their peers. With more and more brands producing helpful content, it can feel like everyone is humming the same tune rather than singing their own song.</p><p> Here are just a few ideas to help you craft amazing content that your clients will absolutely love.</p><h3> Get your clients&rsquo; input</h3><p> <br/> Perhaps an obvious way to inform your content creation ideas is to involve your clients in the process. If you really want to know what kind of content your audience wants from you, ask them! Float topics by them or allow them to freely tell you what they&rsquo;d like to know. Also, be sure to confirm what formats they prefer most (written blog posts, videos, podcasts, audio clips, images, email). Do you know how and when they consume your content? Are they at a desktop during working hours or are they on their cell phone at 11pm at night? Beyond the content itself, make sure your content delivery and timing is spot on to enhance your clients&rsquo; experience with your content!</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t regurgitate popular material</h3><p> <br/> If it&rsquo;s already been said, don&rsquo;t repeat the same ideas and positions. Instead, think of creative ways to lend your own perspective on a familiar topic and reference the existing material that you&rsquo;re responding and adding to. In the same way, why not start an entirely new conversation and not be afraid to be the first to have a certain opinion. Originality will help you stand out from the noise and help your clients see you as a thought leader.</p><h3> Make it actionable</h3><p> <br/> You can create something that is good and that your clients will think, &ldquo;That was an interesting read.&rdquo; Or you can craft something better that your clients can actually use. While your opinions are great and all, share more than an opinion &ndash; provide actionable takeaways in your content so that your clients can actually do something in response to what you&rsquo;ve created.</p><h3> Let your clients contribute content</h3><p> <br/> Your clients can receive a lot of value from hearing from each other. And when your clients provide you with content, not only does it take some of the content-creation burden off of you, but it lends far more credibility and authority to your brand than your voice alone. Let them share their story, things that they&rsquo;ve learned, ways that they&rsquo;ve overcome a certain challenge. Let their experience help your other clients and audience. Feature them in your newsletter or create a client spotlight piece. Create a private Facebook group where you facilitate discussions around topics that matter to your clients and prospective clients.</p><h3> Be entertaining and memorable</h3><p> <br/> Not all content needs to be educational, nor should it be boring. I&rsquo;m reminded of a great quote by Walt Disney:</p><p> <strong>  I would rather entertain and hope that people learned something than educate people and hope they were entertained. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s really not more complicated than that and I&rsquo;m not quite sure I can say it any better. Don&rsquo;t ever publish content just to get it out there. Crafting great content that gets consumed, shared and engaged with takes effort to make it better and more experiential than the droves of content already cluttering the internet.</p><h3> Keep it fresh</h3><p> <br/> In the same way, keep your content updated and fresh for your audience. Don&rsquo;t let your client&rsquo;s get tired of the same old content your brand produces. Change it up sometimes, surprise them &ndash; keep them interested. You will do well to keep them interested by consistently creating NEW content that grows with your client&rsquo;s interests and most pressing priorities and concerns. Keep a pulse on your clients and let it always inform the new ways you can publish great content for them.</p><h3> Keep it real and be honest with yourself</h3><p> <br/> Finally, be authentic and write to your audience with some personality. As a professional service, relationships are the cornerstone of your business&rsquo; success. Therefore, write in a manner that talks to your audience, not at them. I would really avoid any language that sounds like you&rsquo;re lecturing. Write the way you have conversations with your clients. Infuse it with the same energy you provide in face-to-face meetings and don&rsquo;t be too shy to get a little personal. There is enough vanilla sounding content out there already. Own your own flavor that your clients can get excited about.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 16:19:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 16:19:39.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_YEEhICv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-create-content-your-clients-will-love/\", \"post_id\": \"8488\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 16:19:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 16:19:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-create-content-your-clients-will-love\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8487\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4006\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Create-Content-Your-Clients-Will-Love.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"603\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452542400,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3864,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Classic Money Advice","link":"classic-money-advice","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Some financial advice just doesn&rsquo;t grow old. Many recommendations I've made for years are as applicable as ever for the 21st century, and they bear repeating. Here are some of the best financial moves to consider as you move into 2016.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Understanding and managing your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about money is as important as understanding how money works. </strong> Our brains are hardwired to make poor financial decisions. Exploring your money history and learning to identify your unconscious beliefs about money can change your financial behaviors forever. It is crucial to gaining and keeping control of your finances and becoming comfortable using money as the valuable tool it is.</p><p> <strong>  2. Building an emergency reserve to cover living expenses for six months to a year if you lose your job or experience a business slump isn&rsquo;t just a good idea, it&rsquo;s a necessity. </strong> If you are retired, having one to three years of cash available to cover living expenses can help you avoid taking money out of investments when their value has declined.</p><p> <strong>  3. Retirement will happen, sooner than you think. </strong> Start early&mdash;as in the day after college graduation&mdash;and be consistent in investing at least 20 percent of your paycheck in your 401k, IRA or SIMPLE plan.</p><p> <strong>  4. Learn to appreciate the word \"budget.\" </strong> Creating a plan to track and manage income and spending is an essential skill to survive and thrive financially. Numerous free or inexpensive tools, like Mint.com and Quicken, can help.</p><p> <strong>  5. Run from consumer debt. </strong> If you can afford a credit card payment after you purchase something, you can afford to save first and buy with cash. Personally, I use credit cards for almost every purchase for both convenience and cash back or travel rewards. However, it&rsquo;s imperative to pay the card off every month, without fail.</p><p> <strong>  6. A house is a home, not an investment. </strong> Don&rsquo;t buy more home than you can afford, and don&rsquo;t buy without a down payment.</p><p> <strong>  7. No asset goes up forever. </strong>  Price declines, even crashes, are a normal part of invsting. It&rsquo;s essential to understand that the value of your portfolio will fluctuate. Be prepared to ride out downturns. Selling in a down market is &ldquo;the big mistake&rdquo; that will cost you dearly.</p><p> <strong>  8.  The fundamental strategy for managing market ups and downs is asset class diversification. </strong> This doesn&rsquo;t mean having money in different banks, with different brokers, or in different mutual funds. It&rsquo;s about having a good balance of mutual funds that invest in U. S. and International stocks, U. S. and International bonds, real estate investment trusts, commodities, market neutral funds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and junk bonds.</p><p> <strong>  9. There are no free investments. </strong> Pay attention to the fees and taxes associated with any investment, as well as how the advisor recommending any investment is compensated.</p><p> <strong>  10. Pay yourself first. </strong> The most successful savers and investors I know simply take all their fixed expenses, taxes, and retirement contributions off the top of every dollar earned, then spend the rest. That means learning to live on 30% to 50% of every dollar you earn. This may sound unreasonable or even impossible for anyone who is just starting out, raising a family, or getting by from month to month. Certainly, it isn&rsquo;t easy. But one of the most valuable financial habits to create, beginning with your very first paycheck, is to save something for the future instead of spending everything that comes in.</p><p> You may well have heard this advice before. There's a reason for that: it works. The details of managing money may evolve, but classic money wisdom never goes out of style.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 18:16:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 18:16:49.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_1mFmpLP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/classic-money-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"8490\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 18:16:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 18:16:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"classic-money-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8489\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4007\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Classic-Money-Advice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"504\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452524400,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Overwhelmed? Under pressure already?</h3><p> <br/> If so, then you&rsquo;re not alone. Most company&rsquo;s management and sales teams are under immediate pressure already to begin accomplishing their new goals and sales targets. In fact, this pressure is also felt in the accounting department, the marketing department, and everywhere else. You can probably feel it in your company, too.</p><p> As you speak with your clients and prospects this week, realize that they are all feeling this pressure as well. While this may seem like a bad thing, it can actually present a great opportunity for you. Here&rsquo;s how I handle the companies and contacts I speak with this month:</p><h3> After talking briefly about the holidays and New Year&rsquo;s celebration, I always start with question number one:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;So ________, what are the top 3 initiatives for your department has this year?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Then I hit mute and take notes.</p><p> If they need a little help here, I use layering questions like:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;What was your revenue like last year?&rdquo; Or, </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;What percentage increase are you asked to produce this year?&rdquo; Or, </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;What are you doing differently to accomplish this?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;What do you think is most needed for you to succeed at that?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> After I&rsquo;ve listened and asked layering questions and taken notes on the three initiatives, I ask question number two:</p><h3> &ldquo;And how can I help you accomplish that?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Once again, I hit the mute button and take notes.</p><p> If I get an, &ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; then I once again use layering questions like:</p><p> &ldquo;Have you heard of my new automated Core Inside Selling Skills Webinar Program?&rdquo;</p><p> Or I ask a good assumptive question like:</p><p> &ldquo;How much of a budget do you have per quarter for sales training?&rdquo; Or,</p><p> &ldquo;How big of a role do you think increased sales training is going to play?&rdquo; Or,</p><p> &ldquo;If you could wave a magic wand and get three resources to help you accomplish your goals, what would they be?&rdquo;</p><p> Now I&rsquo;m sure you can come up with a few of your own questions here, but you get the idea. <strong>  The point is to ask questions and LISTEN to your prospect&rsquo;s response. </strong> If you respect the pressure they are feeling and truly offer a way to help them, then they will engage with you &ndash; and many will even put you to work for them&hellip;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 18:33:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 18:33:06.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_X6DX2rt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/two-great-new-years-questions-for-your-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"8492\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 18:33:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 18:33:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"two-great-new-years-questions-for-your-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8491\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4008\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Two-Great-New-Year\\u2019s-Questions-for-Your-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"517\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452531600,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3866,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Verbal Cues That Enhance Any Business Relationship","link":"5-verbal-cues-enhance-business-relationship","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s an ironic part of the year. While we hustle and bustle from one social activity to the next, many of our social interactions will feel rushed. The volume, the pressure, the accelerated pace. What longs to be <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\">  a time of connection </a> can quickly devolve into a series of rushed non-connections.Classic wisdom is that if we desire stronger relationships, we need to spend more time with folks. If you don&rsquo;t have more time to spend, use language that accelerates connection. This works best in person. It will work equally well on the phone or in writing. People with rich vocabularies , success guru Tony Robbins suggests in his book &ldquo;Giant Steps,&rdquo;  have a multihued palette of colors with which to paint their life&rsquo;s experience. Agreed. And the colors in your palette don&rsquo;t need to be high-falutin&rsquo;. Here are my top 5 verbal cues that I know will strengthen any business relationship we&rsquo;re in &ndash; and all others, as well. They may come in handy in this period of harried social contact:</p><h3> <strong>  1.   &ldquo;I was touched by &hellip;&rdquo; </strong></h3>Most of us, even if we&rsquo;re a little gruff on the outside, have a keen desire to impact folks. The deepest impact occurs when we touch someone&rsquo;s heart. This simple phrase indicates to the other person that s/he has, indeed, via an action or a gesture, had that sort of impact on us. Powerful.<h3> <strong>  2.   &ldquo;You really helped me &hellip;&rdquo; </strong></h3>It feels good to know that something we have done, no matter how small it may have seemed to us, has been of help to someone. It feels even better to hear this acknowledged. Whenever possible, let someone know that something they said or did, even if it was routine behavior for them, was helpful to you. &ldquo;Help&rdquo; is a crucial relationship word.<h3> <strong>  3.   &ldquo;I never looked at it this way before &hellip;&rdquo; </strong></h3>Especially in a conversation that may have had its rough patches, acknowledge that the other person had a positive impact on you. Made you think of new possibilities, had you question hidden assumptions, forced you to reach beyond easy answers. This phrase celebrates the positive aspects of a potentially uncomfortable conversation.Related: <a href=\"/grow/leadership/iggy-pop-and-the-case-for-curiosity\"> Iggy Pop and The Case for Curiosity</a><h3> <strong>  4.   &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with &hellip;&rdquo; </strong></h3>You may wonder, hey, how is disagreeing with someone a relationship-builder? Folks who have strong relationships with others are not afraid to disagree. They don&rsquo;t waste time dancing around a moment of disagreement. They state their disagreement &ldquo;in neutral.&rdquo; No raised voice, no elevated emotion, no drama. Just a fact. The moment a disagreement is stated, the conversation can shift toward new ideas and fresh solutions. How liberating!<h3> <strong>  5.   &ldquo;I know we can come up with something better &hellip;&rdquo; </strong></h3>Even as we discard a present state that we believe isn&rsquo;t working, we look to the future with unwavering optimism in our ability to deliver. The word &ldquo;we&rdquo; is a potent non-blame word. The affirmation of my faith in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; is a sublime relationship-shaper. Couple it with the verb &ldquo;can,&rdquo; and it is sure to melt at least a modicum of doubt and resistance.There are folks with whom it is tough to build relationships, I know. But even a tough nut tends to crack when approached with a relationship-enhancing cue.The most common objection I hear to the just-listed cues: This is simply not how I talk. That, of course, is the point. Would you say this when you start to learn a foreign language? Of course not. Consider these cues part of your new and enhanced vocabulary. Toss the objections. Expand your palette.

{"original_id":3867,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Unique Wealth Management Challenges Faced by Cross Border Professionals","link":"unique-wealth-management-challenges-faced-by-cross-border-professionals","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There are three main unique challenges faced by cross border professionals with assets in the U.S:</h3><li> <strong>  Asymmetricality: </strong> The asymmetrical nature of tax regimes and reach, i.e., U.S. federal and state tax law reaches much farther than does the tax law of almost any other country;</li><li> <strong>  Complexity: </strong> The complexity of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations; and</li><li> <strong>  Scarcity: </strong> Lack of sufficient help and information, especially for those who are not ultra-affluent.</li>Traditionally, it has been fairly common for certain types of professionals, especially those in Europe, to have a fairly high degree of mobility and find themselves living and working in multiple countries over time. Generally speaking, these individuals did not need a great deal of tax or other guidance with respect to how living in multiple countries might affect their personal financial and long-term wealth planning decisions due to the commonalities of those countries.On the other hand, once an internationally mobile individual touches the U.S. in his or her working life&mdash;whether that is made possible by a short-term work visa or a permanent assignment with a green card&mdash;then that person effectively becomes a U.S. tax resident, and things become both different and more complex.<strong> The Unites States is the only major nation to tax all citizens and residents on their worldwide income, no matter whether they currently reside in the U.S.</strong>So once an individual has official contact with the U.S and they become a U.S. tax resident, they are mandatorily subject to the worldwide nature of the U.S. income tax, and the U.S. will tax you on your worldwide income and assets, no matter what country that income occurs in or those assets are found in. This is even the case if you were to sell highly appreciated property, where the appreciation occurred before you even moved to the U.S.Fortunately, a fairly complex system of foreign tax credits ensures that there is little or no double taxation. However, there are many tricks and traps that the unwary can fall into, and a little bit of information and planning with regard to minimizing tax can go a long way and make a big difference. Similarly, with regard to assets such as bank accounts, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and real property, there are a wide variety of long-term planning possibilities and ways of leveraging and managing one&rsquo;s wealth for the long-term that are made more complex by U.S. tax law and regulations.<strong> Becoming a U.S. tax resident brings with it a great deal of potential complexity</strong>, both with regard to U.S. tax laws as well as other allied rules and regulations affecting things like moving funds from one country to another, opening accounts in more than one country, investing, business ownership requirements, and retirement planning. The U.S. system, then, is generally more complex both with regard to its tax code (many European countries have flat taxes or tax codes that are much simpler than the U.S. code) and the many other rules, regulations, and requirements that the U.S. imposes. For those cross-border professionals and globally mobile families with the most interest in wealth planning&mdash;which involves not only taxation and tax minimization strategies, but also questions of investment structure, asset allocation, savings and retirement plans, currencies, and so on&mdash;it can be a truly daunting task.In addition to asymmetricality and complexity, there is a third unique challenge: the scarcity of readily available help and easily accessible information. While those who are ultra-affluent can afford to put together a specialized team consisting of accountants, attorneys, and other professionals, most cross-border professionals find themselves facing a lack of good information and guidance. With so many unknowns and so many unclear (and shifting!) rules and regulations, it can be difficult for such families to gain a clear sense of what they have in hand, to clarify their goals for the future, and to make sure that what they&rsquo;re currently doing is aligned with and optimized for achieving those long-term goals.<strong> Similarly, for the most part, foreign investment firms and banks will not give advice to, assist, or otherwise get involved with a U.S. citizen living abroad who has questions or problems, due to risk-avoidance and red tape complexities. </strong>Interestingly, even those global financial institutions that have divisions in other countries are loathe to advise cross-border professionals, due to similar issues.Due to the assymetricality, complexity and scarcity issues, advising cross border professionals and mobile families has become an attractive niche for financial advisors to pursue.

{"original_id":3868,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Measure the Financial Impact of Your Customer Experience","link":"how-to-measure-the-financial-impact-of-your-customer-experience","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Medallia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Carolyn Egelman  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.medallia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Medallia  </u> </a></p><h3> Chances are, you intuitively understand the value of a great customer experience. But when it comes to making customer experience a priority across your organization, intuition is rarely enough.</h3><p> <br/> Regardless of whether or not company leaders believe that good experiences are good for the company, it&rsquo;s the initiatives that can be demonstrated to have a tangible impact on the bottom line that inevitably get the most attention.</p><p> But the impact of customer experience doesn&rsquo;t have to be a battle of opinions. There are several ways for you to prove &mdash; and quantify &mdash; the impact it will have on your own bottom line. Medallia has helped many leading brands gain this understanding; the following is an analytical approach that we&rsquo;ve found to be most effective.</p><p> The goal of a financial linkage analysis is to understand and compare how customers behave after various experiences with your company. For example: when a customer has an experience that turns them into a promoter, how much do they then go on to spend over the next year? What about after an experience that made them a detractor? Conclusions like these allow you to estimate how a customer will change their spending with you based on the quality of an experience that they&rsquo;ve had with your company.</p><p> Of course, on the revenue side, spending is just one many critical behaviors you can track. Depending on your business model, the outcome variable could be renewals or return visits. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s not the top line that you&rsquo;re interested in modeling &mdash; in which case, behaviors like calling a call center can help you estimate how the customer experience affects your cost-to-serve.</p><p> By analyzing the impact of these behaviors, your company gains the ability to make important decisions like:</p><li> <strong>  Predicting the impact of customer experience investments. </strong>  If you know that a 1-point NPS improvement increases a customer&rsquo;s future spending by X percent, and that a certain process improvement will yield an NPS increase of Y points, you can estimate how much additional revenue the improvement will bring in. You can also compare multiple investments in this way to decide which one to prioritize, based on which will have the greatest revenue impact.</li><li> <strong>  Prioritizing customer segments to target.  </strong> Which increases spending more &mdash; turning a detractor into a passive, or a passive into a promoter? If the former is true, the most pressing thing to focus on might be an initiative that rescues customers who&rsquo;ve received the worst experiences. You can come to similar conclusions about many types of customer segments, such as loyalty club members or first-time shoppers. <br/>  </li><h3> So how should you go about completing such an analysis? </h3><h3> <strong>  Answering these five questions will help you plot your course: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. What behavior will we focus on?</h3><p> <br/> We have already described several customer behaviors that directly impact revenue or cost-to-serve. Your choice of which one to track should stem from your company&rsquo;s unique business priorities. However, for transactional businesses, the most important behaviors are often variations on customer spending or return visits. For subscription business, meanwhile, important behaviors include renewals, upgrades and cross-sells.</p><h3> 2. Can we track individual customers?</h3><p> <br/> Many financial linkage analyses use data on individual customers&rsquo; spending habits and customer satisfaction scores. However, this isn&rsquo;t the only approach. Location-based businesses can track behavior on a store-to-store level, while B2B companies can do so by account.</p><h3> 3. How much data do we need to get an accurate result?</h3><p> <br/> The first consideration here is the time horizon that you&rsquo;ll work with.  You need to be able to track how satisfied individuals customers are, and then allow enough time for them to make the decision to give your company more (or less!) business. For example, a retailer will likely be able to work with a shorter time horizon than a B2B outsourcing company, where renewal decisions are made on the scale of years.</p><p> The second consideration is the total amount of customers you need to collect data on. This depends on many factors. If it&rsquo;s important to account for seasonality differences in your business, you&rsquo;ll want your dataset to include at least one year&rsquo;s worth of customer interactions.</p><h3> 4. Which customer segment or segments will we focus on?</h3><p> <br/> Comparing customers from the same segment &mdash; for example, how much they spend with you, how long they&rsquo;ve been a customer, or whether they&rsquo;re members of your loyalty program &mdash; give you a more accurate understanding of their behavior. Remember that the more segments you want to look at, the larger dataset you&rsquo;ll need in order to accurately understand differences.</p><h3> 5. What data analysis method should we use?</h3><p> <br/> The right answer depends on how much customer data you have. With limited data, you can segment customers into high-level segments and take a  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_statistics\" target=\"_blank\">   summary statistics  </a> </u>  approach, which allows you to make conclusions like: &ldquo;on average, promoters spend 10% more than detractors.&rdquo; With a richer data set, meanwhile, you can do a  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">   regression analysis  </a> </u> , which allows you to account for factors like channel, demographics, and types of product purchase. This kind of analysis allows you make statements like: &ldquo;accounting for differences in channel and geography, promoters spend 15% more than detractors.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s worth noting that great financial linkages analyses take time, as well as a fair amount of iteration. But the results are well worth the effort. Understanding how your customer experience impacts critical behaviors can drastically improve how your company makes investment decisions &mdash; and can raise the profile of the customer experience amongst company leaders. This is an important element of keeping customers at the center of your business.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 19:11:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 19:11:30.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_wfWyNmo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-measure-the-financial-impact-of-your-customer-experience/\", \"post_id\": \"8498\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 19:11:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 19:11:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-measure-the-financial-impact-of-your-customer-experience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8497\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4011\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Measure-the-Financial-Impact-of-Your-Customer-Experience.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"799\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452543300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3869,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Big Short","link":"the-big-short","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Fresh from watching the Big Short in a crowded theater in Philly, I wanted to shout out my experience from that time, using excerpts from my book: &ldquo;Making Money Matter&hellip; Impact Investing to Change the World.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;In early 2006, most of the Legg Mason advisors were invited to a big hotel and feted by Citigroup, one of the last occasions Sandy Weil held forth as chairman of what was then the largest corporation in the world in terms of &ldquo;impact&rdquo; (not necessarily &ldquo;positive impact&rdquo;). I excitedly assumed I could use these resources to expand the universe of investments available to my clients at Legg Mason. In fact, the opposite was true.</p><p> &ldquo;Tight, bureaucratic, and impersonal, the conference turned my stomach when the speaker leaned out like a snake oil salesman and said, &lsquo;You are going to make so much money on mortgages!&rsquo; He offered $2,000 for each mortgage application turned in&mdash;even if the mortgage was not realized. Jaws dropped, and brokers grinned. Something was amiss. They just wanted paper. Little did I know! The company needed &lsquo;paper,&rsquo; even worthless paper, to justify the debt on its balance sheets. This was the beginning of what might have been the end of big banks.</p><p> &ldquo;Six months later, on top of the unethical mortgage push, I noticed that interest rates on cash in my clients&rsquo; portfolios differed for no apparent reason. Clients with higher fees earned higher interest rates. Older folks, whose fees were minimal, lost yield in their cash. I was mortified and decided to get out when the Wall Street Journal praised Citi for following Merrill Lynch&rsquo;s business model of manipulating interest rates to improve the bottom line. How could I submit clients to this amoral manipulation? Little did I know I was jumping from the frying pan into the fire. I took a big risk by leaving the comfort of a big corporation, and I still had a great deal to learn.&rdquo;</p><h3> At the start of 2007 an independent advisor invited me into his debt-ridden lair to continue a habit of &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; from clients.</h3><p> <br/> He enabled me to build impact investment funds as long as I did not get involved with the debt fund we created or the finances of the firm.  I naively accepted, working in the dark with absolute trust in my new boss. Explaining what I had seen at Citi with the worthless mortgage applications, we prepared the clients for a down turn and entered 2008 60% in cash which meant that we lost only 5% in the meltdown of 2008 described in the movie. Then the auditors moved in and ultimately the founder of the firm was caught and the firm was shut down. Here is more from the book:</p><p> &ldquo;The financial industry is full of such stories. I imagine when a person gets in too deep in debt to see a way out, they may become numb and drift into a kind of mindless state of denial, seeing no harm in taking more and more until being caught or filing for bankruptcy. The phrase &lsquo;drowning in debt&rsquo; has taken on a new meaning for me. My earliest childhood memory is of drowning after I plunged off a diving board into the dark pool of the Brook, a swimming hole on our Connecticut farm. I remember blissfully staring up at the sun from the bottom, and peacefully watching my bubbles floating to the surface before my eight-year-old cousin rudely tackled me, dragged my three-year-old body onto the bank, and roughly pumped me out.</p><p> &ldquo;In this case, those who were exposed to the malfeasance also experienced the rude awakening along with the debtor. In reaction to the harm done to me and to my clients, I experienced all the stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In 2012, I took charge, along with a newly configured team of workers dedicated to fixing what we could and saving the best investments. Our goal was to prove that, over time, all clients, disgruntled or not, would realize that working with us had become beneficial.</p><p> &ldquo;A wise mentor once told me that life will never throw you anything you can&rsquo;t handle: the challenges of life would not be there but for your capacity to overcome them. The most difficult professional challenge I have had to endure was facing my shortcomings and the anger of friends. I chose to make amends by building the best team I could possibly lead.&rdquo;</p><h3> The Big Short brought that transition period from the big banks vividly back for me. </h3><p> <br/> It is a gripping reality drama and yet I fear that investors and advisors may experience it only as a story, a virtual reality, especially as the market recovered and the banks were not transformed.  In fact the &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; banks are 80% larger.</p><p> At the end of the movie a stunned audience was silent for a moment and an old man cried out &ldquo;Bernie Sanders in 2016!&rdquo; True enough, he may be the only candidate to call for serious financial systems change.  But the status quo is strong. I imagine another Bush/Clinton battle is already arranged.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 20:17:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 20:17:04.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_h5fi03s.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-big-short/\", \"post_id\": \"8500\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 20:17:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 20:17:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-big-short\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8499\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4013\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Big-Short.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"718\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452542400,"author_id":181,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3870,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Employees Want More Negative Feedback From Their Managers","link":"employees-want-more-negative-feedback-from-their-managers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You may think that, come time for performance reviews, your best bet is to offer words of encouragement to your employees. You know, praising them for their hard work and efforts while shifting focus away from areas where they could stand to improve.</p><h3> You&rsquo;d be wrong. Negative Feedback Is Helpful</h3><p> <br/> According to a study published in the  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/01/your-employees-want-the-negative-feedback-you-hate-to-give/?referral=00060\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> , nobody really likes to give a negative review. But more than half of us &mdash; 57%, to be exact &mdash; love to receive it, compared to 43% of us who enjoy hearing positive feedback only.</p><p> So why do these folks enjoy receiving negative feedback? According to the study,</p><p> <strong>  72% of them believe constructive criticism plays an important role when it comes to improving performance and advancing one&rsquo;s career. </strong></p><p> Your boss tells you what you&rsquo;re doing wrong, you listen to what they say, and you make the appropriate changes.</p><p> There&rsquo;s one catch: negative feedback has to be delivered the right way. Your employees don&rsquo;t want you to sit them down in your office only to start screaming about how terrible they are at the top of your lungs.</p><p> So what exactly is the best way to deliver negative feedback? Let&rsquo;s take a look:</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t wait</h3><p> <br/> You may want to use a convenient time like a performance review to convey negative feedback to a team member. But there&rsquo;s no sense in prolonging the inevitable. Once you&rsquo;ve made the decision to tell your employee what they&rsquo;re doing incorrectly, set aside some time that week (heck, even that day) to have a conversation. Don&rsquo;t delay.</p><h3> 2. Get to the point</h3><p> <br/> Your employees are smart people. If you try to cloak your negative feedback in a bunch of fluff (e.g., &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a hard worker!&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rsquo;re funny!&rdquo;), there&rsquo;s a good chance your worker will notice, and the negative feedback won&rsquo;t be as well received. A simple solution: be concise with your negative feedback. Say what you&rsquo;ve got to say, and move on.</p><h3> 3. Talk about specific behaviors</h3><p> <br/> Never make an employee on the receiving end of negative feedback feel as though the problem lies in their personality. Be sure to center your conversation on specific behaviors and specific actions. Let them know it&rsquo;s not about who they are but about what they&rsquo;ve been doing. Never get personal.</p><h3> 4. Let your employees speak</h3><p> <br/> In traditional environments, negative feedback might just flow in one direction, from the boss to the employee. To increase the likelihood your employees learn from the negative feedback you offer and improve as a result, give them the chance to speak their minds after you&rsquo;ve said your piece.

In short, they are open windows of &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; opportunities when someone searches for something top-of-mind using the closest device to them.

The significance of these micro-moments to financial service marketers is that they will be able to leverage them to be there when their prospects or clients need them.</p><p> <strong>  Every time a prospects needs or wants something, it is an opportunity for you to provide and be more then just an Advisor. </strong></p><h3> How can Financial Services compete for those micro moments?</h3><p> <br/> To start, identify your prospects and clients  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-the-buyer-journey-and-why-advisors-should-care/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   journeys  </a> </u>  and identify those &ldquo;micro-moments&rdquo; that matter most.

The cunning idea, or the strategy, is THE single thing that will make the most significant difference to the commercial performance of a practice.</p><p> At its most simple level strategy could be defined as &ldquo;my cunning idea to achieve superiority&rdquo;.  That&rsquo;s what it is all about in reality: it is how one is going to achieve better or superior results compared to others in the same market.  Strategy isn&rsquo;t the goal, which is a common misconception.  A strategy is the primary concept that will lead to achieving the goal.  The goal is simply the end result which will be achieved if the strategy was successfully executed.</p><p> Even though many professionals SAY they understand the differences between these concepts, and that they really truly know what strategy is, it seems they struggle to express what their own business strategy is. Of those who can express their strategy without having to refer to the planning document that was filed away last year after the full days planning session with the partners, a whiteboard and an expensive consultant (but which hasn&rsquo;t been look at again since), the strategy is more often than not meaningless drivel, such as:</p><p> &ldquo;We adopt a business mindset to succeed&ldquo;.</p><h3> Seriously.  That is a particular professional services firm&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;.  Apparently.</h3><p> <br/> This type of strategic statement is worse than useless.  It potentially confuses people within the organisation which is bad enough, however it is also dangerous because it is a navel-gazing strategy.  That is, it turns the focus inwards within the firm, and away from the marketplace. Great strategy has an outward focus that centres upon engaging with the target market or commercial opportunity, and gives guidance on how the firm will choose to compete to achieve its goals.</p><p> Great strategy assists people within the firm to determine how best to use resources, time and effort to compete or differentiate by delivering value.</p><p> Delivering value is what it is all about isn&rsquo;t it? If a service firm is delivering value successfully then it will prosper. If it does so exceptionally well then it will achieve superior results in comparison to the market.</p><h3> So perhaps the better question to have asked at the beginning is:</h3><p> <br/> What&rsquo;s the cunning plan for delivering exceptional value to our target market this year?</p><p> I am willing to bet that if you do have a cunning plan that is focused upon delivering exceptional value in the area where your firm wishes to compete, and if the cunning plan is executed well, then your firm will have an awesome year.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 21:22:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 21:22:18.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_aJqIV8k.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-have-a-cunning-plan/\", \"post_id\": \"8507\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 21:22:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 21:22:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-have-a-cunning-plan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8503\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4016\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Winning-the-\\u201cMicro-Moments\\u201d-in-Financial-Services-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"745\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452520800,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

And that was on a major currency.</p><p> For people who happen to come from more exotic countries, the price is even higher.</p><p> If you hail from Costa Rica, for example, these airport guys won&rsquo;t exchange Costa Rican colons into Australian dollars.</p><p> So you first have to exchange colons for US dollars in Costa Rica (and pay some overpriced exchange rate), and then once again change US dollars for Aussie dollars at a 7% markup once you land in Australia.</p><p> This is such an incredible scam, one of many that exists in the global financial system.</p><h3> One of my favorite financial scams is in sending wire transfers.</h3><p> <br/> Banks will often say things like, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;ll take 3-5 days for the money to arrive in the recipient&rsquo;s account. . .&rdquo;</p><p> What??!? These people act like they&rsquo;re loading up some kid with a satchel full of cash on the Pony Express to gallop across the country to deliver your money.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a complete scam. Wire transfers take place almost instantaneously.</p><p> As we discussed yesterday, our modern financial system is nothing more than a series of accounting entries held in a computer database somewhere.</p><p> So when you transfer funds from one bank to another, all the banks do is make small annotations in a giant database.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t take 3-5 days. It takes about 3-5 seconds. They just want to hang on to your money for a few days without having to pay you interest.</p><p> This is the nature of the entire financial system. Banks and financial institutions never miss an opportunity to screw the little guy in order to benefit themselves.</p><p> Hardly a month goes by without some major multinational bank pleading guilty to some sort of criminal charges&ndash; fixing exchange rates, colluding to fix interest rates, manipulating commodities prices, selling customers out to high-frequency traders&hellip;</p><p> There is a consistent pattern in finance of willfully violating the trust that the public places in these institutions.</p><p> And when they royally screw up and make idiotic investment decisions with our deposits, the taxpayers are forced to bail them out so they can start all over again.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s an absurd cycle. But the good news is that it&rsquo;s coming to an end.</h3><p> <br/> Banks were once vital middlemen who were necessary to facilitate commerce.</p><p> If you had extra savings, you went to a bank to deposit it. If you needed capital, you went to a bank to ask for a loan.</p><p> This is the way it has been for over seven centuries&ndash; banks have stood in the middle of that transaction because savers and borrowers had no way to access one another.</p><h3> This is no longer the case.</h3><p> <br/> Our modern technology now makes it possible for people across the world to gather and organize online.</p><p> And this means that nearly every single function of a bank can now be conducted cheaper, faster, and more efficiently through digital technology.</p><p> If you want to borrow money, you no longer need to go to a bank.</p><p> There are dozens of peer-to-peer lending platforms where you can borrow money for just about anything&ndash; starting a new business, buying a home, and even consumer purchases.</p><p> And with the advent of services like Google Wallet, Apple Pay, and especially Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain technology, you no longer need a bank to deposit money; it can all be stored digitally on your mobile phone.</p><p> You can exchange currencies and send money around the world without a bank, quickly and inexpensively through websites like TransferWise and Azimo.</p><p> Everything that a bank does&ndash; investing your money, processing credit card transactions, etc. can now be conducted outside of the banking system.</p><p> All of this technology already exists. These &ldquo;fintech&rdquo; or financial technology companies are already out there.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s merely a question of how quickly the technology will be adopted.</h3><p> <br/> 20 years ago few people had ever heard of the Internet. Today we can&rsquo;t imagine our lives without it.</p><p> I expect the adoption of financial technology will occur much more rapidly.</p><p> This is great news. The current financial system is in precarious condition. Banks are incredibly overleveraged and undercapitalized. Governments are bankrupt. Central banks are nearly insolvent.</p><p> The entire system is a house of cards held up by a very thin layer of confidence.</p><p> But one of the great lessons of history is that no matter how much the people in charge screw up, human beings always rise.</p><p> We adapt. We create solutions. And we clear out the old system with something better.</p><h3> That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening now. We&rsquo;re in the early stages of an amazing, transformative process.

Social media is taking over marketing. Further, the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/robo-platforms-are-missing-personality/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   robots  </a> </u> &rdquo; are also storm trooping the industry in how financial advice is provided and how investments are managed.</h3>The reality is that many parts of the financial advice process and investment management are becoming a commodity. As a consequence, many in the financial advisory business could suffer as a consequence of this move away from the traditional view of financial advice.However, you can take advantage of this shift to increase your practice. The key to success is to differentiate your service model from other financial advisors and the increasing array of online resources and systems. The number one strategy for financial advisors is right under your nose at the initial step of the financial advice process. That is to have a much deeper understanding of your client&rsquo;s needs and related <u> <a href=\"https://financialdna.com/behavioral-biases/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  behavioral finance </a></u> biases, and to directly involve the client in the discovery process to increase engagement. Inadequate 5 to 20 question assessments that address only risk&rsquo; won&rsquo;t cut it anymore. Neither will guess who the client is. Clients should be given the opportunity to participate in the completion of a comprehensive process which then enables the advisor to comprehensively know their client and their life journey.As the new landscape for advisors evolves, you don&rsquo;t have to bemoan it. If you adapt, you can seize this as an opportunity to actually grow your business. Look at the areas of the advisory process that can and should be commoditized. Leverage these technical platforms so that you and your team spend less time on investment management. Educate them, not only on the technology and investments, but more importantly, on how their approach to finances, investments and money can move clients towards achieving their life goals. The key starting point is to holistically identify the client&rsquo;s <u> <a href=\"https://financialdna.com/fdna-natural-behavior/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial personality </a></u>. Then use those insights to help clients manage their behavioral biases to prevent setbacks or missed opportunities and further grow their nest egg to achieve their goals.It&rsquo;s time for financial advisors to recognize that clients don&rsquo;t have to be lost to the new world order of do-it-yourself&rsquo; financial planning. Those financial advisors who have long ago invested in building relationships based on knowing their clients, knowing the plans they have for their lives, knowing and being a part of strategizing their financial roadmap to achieve their goals will not lose clients and actually grow their business.<h3> Here are 7 practical tips:</h3><li> <strong>  Use an independently developed and robust questionnaire based discovery process with clients at the point of entry and at annual reviews with existing clients. </strong> This will give you a clear insight into what they want to do with their finances.</li><li> <strong>  Focus on goals-based life planning and the financial plan to achieve those goals. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Take the mystery out of investing. </strong> Proactively build areas in your advisory process where clients can manage their investments for themselves. This will keep them connected with you as their &lsquo;go-to guy.&rsquo; Be a source of knowledge for the client.</li><li> <strong>  Build trust. </strong> Get to know how much clients understand markets and then educate them around the gaps (this builds trust.)

{"original_id":3875,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Trends Guaranteed to Impact Financial Services PR in 2016","link":"4-trends-guaranteed-to-impact-financial-services-pr-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  Ben Cooper </u></p><h3> Every winter season brings another round of resolutions for the New Year. In the PR world, the resetting of calendars provides agencies representing financial services firms with an opportunity to reevaluate their communications strategies.</h3><p> <br/> PR strategies capitalized on a slew of different trends in 2015 varying from the growing presence of robo advisors to regulatory developments concerning the extension of the fiduciary standard. 2016, however, will undoubtedly come with a fresh set of challenges and opportunities for communications firms to reenergize their approach. To be successful, it is important to identify the forces shaping the financial services landscape and use them to your advantage.</p><p> As we&rsquo;ve  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/bringing-the-ria-regulatory-and-political-heat-to-south-beach/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussed  </a> </u>  in this blog before, now is the time for financial services PR firms to think ahead and position themselves to better communicate their clients&rsquo; stories to the media and broader industry audiences.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  financial services team leaders put their heads together to identify several areas of opportunity slated to emerge in the upcoming year and suggestions as to how to manage a successful PR campaign in 2016.</p><h3> 1. Fine tuning your social media strategy</h3><p> <br/> Social media adoption has skyrocketed throughout the financial services industry. For years now, RIAs have been  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/top-financial-pr-firm-perspective-the-state-of-social-media-for-ria-firms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  utilizing social media </a>  strategies to better communicate with current clients and connect with potential new ones. It also helps advisors stay in touch with their industry while providing a platform to demonstrate thought leadership and increase overall awareness of the firm.However, merely signing up for Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook isn&rsquo;t enough to add meaningful value to a PR campaign. Financial services companies and their public relations representation must tailor their strategies by placing a varying emphasis on each specific social media platform. For example, institutional investors and other business-to-business firms will receive limited benefit from a Facebook presence. However, LinkedIn offers a very effective platform for demonstrating thought leadership to relevant audiences within their industry. Similarly, a post to Twitter, which is flooded with content throughout each day, might not pack as much punch as a post to more stagnant outlets like Facebook or LinkedIn. Twitter requires additional monitoring and frequent posting to ensure your content is reaching the desired audience. Similarly, you would never double-post to Instagram or LinkedIn. Familiarize yourself with the intricacies of each platform and cater your strategy accordingly. As a PR firm, revisit your social media strategy to make sure your content, and how you promote it, hasn&rsquo;t gone stale. Read posts and follow others within the industry to ensure your social presence is evolving at a breakneck pace.</p><h3> 2. Infiltrating industry &ldquo;influencers&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Non-journalist members of the media carry weight in the financial services industry more than ever. The evolution of social media has allowed industry experts to build followings stronger and with wider reaches than many publications. CFPs  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelKitces\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Kitces  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillWinterberg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bill Winterberg  </a> </u>  are both great examples. The two have tens of thousands of Twitter followers and subscribers to their research, blogs and YouTube video channels. &ldquo;Influencers&rdquo; like Winterberg and Kitces seamlessly blast a wide range of content to a massive audience of financial journalists and money-managing professionals. They constantly interact with viewers and are masters of building and demonstrating thought leadership on social media. Many viewers get their news from these guys and care deeply about what they have to say. Also, influencers are always looking for fresh content and constantly share other bloggers&rsquo; posts. Interact with them and build a relationship to get on their radar. Getting a share from a prominent &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; on social media will open up your exposure to a whole new demographic of your targeted audience.</p><h3> 3. Trumping election coverage</h3><p> <br/> Media coverage of the 2016 presidential election has thus far been unprecedented. The explosion of coverage, mostly thanks to Donald Trump, creates an enormous opportunity for PR professionals to integrate their clients&rsquo; stories into the news cycle. Big-name publications like Bloomberg, Politico and CNN are  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/2016-campaigns-are-beefing-up-staffs-so-are-the-media-who-will-cover-them/2015/02/23/9f1d2152-a66b-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   beefing up  </a> </u>  their newsrooms with additional reporters and editors to accommodate additional election coverage needs. While headlines documenting feuds between candidates may appear to garner most of the attention, business outlets are still very tuned in to how each candidate will impact different industries and the overall economy. As the election nears, discuss with clients where they fall on varying issues like the extension of the DOL&rsquo;s fiduciary standard and changes to tax or Social Security laws. Figure out which matters they feel passionately about and whether they are comfortable discussing their opinions with the media. It is normally unwise for a financial professional to go as far as endorsing a candidate, but  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thenewshackers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NewsHacking  </a> </u>  your way into election coverage can demonstrate thought leadership, gain exposure and heighten awareness of the firm.</p><h3> 4. Contributing as a contributor</h3><p> Take your clients&rsquo; visibility to the next level by placing them in the media as contributors. More news outlets are opening up to the idea of submitted bylined articles written by financial services professionals. Placing your clients&rsquo; name underneath the headline demonstrates respected thought leadership and boosts their credibility to investors and journalists. Also, many outlets feature recurring contributions from the same author. Joe Duran, CEO of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  client  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.unitedcp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   United Capital  </a> </u> , offers his perspective on issues facing the RIA industry on a biweekly basis to InvestmentNews&rsquo; thousands of viewers. Duran&rsquo;s posts garner hundreds of shares on social media and provide the client with exposure to an entirely new audience within the industry. PR professionals need to proactively build relationships with journalists to secure contributor placements and encourage clients to participate in recurring contributor opportunities before a competing firm fills the open spot.</p><p> In terms of what else 2016 will have in store, that&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess. But successfully navigating the four trends outlined above will be essential to any successful financial services PR campaign in 2016. The crystal ball never lies.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-10 22:56:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-10 22:56:45.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_GnatEP3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-trends-guaranteed-to-impact-financial-services-pr-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8513\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-10 22:56:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-10 22:56:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-trends-guaranteed-to-impact-financial-services-pr-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8512\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4019\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Trends-Guaranteed-to-Impact-Financial-Services-PR-in-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"606\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452519000,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3876,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Reach Executive Women Investors","link":"how-to-reach-executive-women-investors","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Ultra-high-net-worth, yet surprisingly under-served</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Emerging market&rdquo; may seem like a strange term to apply to high-net-worth women. They have long controlled as much wealth as men, and as Figure 1 demonstrates, all projections point to the fact that women will control an overwhelming majority of investable assets in the not-too-distant future. Yet financial advisors have largely ignored this group &ndash; until rather recently. Credit for the particular characterization as an emerging market goes to Sally Krawcheck, co-founder of Ellevate Network and a former president of Global Wealth and Investment Management for Bank of America, who says the financial services industry has cut itself off from the trillions of dollars in women&rsquo;s wealth. 2  Given the recent proliferation of studies and articles pointing out financial advisors&rsquo; shortcomings in attracting and retaining this audience, and their consequent awakening to the importance of this clientele, the description seems apt.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-11-at-9.00.02-AM-2.png\" width=\"470\"/></p><p> Ultra-high-net-worth women, whether they qualify by means of inheritance or earnings, are obviously potential clients to the advisory community. Given their growing importance in the world of wealthy individuals &ndash; and the fact that they have not been extensively courted &ndash; executive women should be a particular focus for advisors to expand their current and future business pipeline. You can build a relationship by recognizing what makes executive women unique as clients &ndash; and then capitalizing on those differences. </p><h3> <strong>  They have different priorities than men </strong></h3><p> <br/> Industry wisdom concurs that much of the &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo; many financial advisors experience with women investors is because the traditionally male-dominated profession is insensitive to some major gender differences when it comes to money. This disconnect has been reflected in recent statistics showing women often change their financial advisor within one year of a spouse&rsquo;s death; some estimates even run as high as 70 percent. 3</p><p> The reason? Historically wealth acceleration has not been a priority for women. Rather, they value asset preservation, focusing on caring for family, work/life balance and, importantly, living comfortably in retirement, which on average lasts longer than that of most men due to their likely increased lifespan (a major concern for many women investors).</p><h3> <strong>  They have different priorities than other women </strong></h3><p> <br/> A study by Spectrem Group revealed, somewhat surprisingly, that executive women are less likely to have children or grandchildren, undoubtedly because they have dedicated themselves to their careers. That same study also showed the primary concern for executive women is similar to the broader affluent population: the well-being of their family members. However, for executive women those family members tend to be children (if they have them) and aging parents, not a spouse. 4</p><h3> <strong>  They seek an Advisor's expertise above and beyond their own proficiency </strong></h3><p> <br/> Highly affluent professional women are more knowledgeable about financial products &mdash; threequarters self-describe as very or fairly knowledgeable on investing.4 Yet even though 38 percent claim they want &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; autonomy in investment decisions, women making in excess of $200,000 per year are exceptional candidates for advisory services. Why? Data has shown that the &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; they seek is more of a desire for expert advice that includes overall financial planning and a reluctance to be steered toward specific investment products. 4</p><h3> <strong>  They are comfortable with risk </strong></h3><p> <br/> Contrary to popular belief, women are not as risk averse as once thought. Studies show that affluent women investors actually tend to take more risks, but do so more cautiously. These women are more comfortable taking risks than most investors (more than 50 percent compared to approximately 33 percent of the broader affluent group), but with the caveat that they fully understand the risks they are taking.4 They do their homework and place emphasis on fully understanding the risks before executing any opportunity. Executive women in this high earnings group are comfortable with alternative investments, commodities and real estate; are three times more likely to invest in hedge funds, venture capital and private equity; and twice as likely to invest in commodities and precious metals. 4</p><h3> <strong>  They expect you to text </strong></h3><p> <br/> At an average 50 years old, executive women are much younger than the broader affluent population who average 63 years of age. Ninety-three percent are college grads and 63 percent have advanced degrees, as opposed to 73 percent and 39 percent, respectively, of the broader affluent population. They also tend to be very technically savvy and frequent users of social media &mdash; and they are more likely to text with their financial advisor. 5</p><h3> <strong>  So where to begin? Listen to their goals, both financial and personal </strong></h3><p> <br/> Learning how to communicate with women about their money is critical to success. Doing business the &ldquo;old way&rdquo; or spouting industry jargon and portfolio performance to impress potential female clients with knowledge and expertise will not win the day. Listening rather than talking is a trait women value in an advisor. Developing a holistic relationship that addresses life and family goals along with personal concerns will help create and sustain a successful business relationship. No matter the source or sample, every study of high-earning executive women agrees: women in this group are all dealing with the one limited resource we all share &mdash; time. They are consumed by a demanding job, the needs of family members and the nearly impossible task of attending to their own future needs. Savvy advisors are recognizing that focusing on just financial advice is sometimes not enough. Building a lasting relationship is key and should include both concern and solutions for the issues these women face on a daily basis. While these women are champion outsourcers, they may not necessarily have thought out the consequences of continuing their supporting roles after the paychecks stop. For instance, adding professional healthcare and health insurance advisory may be critical for certain clients. Asking the right questions will initiate the right conversations. Is the long-term disability coverage from their business enough? What about long-term care insurance? If there are children in the picture, are college costs covered? Is elder care an issue? Do parents live nearby or are remote check-in and assistance needed? Only by understanding her total situation can an advisor begin to form a cohesive plan to meet her financial goals. As one successful advisor put it, &ldquo;Many executive women have spent their lives ensuring everyone else&rsquo;s oxygen mask is secured first. Advisors who have the patience, empathy and courage to sift through what matters most to these women and help them create a plan for success are likely to have clients for life &mdash; and the referral flow to make all the time spent worthwhile.&rdquo; 6</p><p> Learn more about Flexshares <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-exec-women-investors-post-32516\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>1 Robinson, Tom.

{"original_id":3877,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Walk the Walk for Business Success","link":"how-to-walk-the-walk-for-business-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Operating a small business and navigating through the many changes that have to be made requires a set of skills. Some of these skills you already have, and some need to be gathered via additional staff or training.</p><p> There are numerous suggested skills or components required for successful change. While they seem basic and simple, like &ldquo;vision,&rdquo; and &ldquo;incentives,&rdquo; one or two of these may get lost in the shuffle and if you&rsquo;re minus just one of these components, dysfunction occurs, and change may not be made, may be delayed, but definitely, profits will be lost.</p><h3> For example, take stock of your business inventory</h3><p> <br/> One big time taker, which sometimes makes us lose sight of the important stuff, is what I call &ldquo;fighting the alligators,&rdquo; or the day to day demands of the job, leaving little room for another term I like to use, which is &ldquo;cleaning the swamp.&rdquo;</p><p> To that end, take an inventory of your business:</p><li> Do you have enough excellent staff?</li><li> Have you instituted quality and security practices?</li><li> Have you developed financial, marketing and operational plans to avoid short term crises?</li><li> I cannot tell you many clients fail to consider &ldquo;operations&rdquo; or the practical running of the business, and end up short of inventory or short of cash because sales did not develop fast enough. <br/>  </li><p> Similarly, we tend to be very comfortable in our regular habits and reluctant to try new things. New managers, who are presumably hired to bring new ideas to the table, frequently make expansive changes before looking at simple solutions. I&rsquo;ve heard story after story about businesses that waste so much time in meetings, committees, and reading e-mails.  <strong>  One client recently shared that that they had formed a committee to study how to reduce committees!! Yikes. </strong></p><p> In considering change, we need to remember that new approaches are not permanent, and that any new testing can be tweaked or even abandoned at any time. The opportunities for using the internet to test, and then adapt, are extremely significant &ndash; there is virtually no risk, but the returns can turn the tide on whether you make that business change or not.</p><h3> Walking the walk is also frequently dependent on suppliers, financial sources, and consultants</h3><p> <br/> What do you do if you have suppliers, financial sources, or consultants who basically commit and then don&rsquo;t deliver? While optimism &ndash; yours or theirs &mdash; may be the cause, failure still results in missed plans or crucial deadlines. The best solutions are to use reliable or tested resources, get references, have written plans, and develop contingencies. Don&rsquo;t forget to measure and evaluate results, and then adapt or find new resources, as recommended.</p><h3> Probably, the most important aspect of walking the walk is everyday behavior. <br/>  </h3><li> Most impressions are made within 30-60 seconds, and we sometimes overemphasize content and ignore appearance, training, perceptions, presentation, and simple courtesy.</li><li> The most important is showing respect in our communications.

{"original_id":3878,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Innovate: Create a Conversation, Not a Presentation","link":"how-to-innovate-create-a-conversation-not-a-presentation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When tapping your company&rsquo;s brain trust to come up with new ways to tackle problems or innovate new products or services, what&rsquo;s the best way to move forward? If you&rsquo;re thinking about brainstorming, you&rsquo;ve got a lot of company. However, I believe that while the concept of brainstorming is a good one, the traditional process should be reworked. How many of you have been in brainstorming sessions when brains were actually storming&hellip; my guess is very few.</p><h3> The Traditional Approach is Broken</h3><p> <br/> Brainstorming sessions traditionally gather a handful of an organization&rsquo;s best thinkers in the same room, give them an objective and see what shakes out of the conversation. There are two problems with this approach. One is borne out of dominant personalities. If you have a room of ten employees, for example, there will always be one or two who jump into the fray with their ideas and expand on them, giving others little or no time to float ideas of their own. Some people just like to spout off and grab ownership of the conversation.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve seen the type&mdash;they like to hear themselves talk, and will make a whole presentation out of their one idea, effectively hijacking the session. Others may have something more brilliant to contribute, but might be reticent and easily put off by conversation hogs. Plus, when one person is doing most of the talking in a group, everyone else is concentrating on what they&rsquo;re saying (or tuning them out) and are not coming up with ideas of their own.</p><p> The second problem is that our minds are biased by first impressions. The first statements made in a group conversation tend to color the decisions and evaluations of the rest of the group&mdash;a process psychologists call  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/05/the-anchoring-effect-how-the-mind-is-biased-by-first-impressions.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   anchoring  </a> </u> . So let&rsquo;s say your conversation hog blurts out the first thing that comes to mind to look smart at the beginning of the session. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t dominate the rest of the conversation, the rest of the group will tend to waste time thinking about that first idea, whether it&rsquo;s a good one or not&mdash;and it will color the rest of the discussion. Even without a conversation hog in the group, the first ideas tend to be low-hanging fruit to get things started&mdash;not a good anchoring point for developing bigger and better ideas.</p><h3> Give Everyone&rsquo;s Ideas More Play</h3><p> <br/> A good way around these issues is to change the rules of the game. You can avoid the problems of anchoring and conversation hogs by giving everyone at the table a chance to think in their own space and write down their ideas beforeopening group discussion, something called &ldquo;brainwriting.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a new concept. In May of 2000, University of Texas Psychology Professor Paul B. Paulus wrote in the Academic Pressabout brainstorming in a paper entitled  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/cos/paulus/pub/IdeaGeneration.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Idea Generation in Groups: A Basis for Creativity in Organizations  </a> </u> , and a recent Fast Companyarticle,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3033567/agendas/brainstorming-doesnt-work-try-this-technique-instead\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brainstorming Doesn&rsquo;t Work; Try This Technique Instead  </a> </u> , also discusses it.</p><p> The Fast Company article explains that brainwriting is a more systematic way of getting everyone&rsquo;s ideas down on paper (or a whiteboard). Doing this before or at the very beginning of a meeting and putting all ideas on the table for discussion eliminates the problems with social dynamics and gives the group more to work with. It can be as simple as having everyone jot down their ideas on 3&times;5 cards, or more advanced by using apps like  <u>  <a href=\"http://usecandor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Candor  </a> </u>  to record participants&rsquo; thoughts before the meeting and screen out repetitive ideas.</p><p> Numbers from the Fast Company article indicate that brainwriting can generate 20% more ideas and 42% more original ideas than traditional brainstorming groups. When it comes to innovating, you need as many ideas in the till as possible, and the ability and freedom to work together as a group to create something new.</p><h3> Quantity and Variety = Better Outcomes</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s the conversation side of brainstorming that produces the fruit. Once people start chewing on these ideas and putting their brains together to create and collaborate&mdash;that&rsquo;s where the magic happens. So if you&rsquo;re frustrated by the results of your brainstorming sessions, consider changing the process. Brainwriting can help eliminate problems that reduce idea flow, such as anchoring and pontificating. It also gives brainstormers a bigger variety of ideas to work with and more time to converse with each other to play with those ideas and turn them into something great.</p><p> When Brainstorming Innovation&hellip; create a Conversation, &ldquo;not&rdquo; a Presentation.  <u>  <a href=\"http://returnonrelationship.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #RonR  </a> </u> &hellip;  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/so-what-is-noletup/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #NoLetUp!  </a> </u></p><p> This originally posted on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   TedRubin  </u> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-11 18:01:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-11 18:01:36.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_p8gmEvZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-innovate-create-a-conversation-not-a-presentation/\", \"post_id\": \"8520\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-11 18:01:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-11 18:01:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-innovate-create-a-conversation-not-a-presentation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8519\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4022\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Innovate-Create-a-Conversation-Not-a-Presentation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"699\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452596400,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

I Feel Your Pain!","link":"generation-x-i-feel-your-pain","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Generation X has some problems&mdash;and not just their own. Perhaps the biggest one of all is that this group has everyone else&rsquo;s problems too!</h3><p> <br/> On one hand, they&rsquo;re dealing with aging parents. On the other hand, they have young kids, college-aged kids, or adult kids who are moving back home or need financial support because they can&rsquo;t find a decent job post-college. And all this is happening right when stressed-out GenXers are in mid-career and trying desperately to build their own net worth.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re in your late 30s, 40s, or early 50s, you know the scenario well. Your career is in full swing, and even if you are making a great salary, it seems money is just flying out the door. If you have kids, they&rsquo;re more expensive than ever (who knew $100 cell phone bills, iPhones, laptops, and SAT prep camps would be part of the newparenting equation?) and college  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/why-college-costs-are-so-high-and-rising.html\" target=\"_blank\">  costs are skyrocketing </a>  more each year. Your house is another story. Even if you were lucky enough to purchase a home (or at least refinance) in today&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fixed-mortgage-rates-move-lower-2015-10-22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   low interest rate environment  </a> </u> , you&rsquo;re still paying a higher percentage of your income than previous generations toward housing. And if you&rsquo;ve been in the same place for a while, renovations can throw another blow to your budget. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. You are the &ldquo;sandwich generation.&rdquo; Your parents are aging&hellip;and they need your help. According to the Pew Research Center, about one in seven GenXers is providing financial support to both a child and an aging parent. From helping your parents through illnesses, to getting them set up on Medicare, finding great assisted care, selling their real estate, and more, the tasks you have to tackle seem endless.</p><p> It&rsquo;s exhausting just thinking about it. As an advisor, one of my most important roles is helping my GenX clients juggle these overwhelming responsibilities today while also planning for the future. Because no matter how mired you are in today&rsquo;s challenges, your own retirement could be an even bigger problem&mdash;unless you plan well today. To help make the juggling as easy as possible (let&rsquo;s face it: it will never be easy!), here are my top five tips for getting through the &ldquo;sandwich generation dilemma&rdquo; with your sanity in tact:</p><h3> 1. Take care of yourself first. </h3><p> <br/> With so much responsibility for others, it&rsquo;s easy to forget to take care of you. But just like we&rsquo;re told to put on our own oxygen mask first before helping others, it&rsquo;s vital that you keep yourself healthy too. Get your annual physical. Get a flu shot. And see your medical team when something isn&rsquo;t quite right. These are the years when preventive care makes a huge difference in your health today (so you can take care of everyone else) and helps to ensure your wellbeing as you age.</p><h3> 2. Start thinking about how you want to define &ldquo;retirement.&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> Unlike your parents, you probably don&rsquo;t see yourself retiring at 62. You expect to live a longer, healthier life, and you may be planning to keep working much later or start a second or even third career&mdash;something that invigorates you and keeps you socially, intellectually, and physically active later in life. You want to play by your own rules, but that takes money. Which leads us to&hellip;</p><h3> 3. Invest in yourself now so you can buy your independence and dignity later. </h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s face it: money is the key to independence. Once you&rsquo;re ready to move on from your current career, you&rsquo;ll want to have the assets to support your &ldquo;non-retirement&rdquo; dreams in the future.  Whether investing in yourself means earning an advanced degree, nurturing a talent, or simply putting a percentage of today&rsquo;s salary into a &ldquo;next career&rdquo; bucket, being proactive now can help you make your dreams come true down the road.</p><h3> 4. Lower your stress by getting your financial &ldquo;house&rdquo; in order. </h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re like most GenXers, your finances could be in better shape, in part because you&rsquo;re money is so tied up in everything from your kids&rsquo; college tuition to your parents&rsquo; medical bills. That might be why 68% of GenXers report that they don&rsquo;t have a good handle on cash flow, 53% don&rsquo;t pay off their credit cards regularly, and 23% pay late fees. While changing this behavior may feel like one more thing to add to your to-do list, it will save you time&mdash;and stress&mdash;in the long run.</p><h3> 5. Keep an eye on your endgame. </h3><p> <br/> Yes, all this juggling can feel overwhelming, but it&rsquo;s vital that you attack your finances with gusto as soon as possible. Don&rsquo;t just get your parent&rsquo;s estate documents squared away&mdash;tackle your own as well. Make sure your money is working for you every day, and be sure you have adequate insurance in place to protect your assets and your family. Just like taking care of your health, making your finances a top priority can help lower your stress, give you more time to spend with your family, and ensure you have the financial strength to keep all those balls in the air.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-11 18:39:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-11 18:39:18.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_uyqnMD7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/generation-x-i-feel-your-pain/\", \"post_id\": \"8523\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-11 18:39:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-11 18:39:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"generation-x-i-feel-your-pain\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8521\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4024\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/I\\u2019m-Not-Able-To-Do-That.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"486\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452610800,"author_id":341,"chart_url":""}

Let&rsquo;s break it down:<li> <strong>  Like everything else, you need to define why your dream is so darned important. </strong> Until you get that solved, you are likely going nowhere fast.</li><li> <strong>  Now that you know WHY, get a handle on your NOW. </strong> Kenny Rogers had a hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0-7fg8oAO4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   song  </u> </a> &ldquo;Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In.&rdquo; What condition is your condition in?</li><li> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re like most people, your condition needs anywhere from a little cleaning up to a major overhaul. </strong> Now is the time to be factual. No excuses, just the facts.</li><li> <strong>  Assess your Money Mindset. </strong> How do you think about money? Is it a tool to accomplish your goal? Is it a burden? Do you associate money with problems? Do you see money as a way of obtaining security?</li><li> <strong>  If money is a struggle, get help. </strong> Whether it&rsquo;s a counselor, therapist, coach or planner, work with someone who can assist you in helping you get on the right path.</li><li> <strong>  Once you are on the right path, acknowledge the habits that are aligned with your end desires and keep doing them. </strong> For example, if you are adding to your wealth by creating automatic investments, then keep doing it AND see where you can increase your contributions. If you are eliminating debt by making a payment every time you get paid, keep going and look for areas where you can cut your spending to increase your pay down.</li><li> <strong>  Appreciate your progress. </strong> While the big goals are there, each step forward is a reason to feel really good about your progress.</li><li> <strong>  Reaching viral status means consistently making decisions that make a difference. </strong> Each success breeds the next success until you&rsquo;ve built meaningful momentum.</li><li> <strong>  Bumps in the road are normal. Setbacks, mistakes and the unexpected happen. </strong> Think of being on a diet and being really disciplined and losing ten pounds. Then you meet a cookie that lures you into its delicious trap and you fall in. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve failed, it just means that tomorrow is a new opportunity to reset your plan. It&rsquo;s the same with your money. You might have a slip, but only you can pick yourself up and get back on track.</li><h3> Imagine yourself in viral mode.</h3>You are happy with your plan, your actions and the outcomes most important to you in your life. Now keep that image firmly in your head and use it as fuel to get started on making your dreams your new reality.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-11 18:43:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-11 18:43:48.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_6xdfkia.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/getting-your-finances-to-go-viral/\", \"post_id\": \"8525\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-11 18:43:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-11 18:43:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"getting-your-finances-to-go-viral\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8524\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4025\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Getting-Your-Finances-To-Go-Viral.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"426\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452607200,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

I will never forget how Julia appeared on that stage, waiting to begin.  She did not want to be there and made it clear.  The question was, why?  I had done this enough to know that I shouldn&rsquo;t impose my own meaning on what I was seeing.  When someone is in an uncomfortable situation, it brings out a side that&rsquo;s hard to interpret if you don&rsquo;t know the person.  All I knew was, to be in your mid-thirties and already a Senior Vice President of a fairly large organization, is quite a feat.  I was curious to know more.</p><p> She didn&rsquo;t participate much, the morning of the session.  She listened.  Intently.  She didn&rsquo;t make eye contact, but I could see her wheels spinning.  Questioning.  Debating.  Scrutinizing the conversation in her head.  What was she thinking?  It was hard to know.</p><p> During lunch, as we were all sitting around the table, she looked conflicted.  Something was up, and I couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was.</p><p> &ldquo;Julia?&rdquo; I asked gently, &ldquo;are you okay?&rdquo;</p><h3> For the first time that day, she looked me right in the eye and, like a release valve going off, said forcefully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a leader, if I have to be like the other leaders at my company!&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve heard this same thing or something similar.  Countless.  And it makes sense.  For years and years organizations thrived at the hands of leaders who mastered the ability to command and control.  But it&rsquo;s a new world and it requires a new kind of leadership.  What worked back then, isn&rsquo;t having the same result.  Great talent is no longer willing to hang out with bullies in the boardroom in exchange for a paycheck.  They know they have options or can create options.  And they will.  And they do.</p><h3> Great talent is no longer willing to hang out with bullies in the boardroom in exchange for a paycheck.  They know they have options.</h3><p> <br/> The challenge is, with the traditional leadership-mold no longer working, what are leaders to do?  I would love to tell you that there is a magic pill, or 15-steps that you can memorize to make people want to follow you, but it just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.  As much as we love them, there is no cookie-cutter-approach.  You see, while people may realize they have tofollow, you can&rsquo;t make people want to follow, that&rsquo;s something they get to choose.  To want, comes from the heart and is an individual choice.  Do the people you lead want to follow?</p><h3> While people may realize they have to follow, you can&rsquo;t make people want to follow, that&rsquo;s something they get to choose.  </h3><p> <br/> At the end of the day, a tearful, joyful Julia stood on the stage and shared what she stood for as a leader.  Her own version of leadership.  &ldquo;I am a leader!&rdquo; she declared triumphantly, &ldquo;and this is why&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> One of my favorite quotes:</p><p> &ldquo;You must love those you lead before you can be an effective leader. You can certainly command without that sense of commitment, but you cannot lead without it. And without leadership, command is a hollow experience, a vacuum often filled with mistrust and arrogance.&rdquo; &ndash;  General Eric Shinseki, A 4-star-General, Army Chief of Staff (1999 &ndash; 2003), and US Secretary for Veterans Affairs (2009 &ndash; 14)</p><p> Several weeks later, I received an email from Julia.  She wrote to share a note she had received from a young manager on her team.  A note thanking her for making a difference &ndash; for seeing something in him that he hadn&rsquo;t seen.  &ldquo;The funny thing is, I didn&rsquo;t realize that the way I was leading was a positive thing, until we met,&rdquo; Julia said.  &ldquo;I always thought I was a bad leader, for not being like all the rest.\"  </p><h3> \"Now I can see that it&rsquo;s my differences that are my strengths.\"  </h3><p> <br/> \"The people on my team know I care and that&rsquo;s why they let me lead them.&rdquo;</p><p> As you continue on your leadership journey, I encourage you to explore what kind of leader you want to be.

{"original_id":3883,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What to Do When Independence Becomes Unprofitable","link":"what-to-do-when-independence-becomes-unprofitable","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> How RIAs Can Revive Their Struggling Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> The business of running an independent wealth management firm is an expensive one&mdash;and it is only going to become more expensive. With the changing regulatory environment, increased competition from an ever-expanding pool of RIAs and employee advisors, the rise of the robo, and fee compression, the need for scale has never been greater. Unfortunately, there are way too many barely profitable firms and as the principals of these firms look at their horizons, the smart ones will realize the need to align themselves with larger firms that already have scale, professional management, business development infrastructure, a succession plan and an equity structure that extends beyond a single founder/principal. An unprofitable firm that hitches its wagon to a more profitable one becomes the embodiment of the quote: &ldquo;A rising tide lifts all boats.&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, the market for unprofitable firms &ndash; even ones that are in growth mode &ndash; is slim&hellip;and it will get slimmer as the M&amp;A market heats up. In any scenario, the more motivated and flexible all parties are to a deal, the more likely it is to get done. But in the case of an unprofitable firm, managed expectations on the part of the seller is mission critical.</p><h3> Here are some things to keep in mind: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Most acquisitions are valued on a multiple of EBITDA. </strong> Obviously, in the case of an unprofitable or barely profitable seller, applying a multiple to zero wouldn&rsquo;t work. If a buyer is motivated to acquire an unprofitable firm because it is attracted to what that seller can add to its value proposition, then a multiple of post-acquisition EBITDA is usually used. (This takes into account elimination of redundant expenses, raising of fees and growth, then looks at the kind of profitability the selling firm would generate in a combined scenario.)</li><li> <strong>  Because the seller is currently unprofitable, the majority of the deal will be weighted on growth hurdles, earn outs and back-end bonuses. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The seller of an unprofitable firm doesn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of leverage even if he has a firm with solid growth potential and asset base. </strong></li><li> <strong>  If the seller values the ability to gain scale </strong> , a succession plan and accelerated growth more than he values up front cash and the most aggressive multiple, then he is much more likely to get a deal done (i.e., eliminating the pain points is more important than short term upside).</li><li> <strong>  While most industry thought leaders agree that standalone firms that lack scale and profitability will find it harder to thrive in today&rsquo;s environment </strong> , sellers who believe their profitability will increase in the natural order of things &ndash; by raising client fees, decreasing expenses and organic growth &ndash; should certainly stay the course until they can create more meaningful EBITDA. <br/>  </li><p> Take &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;, who is the principal of a $500mm fee-only RIA that generates approximately $4mm in annual revenues. The cost of doing business for an investment management firm with a 12-person research and analytical staff is exorbitant and as such, Bob&rsquo;s EBITDA is only $350,000. While Bob&rsquo;s low EBITDA is dragging down his enterprise value, he has built a great firm that services 150 high net worth clients. After years of trying to positively impact his profitability, he has decided to actively pursue a search for the right buyer that would generate meaningful cost and revenue synergies and offer a mechanism to accelerate growth. In the final analysis, Bob is deciding between two offers: one from a bank looking to grow its wealth management unit; the other from a larger and more profitable RIA that deploys a similar investment approach. While neither deal offers him much liquidity up front &ndash; and both will require Bob to grow and reduce expenses considerably before he sees any real benefits &ndash; he knows that monetizing in the short run is of much less importance at this stage than improving profitability. And he knows that the deal he consummates today will allow him to capture much greater enterprise value in the long run&mdash;rather than continuing down a path that is likely to become even more difficult and less profitable.</p><h3> While many wealth management firm principals embarked on the journey to independence for freedom, flexibility and control, they also expected a modicum of profitability to follow.</h3><p> <br/> Yet the landscape has become far more difficult terrain for many to traverse alone. Remapping your future with a mind open to M&amp;A can take stress off the day-to-day and allow you to get back to running the business you envisioned&mdash;with freedom, flexibility, control and greater profitability.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-11 19:15:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-11 19:15:27.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_KE8Facb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-to-do-when-independence-becomes-unprofitable/\", \"post_id\": \"8529\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-11 19:15:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-11 19:15:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-to-do-when-independence-becomes-unprofitable\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8528\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4027\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/What-to-Do-When-Independence-Becomes-Unprofitable.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"553\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452631500,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3884,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Why You'll Not Meet Your Goals This Year","link":"5-reasons-why-youll-not-meet-your-goals-this-year","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m an obsessive goal setter. For as long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve set goals at the start of every year. And reviewed them at the end.</p><h3> And for the most part, here&rsquo;s what I discovered: there isn&rsquo;t a single year where I managed to meet all my goals.</h3><p> <br/> But over time, I got better. Over time, I discovered there are some fundamental flaws in the way most of us set goals. Flaws that not only keep us from meeting our goals, but leave us frustrated and feeling like we fell short.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s a problem &ndash; because if you&rsquo;re a go-getter like me, you want to hit those goals. Not meeting them doesn&rsquo;t feel good. In fact, it feels downright bad.</p><p> Throughout the years, I played around with many aspects of my goalsetting routine. Set more goals. Less goals. Set long term goals. Short term ones. Set objectives instead of goals. Measure my goals. Leave them in a drawer for a year, and then look at what happened.</p><p> And over time, I started seeing five classic mistakes I was making in my goal setting &ndash; 5 mistakes that were setting me up to fail from the start.</p><h3> <strong>  #1. You don&rsquo;t set goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first mistake I see many people make is they don&rsquo;t set goals. By that, I don&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t try and set something &ndash; it&rsquo;s just not goals they&rsquo;re setting.</p><p> Many of us confuse goals with wishes, objectives, or &ldquo;nice to haves&rdquo;. Goals are specific. Wishes are fluffy. Goals are measureable. They&rsquo;re achievable, and realistic. They&rsquo;re concrete.</p><p> I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve set myself a &ldquo;stretch goal&rdquo;, only to discover that either there was no way I was going to meet that goal, or feel constantly frustrated by the amount of effort it took to actually keep me going.</p><p> I know that &ldquo;if you shoot for the moon, you&rsquo;ll land among the stars&rdquo;, but in reality, that&rsquo;s a pretty frustrating place to be.</p><p> Part of setting goals is to actually achieve them.</p><h3> <strong>  #2. You don&rsquo;t have a system in place </strong></h3><p> <br/> Setting goals is only the first step (and by far the easiest one). The tricky part is figuring out how you&rsquo;ll actually achieve them.</p><p> To do that, you&rsquo;ll need a system.</p><p> A system is something that allows you to:</p><li> <strong>  Break your goal down in actionable steps </strong></li><li> <strong>  Measure progress against those steps </strong></li><li> <strong>  Course correct if necessary </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Personally, I like using the GOAL method.</p><p> First, I set an overall Goal (&ldquo;I commit to generating ____ in revenue by December 31st of this year&rdquo;).</p><p> Then, I break that down into Objectives. I like using quarters, so I might include something like &ldquo;by the end of Q1, I commit to generating ____ in revenue&rdquo;, or &ldquo;by the end of Q1, I want to have ______ in my pipeline&rdquo;).</p><p> The next step is to turn that into Actions. I set actions for myself on a weekly basis. Examples of actions are things like &ldquo;This week, I want to send out _____ prospecting emails&rdquo; or &ldquo;This week, I want to have _____ prospecting calls&rdquo;).</p><p> The final step is Labor. Labor is all about identifying those tasks you must accomplish on a daily basis, like &ldquo;today, I&rsquo;m going to spend ____ hours prospecting&rdquo; or &ldquo;this morning, I&rsquo;m going to finish that proposal&rdquo;.</p><p> A system like this is cohesive: it links your daily Labor, weekly Actions, quarterly Objectives and annual Goals together.</p><p> Unless you&rsquo;ve got a system like this in place, you may well be setting goals, but you&rsquo;re unlikely to actually achieve them.</p><h3> <strong>  #3. You have no &ldquo;why&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sometimes, when I take on a coaching client, we&rsquo;ll review their goals together. As a part of that conversation, I&rsquo;ll ask them why they want to achieve a particular goal.</p><p> Often, I&rsquo;ll get a nicely crafted story about how important it is to the future of their firm, or how they want to become the #1 seller inside their company.</p><p> When I dig deeper, there&rsquo;s often an awkward silence.</p><p> Many of us set goals without having a clear &ldquo;why&rdquo;. Or we have others (like our sales manager) set goals for us.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s your &ldquo;why&rdquo; ?</p><p> Think of your &ldquo;why&rdquo; as the deeply rooted, unquenchable thirst you have for accomplishing something. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;creating shareholder value&rdquo; or &ldquo;make President&rsquo;s Club&rdquo; (does anyone still do that anymore ?).</p><p> Your &ldquo;why&rdquo; goes WAY deeper than that.</p><p> Your &ldquo;why&rdquo; relates directly to your values. To the things you hold dearly. To the things you can&rsquo;t live without. Your &ldquo;why&rdquo; is unique to you. And it&rsquo;s intrinsic (meaning it doesn&rsquo;t depend on external factors).</p><p> Unless you have a clear &ldquo;why&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll quit at the first sign of trouble.</p><p> You won&rsquo;t make that last call. Send that final email. Clean out your pipeline. Spend every waking hour thinking about how to do better.</p><p> Your why is highly personal, and emotional &ndash; maybe you want to give your family the lifestyle and security they deserve. Maybe you want to rise above your personal limitations. Maybe you want fame, admiration and recognition (don&rsquo;t laugh, some of us do).</p><p> Whatever it is, just find it, and be honest about it. With others, but mostly with yourself.</p><p> Unless you have a clear &ldquo;why&rdquo;, achieving the &ldquo;what&rdquo; becomes that much harder.</p><h3> <strong>  #4. You have ambiguous goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> I live by the beach. And I surf. Meaning that, when I leave my doorstep, I&rsquo;m surrounded by healthy, fit-looking youngsters who look like they&rsquo;ve been ripped out of the latest issue of GQ magazine.</p><p> So every spring, I go through the same struggle.</p><p> Part of me wants to look lean and fit (well, lean for a 40-something). But part of me also wants to enjoy life and have fun.</p><p> The problem is, these two things don&rsquo;t go together.</p><p> You can have the six pack, but you can&rsquo;t have a sixpack (think about it, you&rsquo;ll get my meaning).</p><p> Meaning I spend every spring in torment. At the end of a long day, part of me wants to take my kids out for pizza, and have a beer. But the other part wants me to go for a run instead.</p><p> Who wins ? It depends. But that&rsquo;s not the point.</p><p> The point is that, in this particular case, I have two desires which are diametrically opposed (&ldquo;being fit&rdquo; and &ldquo;enjoying life&rdquo;).</p><p> How many of us go through the same thing ? We dream of running our own business, but crave security and a dependable income. We want to be the top seller inside our firm, but we also want to spend more time at home. We want to exceed our targets, but hate the idea of prospecting.</p><p> Do yourself a favour. Stop it.</p><p> Just pick one side, and live with the idea that no &ndash; you can&rsquo;t have it all. If you truly, massively want to succeed, that takes sacrifice.</p><h3> <strong>  #5. You don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Look. I know we&rsquo;re supposed to set our goals in stone, and then work diligently to achieve them.</p><p> But in reality, life doesn&rsquo;t always work that way. It&rsquo;s not black or white. There&rsquo;s all kinds of shades of grey.</p><p> Maybe we lose a major deal, but we still did all we could to win it. We discover mid-year that the sixpack wasn&rsquo;t all that important anyway.</p><p> Or, as often happens, we almost hit our goal, but not quite.</p><p> I used to get frustrated when that happened. Not anymore.</p><p> For years, I&rsquo;ve set myself weight goals. Nothing too extreme, just enough for me to feel comfortable.

{"original_id":3885,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"My 2 Morning Tricks to Eating the Frog","link":"my-2-morning-tricks-to-eating-the-frog","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> If you haven&rsquo;t heard the expression &ldquo;eat the frog&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s shorthand for a Mark Twain quote. He said, &ldquo;Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> There are many variations to the back half of the quote, but the message is the same: If you&rsquo;re having trouble procrastinating, eat the frog to get it over with and get on with it.</p><p> This post is about my two morning tricks to eating the frog. But, my message is much grander than a digestive issue.</p><p> I want to give you a morning mindset to virtually guarantee success in your life. Bold, I know, but true nonetheless. I also want to stress it makes no difference what your morning routine is. It&rsquo;s how you think about your morning that matters.</p><p> First, I want to share a secret about myself that no one knows. When I say &ldquo;no one,&rdquo; I mean absolutely no one&mdash;not my wife (that&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve said that in print!), father, mother, team, or friends. Nada, zilch, no one.</p><h3> An African Parable</h3><p> <br/> Every single morning almost immediately as I awake, I think of this popular African parable. It started almost a dozen years ago when I first opened my recruitment firm  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  milewalk </a> .</p><p> Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up. It knows that it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning a lion wakes up. It knows that it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle: When the sun comes up you had better be running.</p><h3> Are You a Gazelle or a Lion?</h3><p> <br/> In the morning, I feel like a gazelle. When I go to sleep, I feel like a lion. What I do throughout the day transforms me.</p><p> What I think during the first few hours of the day gives me momentum to become the lion.</p><p> In the story, the gazelle rightly has fear&mdash;real fear. The gazelle&rsquo;s fear causes it to run. The non-life threatening fear most people feel in their lives, however, can be paralyzing. Fear is what prevents them from figuratively running.</p><p> Every morning when I wake up, I feel a pit in my stomach. Fear is the first thing I feel. My eyes pop open and I think I run a business that relies heavily on me and I need to constantly figure out ways to generate revenue to support for the staff, my wife, my dogs, and myself. That requires calling prospects, selling, marketing, handling candidates, and a bunch of other things I&rsquo;m sure I could do better. I need to write that next book, find the right publisher, so on and so forth.</p><p> The difference for me, however, is what my daily bout of morning fear causes me to do.</p><h3> Overcoming Fear&mdash;What to DO</h3><p> <br/> There is something vital to understand before you&rsquo;re able to overcome the feeling of fear. You must actfirst.</p><p> When you take action, you gain experience. When you gain experience, you gain competence. Competence makes fear less paralyzing.</p><p> You need to get into motion and act before you can do anything. And, you act your way into feeling. You don&rsquo;t feel your way into action!</p><p> Small steps are better than no steps. A small step with an emotional win is better than I giant step with a huge emotional loss.</p><p> Your actions can be anything. Get up. Walk to the bathroom. Take the dog out. Cook breakfast. Make Coffee. Drive to the gym. Exercise. Most people do these activities every morning, but the problem is they do them mindlessly.</p><h3> Overcoming Fear&mdash;What to THINK</h3><p> <br/> Winners think everything they do is a victory. I think every step I take in the morning is a victory. I literally register it my mind as a win.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter what your morning routine is. What matters is how you think about each step of your morning routine. It&rsquo;s your mindset that makes all the difference because your mindset breeds confidence. Your confidence is what makes you act. And, your confidence typically grows when it tallies more wins.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</h3><p> <br/> My alarm rings at 5:00 AM (on mornings I&rsquo;m not writing a book). My eyes open. I&rsquo;m breathing. I&rsquo;m alive. WIN.</p><p> Let the dogs out of their crate. Feed them. WIN. WIN.</p><p> Waltz to the balcony so the dogs can relieve themselves. WIN. (The inventor of the Porch Potty gets an annual holiday gift from us.)</p><p> Grab their relief with toilet paper. Make it all the way to the toilet bowl and deposit it without dropping anything. Ka. Boom. I&rsquo;m the best pooper-scooper ever. WIN.</p><p> Bathroom break abbreviated for, uh, blog post cleanliness. Brush teeth. Wham. I&rsquo;m the best teeth brusher ever!</p><p> Get dressed. I manage to get all my workout clothes on properly in their respective spots. WIN. I could actually make that something on the order of four or five wins if I count all body parts and feet separately.</p><p> Make coffee. Put it in the paper to-go cup. Didn&rsquo;t spill any. Wa-hoo!</p><p> Grab the car keys, phone, wallet, and gym bag and make it to the garage without falling. I&rsquo;m on a roll.</p><p> Workout at the gym. It&rsquo;s not even 7:00 AM yet. I can&rsquo;t believe how many victories I&rsquo;ve racked up.</p><p> By the time I&rsquo;m sitting at my desk, I&rsquo;ve already scored twenty or so victories. My mind thinks I&rsquo;m rolling right along.</p><p> Now I can eat the frog. It shouldn&rsquo;t be too tough because it practically feels like dinnertime.</p><p> I always love to hear from you: What are your morning secrets to success?</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-11 20:23:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-11 20:23:30.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_94ayi7z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/my-2-morning-tricks-to-eating-the-frog/\", \"post_id\": \"8533\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-11 20:23:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-11 20:23:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"my-2-morning-tricks-to-eating-the-frog\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8532\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4029\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-2-Morning-Tricks-to-Eating-the-Frog.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"983\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452605400,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3886,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Advisor As Talent Scout","link":"the-advisor-as-talent-scout","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As professional advisors, we know that there are professionals and then there are best-in-class professionals. Our clients suspect as much when they answer a simple question, &ldquo;If you wanted to reduce your tax bill and could afford any CPA, which would you choose: your CPA or Warren Buffett&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> This appreciation for quality holds true when owners decide to sell their companies. This once-in-a-lifetime transaction is the most important financial decision your client will ever make. If that&rsquo;s not reason enough to find the best advisors for your client, let me share a few more.</p><li> <strong>  Buyers have top-shelf accounting, legal, deal and tax advisors. </strong> These advisors likely do dozens of deals a year. Your clients need the best possible advisors simply to level the playing field. Relying on their existing advisors to play on their Deal Team may put them at the same disadvantage the local high school basketball team would face playing the NBA All Stars.</li><li> <strong>  Using experienced advisors saves time and money. </strong> Warren Buffet knows this. So do private equity firms and strategic buyers. That&rsquo;s why they use them. <br/>  </li><h3> Recommendations <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  If an owner&rsquo;s current CPA and attorney have acted as lead advisors on dozens of transactions of similar size and complexity to your client&rsquo;s, their experience may compare favorably with the buyer&rsquo;s lead counsel. </strong> Experience plays a huge role in the design, negotiation, and orchestration of a deal. Without experience, your client and his or her advisors may be outmanned and outmaneuvered and not even know it. It&rsquo;s worth educating owners as they embark on the most important financial transaction of their business lives about why they should use the best advisors available. That&rsquo;s what buyers do. Part of your role can be to assist your clients in interviewing and selecting their Deal Team.</li><li> <strong>  Find and recruit your client&rsquo;s Deal Team well in advance of deciding to go to market. </strong> Easy to say, but how do you find great players? Ask existing advisors and M&amp;A advisors in your community. If you know a BEI-trained Exit Planning advisor, ask them to refer players. These advisors have interviewed local M&amp;A advisors and can provide you with names and recommendations. <br/>  </li><h3> Two M&amp;A experts offer this advice: <br/>  </h3><p> BEI Member and transaction intermediary Mark Smith says, &ldquo;I suggest to owners that they ask potential advisors if they belong to professional associations directly related to the task/role that the owner is considering them for. This question is a great way to discover if a prospective advisor invests in continuing education or has done the training necessary to earn certification from professional associations (like BEI or the International Business Brokers Association).&rdquo;</p><p> From BEI Member and investment banker Kevin Short: &ldquo;I suggest that owners choosing an investment banker: 1) interview that person in his or her office to get a feel for its professional atmosphere and activity level; 2) carefully check references of both the banker and his or her firm with other advisors (especially attorneys) in the community in which the banker is active; 3) ask the banker how many deals he or she has closed in the last three years; and 4) talk to several of the banker&rsquo;s former clients. Unfortunately, investment bankers are like surgeons in that you can only gauge their expertise after the fact.&rdquo;</p><h3> Hiring your client&rsquo;s Deal Team in advance of going to market has a number of additional advantages. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  The transaction intermediary (business broker or investment banker) estimates your client&rsquo;s company&rsquo;s likely sale price. </strong> Use this to determine the size of any gap between the resources your owner/client needs to achieve financial security and his or her existing financial resources. This information is essential to eliminate other Deal Killers described in preceding articles.</li><li> <strong>  You will understand (and incorporate in your Gap Analysis) the fees deal professionals charge. </strong> This information also helps to determine the client&rsquo;s net proceeds upon a sale.</li><li> <strong>  The Deal Team can provide at least an educated guess </strong> regarding the amount and form of the purchase price that will likely not be paid at closing, i.e. a promissory note carried by the owner or an earn-out.</li><li> <strong>  From experience, the Deal Team can point out areas within your client&rsquo;s company that are likely to concern potential buyers </strong> , giving you and existing advisors time to correct deficiencies. <br/>  </li><p> You do not need to be part of your client&rsquo;s Deal Team to provide the vital service of ensuring that owners achieve the best-possible result when they sell to an outside party. As we often like to subtly suggest: If you don&rsquo;t do this for your client, who will?</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-11 20:45:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-11 20:45:18.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Olz428B.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-advisor-as-talent-scout/\", \"post_id\": \"8535\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-11 20:45:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-11 20:45:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-advisor-as-talent-scout\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8534\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4030\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Advisor-As-Talent-Scout_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"695\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452600900,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Because he is great at selling and he focuses his efforts on women.</p><p> He recognized early that as women become more financially empowered and as male boomers begin to die and the family wealth is transferred to their wives, his best opportunity to grow his business rests with women. But he also realized that prospecting, and especially selling to women, required a different set of skills than he had. So he took the time to learn about marketing to women and upgraded his selling skills. Now, a few years later, this prep work has served him well.</p><h3> Just being a good financial advisor isn&rsquo;t enough anymore &ndash; arguably having good sales and people skills is just as important and his case is a perfect example.</h3><p> <br/> Like most of us, financial advisors work hard at their business. Understandably, they want to do well but doing well traditionally meant excelling at delivering good rates of return for their clients. So many advisors still focus on becoming licensed as portfolio managers and earning educational credits to become experts in asset allocation, portfolio optimization and risk management. All the while, they put little thought into developing skills related to building strong relationships with people, which is the cornerstone of any successful practice.</p><p> To be fair, yours is a profession where interpersonal skills have taken a back seat to investment management. But today, prospecting and selling is all about having good interpersonal skills -- and by prospecting, we don&rsquo;t just mean hobnobbing on the golf course with buddies.</p><p> The thinking has always been that if you are good at what you do, clients will come to you, referrals will flow and business will be great. And, while that may have been true in the past, it is no longer the case. Today, you have to be pro-active in meeting and connecting with people on a personal level, especially if you want to connect with women.</p><p> Unfortunately, we encounter far too many financial advisors whose practice is floundering and they don&rsquo;t even know why. They truly believe that working hard at delivering results is all they need to do.  They seem surprised when we tell them that just like they had to learn to manage money, they have to learn good selling skills, which includes listening to and understanding people as well as reaching out to them effectively.</p><p> To some of you it may seem like too much effort. But consider this: competition is fierce, Fintechs are all the rage and Robo-advisors are coming on strong aimed squarely at the next generation of investors, millennials &ndash; you can&rsquo;t continue to do things the old way with a market that expects a different experience from an advisor.</p><p> But fear not, it isn&rsquo;t all gloom and doom. For those willing to take the time to learn how to present themselves as a person, rather than an investment machine, and are willing to spend the money to reach out to women in their environment, there are tremendous opportunities, not only for today but well into the future.</p><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> Understand that women represent a huge growth opportunity but being a good, even excellent, financial advisor is not enough.

Over time, search algorithm engineers found that simply identifying a direct match to a person&rsquo;s search query didn&rsquo;t necessarily equate with value for readers &mdash; especially when marketers were gaming the system with poorly-written copy like this example here:</p><p> <img alt=\"Keyword stuffing example\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Keyword_stuffing_example_2.jpg\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.inklyo.com/blog/seo-mistakes-to-avoid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Inklyo.com  </a> </u> <a href=\"https://www.inklyo.com/blog/seo-mistakes-to-avoid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a></p><p> Aside from reusing the same keyword phrase over and over on a site, marketers have also tried bullet lists of keywords or phone numbers that lack context and blocks of text listing cities they&rsquo;re trying to rank for in local search &mdash; black hat tactics which are all expressly forbidden by  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66358?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   Google webmasters  </a> </u> . Hiring a decent writer is a good first step to avoiding this sort of nonsense in the future. Not sure where to find reliable, experienced writers these days?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/content-marketing-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ask us!  </a> </u></p><h3> 2. No Keyword Research</h3><p> <br/> Some marketers have gone the opposite way on the spectrum and decided that ALL keywords are a bad idea. Instead of conducting smarter keyword research and writing, they instruct their teams to &ldquo;just write naturally&rdquo; without any keyword direction whatsoever. SEO experts understand there is still a place for well-researched long-tail keywords.</p><p> As long as they read coherently, these more descriptive phrases (rather than generic terms) zero-in on audiences who are not only likely to visit &mdash; but more likely to convert as well. For instance,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wordtracker.com/academy/keyword-research/technical-guides/three-good-reasons-to-target-long-tail-keywords\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   as Wordtracker points out  </a> </u> , someone just looking for general information might type in &ldquo;California mountain,&rdquo; whereas a person who is more ready to make a specific purchase might type in something like &ldquo;California mountain climbing tours&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mt Shasta family climbing tours.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. Weak Or Duplicate Content</h3><p> <br/> At one time, 300 words was sufficient for a blog post. These days, we&rsquo;ve seen top-performing brands adopt long-form content strategies to boost SEO ranking and value for their audiences. By contrast, search engines largely view websites without much content as &ldquo;low-quality,&rdquo; which leads to poor ranking. Your page should contain at least some content that tops 1,500 words, along with proper text formatting, optimized images and video embeds.</p><p> Removing duplicate content is one of the quickest paths to resurrecting a website from virtual obscurity. Not only is copying someone else&rsquo;s content damaging for your SEO, but it&rsquo;s also unethical and illegal! Even if you have taken the steps to secure republishing rights, duplicate content is still a risky tactic that offers little pay-off.</p><p> If you publish guest posts on other sites, it&rsquo;s okay to largely use the same content, but make sure you tweak some of the phrasing to create &ldquo;an evil twin,&rdquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/myths-about-duplicate-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   as Kissmetrics puts it  </a> </u> . Also, review  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   Google&rsquo;s rules and recommendations  </a> </u>  regarding duplicate content to be sure you&rsquo;re on the same page.</p><p> It&rsquo;s legit to use a block of text from another site, as long as you attribute and link to it (as we so often do here!) That sort of external research increases the value of your commentary, without hurting your reputation or SEO in any way.</p><p> Lastly, check out WordTracker&rsquo;s post on various duplicate content issues (from session IDs, paginated pages and different domains, to title tags, canonicalization and faulty redirects), as well as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.audiencebloom.com/2011/03/duplicate-content-all-evidence-considered-all-questions-answered/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this extensive post at Audience Bloom  </a> </u> , which covers any question about duplicate content you could possibly have.</p><h3> 4. Spammy Backlinks</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve worked with a number of companies slammed by the Google Penguin update. If you&rsquo;ve received a penalty or unnatural links notification or your site&rsquo;s performance declined significantly all of a sudden, then it&rsquo;s probably time for a massive backlink cleanup.  <u>  <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/consider-backlink-cleanup-184246\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Search Engine Land  </a> </u>  compared backlink cleanup as akin to &ldquo;cleaning your house after a flood.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s no easy task. You&rsquo;ll need an SEO firm&rsquo;s help for sure. On the other hand, gradual backlink maintenance is more like &ldquo;sweeping your floors,&rdquo; they say, and is totally doable.  <u>  Link Removal Guide </u>  offers a quick checklist to help you get started cleaning up your link profile, which will show you tangible SEO results in no time.</p><h3> 5. No Link Building</h3><p> <br/> Link farms gave the practice of linking a bad name. Yet, as with any abuse of the system, there is still a &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to approach this SEO-related activity. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sitepronews.com/2014/11/12/the-most-epic-seo-blunders-of-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Site Pro News  </a> </u>  clarifies, &ldquo;Receiving quality inbound links from relevant sites is still important to Google; it helps to validate your credibility. Outbound links are just as critical, especially to authority domains.&rdquo; Spend some time doing your homework and only link to relevant websites within your industry.</p><h3> 6. No Content Strategy</h3><p> <br/> SEO and content are not separate strategies. They&rsquo;re inextricably intertwined. Active blogs help your website rank for optimal keywords, get indexed, maintain visibility in search, stay relevant in social media, generate inbound links, boost click-throughs and improve conversions. All of these signals point to your brand as a valuable contributor to the web. In addition to maintaining consistent blog presence, you also want to make sure your internal web pages and meta data remain fresh and original.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not enough to have a general game plan in your head. Even though nearly half of all B2B content marketers lack a written strategy,  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/09/b2b-content-marketing-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Content Marketing Institute  </a> </u>  found that &ldquo;The most-effective marketers are more likely than less-effective marketers to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-b2b-content-marketing-failing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   document their content marketing strategy  </a> </u> , have a documented editorial mission statement, and hold regular meetings. In fact, 61% of the most-effective B2B marketers meet daily or weekly with their content marketing team either virtually or in person.&rdquo;</p><h3> 7. Incomplete On-Page SEO</h3><p> <br/> One of the last steps in SEO is fine-tuning the on-page elements. On-page SEO covers topics like: using the right keywords (but sparingly), creating fresh, quality content, and maintaining consistency among brand messages. It also covers more technical aspects like filling out all title, description and image tags in their entirety.</p><p> Also, we love this helpful infographic from QuickSEOResults:</p><p> <img alt=\"on page seo\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/on-page-seo.jpg\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  PageTrafficBuzz.com </u></p><h3> 8. Not Utilizing Analytics &amp; Google Webmaster Tools</h3><p> <br/> Google&rsquo;s Matt Cutts told Search Engine Land one of the biggest SEO mistakes people can make is &ldquo;Not using webmaster resources and learning about how Google works and what SEO is about.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re not measuring your website&rsquo;s data, then the best you can hope for is a stroke of good fortune from a blind stab in the dark. Instead, you want to see which efforts are most fruitful and which website elements need improved optimization. You&rsquo;ll need conversion goals, weekly reports and keyword monitoring established in regular practice.</p><h3> Quality SEO Services That Deliver Results</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t let prospects pass your website by.

Use This Checklist To Prepare","link":"women-planning-to-divorce-in-2016-use-this-checklist-to-prepare","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Janet and Bill had some happy years together &ndash; until she learned of his infidelities. Since then, she&rsquo;s been trying to make the best of it, for the children&rsquo;s sake.</h3><p> <br/> Now, though, Janet realizes she can&rsquo;t continue hoping things will work out. It&rsquo;s time to end the marriage and move on with her life, and she&rsquo;s going to do just that &ndash; now that the holidays have come and gone. Breaking the news to family over gatherings for Thanksgiving, Chanukah and Christmas felt wrong, and by contrast, January seems to be a perfect fit &ndash; New Year, new life.</p><p> Janet&rsquo;s situation is quite common. Many women wait until after the holidays to move forward with their divorces, and it can make excellent sense to do so.</p><p> Now that January is here, though, it&rsquo;s time to get started. More specifically, here are five things for you to do this month:</p><h3> Research divorce professionals in your area. </h3><p> To ensure the best possible outcome for your divorce, take the time to build a  <u>  <a href=\"http://bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=275\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   qualified divorce team  </a> </u> . I recommend you start with these three players: a matrimonial/family law attorney, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://bedrockdivorce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   divorce financial planner  </a> </u>  and a therapist/counselor. Spend some time researching divorce professionals and create a short list of candidates for each position. Then schedule interviews with the finalists &ndash; the sooner, the better.</p><h3> Start collecting financial documents. </h3><p> Using my  <u>  <a href=\"http://bedrockdivorce.com/Financial-information-checklist.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Divorce Financial Checklist  </a> </u>  as a reference, assemble copies of all relevant financial documents concerning your bank and brokerage accounts, credit cards, mortgages, insurance policies, etc. Watch the mail for year-end statements, and copy those. Keep your copies in a safe deposit box that your husband can&rsquo;t access.</p><h3> Check your credit report. </h3><p> While you&rsquo;re gathering financial records, keep a careful eye on your credit card statements. Request a copy of your credit report. With that in hand, monitor your score carefully so you&rsquo;ll be the first to know if any unusual activity occurs.  (For example, did your husband use your joint credit cards to buy his girlfriend gifts this holiday season?)  Check out my article,  <u>  <a href=\"http://bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=85\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How To Protect Your Credit Score During Your Divorce  </a> </u> , for more tips and information about credit.</p><h3> Open new accounts in your name alone. </h3><p> Moving forward as a single woman in 2016 will require that you have a bank account and credit cards in your own name. It&rsquo;s a good idea to lay that groundwork now. Go to a different bank than where you currently have joint accounts, and open both savings and checking accounts in your name.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll need your own credit card, too, and you should start that process now, as well. It can take time for women with little or no income to establish credit on their own. Plan accordingly, and know that obtaining credit is going to be more complicated than just filling out an application or making a single phone call.</p><h3> Remain vigilant. </h3><p> Is your husband using the good cheer of the holidays as cover while he dissipates family assets? Be attentive, and if you are concerned at all about financial shenanigans by your husband, you may want to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?p=168\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   think twice about filing a joint return with him for 2015  </a> </u> .</p><p> Finally, if you know you&rsquo;ll be divorcing, take time to consciously shift your focus away from the failings of the marriage and toward protecting your financial future as a single woman. When your divorce proceedings get underway in the New Year, it will be very important to  <u>  <a href=\"http://thinkfinancially.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Think Financially, Not Emotionally&reg;  </a> </u>  for the best possible outcome.</p><p> ###</p><p> <strong>  Reminder: </strong>  It can be a good idea to wait till the New Year to announce your intention to divorce, but it would be a bad idea not to be ready for the process to begin when you do announce it. Taking the five pro-active steps I outlined above puts you in a strong positon.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip:  </strong> Do NOT feel guilty if you feel it&rsquo;s best to make quiet preparations for divorce. It comes as a surprise to many divorcing women that their husbands have been doing exactly that, perhaps even hiding assets (for months or even years!) to avoid having to divide them with their wives. You&rsquo;ll be very grateful later that you laid this important groundwork early on.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters: </strong>  State laws governing the divorce process vary widely and in many respects. If you have homes in multiple states, you may have a choice of jurisdiction in which to file. As you are researching divorce attorneys, it is worth your time to find out if filing in one state or another is likely to be more favorable to your case. Consider, too, any complications your case is likely to present, and seek out special expertise in those issues. I recommend working with professionals whose practices have specific experience successfully helping divorcing women.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-11 22:28:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-11 22:28:55.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_PyREanj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-planning-to-divorce-in-2016-use-this-checklist-to-prepare/\", \"post_id\": \"8540\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-11 22:28:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-11 22:28:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-planning-to-divorce-in-2016-use-this-checklist-to-prepare\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8539\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4033\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Top-8-SEO-Mistakes-To-Avoid-in-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1415\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452630600,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}

He took to the press (the Dutch newspaper Parool was the first to publish) and disclosed his ideas on the arms race. For that, he was banned from applied research, targeted by the media as a traitor, and banned to Nizhny Novgorod. It took over ten years and a new head of state before he could return to Moscow.</p><h3> \"For me, the moral difficulties lie in the continual pressure brought to bear on my friends and immediate family, pressure which is not directed against me personally but which at the same time is all around me\"</h3><p> <br/> Being a dissident is extremely hard, for our survival depends on the group we belong to. Our parents and caregivers, our employers and colleagues, our families and friends; we rely on their actions to inform us what&rsquo;s right and how to behave when we&rsquo;re not sure what to do. We want to be liked and to belong. Why bite the hand that feeds us?</p><p> Many scientific experiments were done to find out why we conform and how far we&rsquo;ll take conformity. Two of them made the top ten of most famous experiments in history. The first is the experiment by Solomon Asch in 1955 and the other by Philip Zimbardo in 1971.</p><h3> Asch Conformity Experiments <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FnT2FcuZaYI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-11-at-2.53.25-PM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a> <br/> click to view</p><p> Groups of eight subjects were shown two cards.

They would always unanimously nominate one comparator, but on certain trials, they would give the correct response and on others, an incorrect response. The real participant was always asked last.</p><p> Only 25% of the sample consistently defied the majority opinion and 5% was always persuaded by the group. Would you yield if you knew you were right?</p><h3> The Psychology of Evil <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OsFEV35tWsg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-11-at-2.56.33-PM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a> <br/> click to view</p><p> Twenty-four stable and healthy college students were asked to play the role of either prisoner or guard in a two-week prison simulation. The experiment was abruptly stopped after only six days, as psychological torture occurred. Many of the prisoners passively accepted that and those who resisted were harassed by other prisoners at the request of the guards. Only two of the prisoners quit the experiment early and five of them had to be removed.</p><p> It seemed that the situation rather than personality caused the participants&rsquo; behavior. The harsh conditions and the overt power difference between the two groups supposedly played a big role. But other factors could have influenced the gruesome outcome. Participants are likely to do what they believe the researchers want them to do: a willingness to conform so high, that little was needed to engage in cruel behavior.</p><p> Both studies make a very clear point about social pressure. In business contexts, we often discuss this phenomenon under the title groupthink. The term was coined by social psychologist Irving Janis (1972). It occurs when a group makes faulty decisions because group pressures lead to a deterioration of &ldquo;mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment&rdquo;.</p><p> Groupthink can be detrimental to the bottom line:</p><h3> Strong Leaders Look for Dissenting Opinions and Difficult Questions</h3><p> <br/> Too often, leaders are the last to hear bad news or unintentionally label dissent as negativity and criticism. But looking for and accepting dissent is a crucial factor that differentiates business failures and successes.</p><h3> The New Coke Disaster</h3><p> <br/> Consider Coca-Cola. In April 1985, Coca-Cola released New Coke, a reformulated version of cola because they had lost market share to Pepsi. Consumers became enraged. They started to hamster the old cola, flooded the customer service department with complaints, filed lawsuits. Coca-Cola was forced to reintroduce &ldquo;Coca-Cola Classic&rdquo; three months later. Can you imagine how this would have ended in our age of social media&hellip;</p><h3> What happened?</h3><p> <br/> In 1980, Robert Goizueta took over as CEO and announced that there would be no sacred cows in how the company was run and formulated its drinks. In 1983, Coca-Cola&rsquo;s market share had shrunk from 60% to 24%. Pepsi, the sweeter cola, had gained considerably. Was it about taste? Market analysts believed baby boomers were more likely to purchase diet drinks as they aged. Future growth in the full-calorie segment had to come from younger drinkers, who at that time favored Pepsi.</p><p> Market analysts believed baby boomers were more likely to purchase diet drinks as they aged. Future growth in the full-calorie segment had to come from younger drinkers, who at that time favored Pepsi.</p><p> A secret task force called: &ldquo;Project Kansas&rdquo; went on to develop a new flavor. In their blind taste tests, New Coke beat both Coke and Pepsi. But when the tasters were asked if they would buy and drink it if it really were Coca-Cola, a small minority of 10-12% felt angry and would stop drinking Coke if that was to happen. But as a later surveys were less negative, the criticism was downplayed.</p><p> The management then considered and rejected the idea to use the flavor as a new variety. Bottlers were protesting other product differentiations already. Some were suing Coke over syrup policies. And a new variety would cannibalize the already shrinking market share.</p><p> Goizueta framed the discussion as New Coke or No Coke and said he had the blessing of his predecessor.</p><p> In the meantime, Pepsi had smuggled in a preview six-pack and considered the new flavor a serious threat. They wasted no time and counter-attacked: the CEO declared a company-wide holiday and advertised with full-page ads declaring Pepsi the winner of the cola wars.</p><p> In April, New Coke came on the market. Some Coke executives started to argue the reintroduction of the old formula in May. By June, the new formula was already leveling. End of June, southern bottlers took customer complaints to the Coke executives in a private meeting. The company then faced a boycott by customers and bottlers alike. Finally, in July, the board capitulated and brought back the original formula.</p><h3> How to Seek Out Dissent?</h3><p> <br/> The New Coke example tells us how disastrous groupthink can work out in business decisions. As a futurist, I am often included in strategic discussions, and it&rsquo;s up to me as a moderator to elicit dissent in a positive way. Here is how I work:</p><h3> Start</h3><p> <br/> Ask for several opinions: &ldquo;What are the various possibilities that you all see?&rdquo; When the first opinion is given, force the opinion owner to decide firmly and boldly: &ldquo;What would YOU do?&rdquo;. Avoid a decision by the group, leave the responsibility for the decision with the contributor.

{"original_id":3891,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What is the Character of Your Organization?","link":"what-is-the-character-of-your-organization","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones.&rdquo; &mdash;Phillips Brooks <br/>  </h3><p> Change is consistent and the ability of your organization to remain successful is dependent on the strength of its character. While the way you lead must continually evolve, this evolution must be built on the solid foundation of strong organizational character. This character determines your focus, keeps both leaders and employees grounded, and provides the loyalty and perseverance necessary for continued success. How can you determine what the character of your organization is? Start by asking yourself these four questions.</p><h3> Can you see the big picture? <br/>  </h3><p> Metrics will never tell the whole story. Can you see the big picture; the picture that extends beyond just the numbers on a screen? Are you putting short-term results ahead of good, solid business practices? Focusing on the short-term can actually be a disadvantage in the long run. Are you able to evaluate the consequences of your decisions on the organization as a whole? Do you fully understand both the short and long term effects of your actions? Can you see how your words and actions, as a leader, impact the character of your organization?</p><h3> Do you have the right people in the right positions? <br/>  </h3><p> Employees do a good job when they are doing it because they want to. No amount of micromanagement can replace a structure where people are put in positions that allow them to use their talents. Are your employees serving in roles where they can inspire and influence others? Are they trusted to act and make decisions without being micromanaged? Are they allowed to use their skills and experience to design how their own tasks get accomplished? Are they encouraged to use their talents to mentor others? The character of your organization can be quickly undermined by the wrong employees in the wrong positions? Are your employees being utilized in the right places?</p><h3> Do people know what to expect? <br/>  </h3><p> One of the greatest gauges of the character of your organization is consistency. Do employees know what to expect from you as a leader? Do customers know what to expect from your employees and your products or services? Do employees know what to expect from colleagues? When everyone involved in the organization feels engaged with the core purpose and values of the company they will act in a way that is consistent with these values. What people expect from each other and your organization speaks loudly as to the character of your organization.</p><h3> Are you asking the right questions? <br/>  </h3><p> No one person knows all the answers. Are you asking the right questions? Are you asking a diverse group of people? Are you questioning your assumptions about what is possible? Are you asking for and then responding appropriately and quickly to feedback? When you start asking the right questions, you start to get a realistic picture of where you are, where you are heading, and where it is possible for you to go. Asking the right questions leads to the diverse, creative thinking that helps develop the character of your organization.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s Time to Act</h3><p> <br/> Will the character of your organization remain consistent when you encounter hardships? Is it strong enough to weather continual change? The character of your organization needs to be solid, to be strong, and to be consistent.</p><p> It&rsquo;s time to act; time to start asking the questions and getting a realistic picture of the character of your organization. Can you see the big picture? Do you have the right people in the right positions? Do people know what to expect? Are you asking the right questions?</p><p> Make sure the character of your organization sends the right message to everyone involved both internally and externally. Attention to character helps to build a strong foundation for your organization that will withstand the challenges and twist and turns you will encounter in the future.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 20:39:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 20:39:07.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_GlbAYgq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-is-the-character-of-your-organization/\", \"post_id\": \"8545\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 20:39:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 20:39:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-is-the-character-of-your-organization\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8541\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4036\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Leadership-and-the-Unpopular-Choice_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"423\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452716100,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3892,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 10 Worst Money Moves for 2016","link":"the-10-worst-money-moves-for-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Complacency can derail even the best of intentions. For a 2016 that moves you closer to your retirement goals, you'll want to be on high alert for any of these ten complacency-ridden worst money moves.</p><p> <strong>  1. Don't increase your savings </strong></p><p> Save more? No. You want to spend all of that raise.</p>Has saving more ever hurt anyone? No, I didn't think so. It won't hurt you either. Viewing a raise or unexpected bonus as \"extra\" is not a bad idea &mdash; but saving some of it for a rainy day is an even better idea. For every raise or bonus you get, bank some of it. This habit will put you in solid financial shape within a few short years.<p> The worst thing you can do? Get complacent and spend more each year as your income goes up.</p><p> <strong>  2. Disregard risk </strong></p><p> Risk? It's all about where to get the best return on investment. Risk isn't a factor.</p><p> Pay down the mortgage? Take Social Security early? Too many people evaluate these decisions based on where they think they can get the highest return. There's a giant problem with this &mdash; return is not a certain thing.</p><p> Having no mortgage in retirement can reduce  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/investmentincome/a/Sequence-Of-Returns-Risk-Misunderstood-By-Many-Retirees.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sequence risk  </a> </u>  (the risk of drawing money out in retirement in a declining market) and delaying the start of your Social Security can protect you against a retiree's number one stated risk &mdash; the risk of running out of money in old age.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Continue making decisions without considering the full spectrum of risks you'll face in retirement and how your decisions may reduce &mdash; or increase &mdash; your exposure to those risks.</p><p> <strong>  3. Ignore your career asset </strong></p><p> Your career is good enough. You don't have time to invest in yourself.</p><p> A colleague of mine, Michael Haubrich, wrote a book called Career Asset Management that I wish I'd had when I graduated college. It teaches you how to get the greatest value from your largest asset &mdash; your human capital. It's never too late to start looking at your knowledge and experience as an asset. Continue to invest in that asset and it will likely be the best investment you'll ever make. Could you get a new certification, expand your leadership skills through specialized classes, or get another degree?</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Assume you are employable just the way you are and make no self-improvement efforts.</p><p> <strong>  4. Wait until the last minute </strong></p><p> A retirement income plan? Who needs that? Retirement is still years away.</p><p> Two of my favorite quotes from my favorite retirement income conference in 2015 were, \"Retirement is an unforgiving endeavor\" and \"When you have safety nets, you worry less.\"</p><p> Who wouldn't want less worry? Worry reduction starts with planning and research has shown those who start planning at least five years before retirement have the highest levels of satisfaction in retirement. A solid plan also puts you in a strong situation should an unforeseen early retirement be forced upon you &mdash; and this is a common occurrence for many in their late 50s and early 60s.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Wait until retirement shows up, often by surprise, and scramble to put a plan in place.</p><p> <strong>  5. Don't solve for after-tax results </strong></p><p> All dollars are equal, right? So make comparisons based on gross results &mdash; don't go to all the work of looking at things in after-tax dollars.</p><p> All dollars are most definitely not equal, and that is more apparent in retirement than at any other time in your life. Apply a simple rule like the 4% rule and you think you'll have $4,000 per $100,000 of capital to spend. But suppose one retiree has all capital in retirement accounts along with a pension, while the other has all capital in a brokerage account along with Social Security.</p><p> When viewed on an after-tax basis, the first retiree may only have $2,500 of that $4,000 available to spend, while the second may have all $4,000 available.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Ignore taxes and the impact they will have on your retirement income.</p><p> <strong>  6. Apply one-size-fits-all advice </strong></p><p> Single, married, over 66, under 55, male, female, what difference does it make? Good advice is good for everyone, isn't it?</p><p> Financial advice is not a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-one-size-fits-all-investing-never-works-2015-04-17\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one-size fits-all proposition  </a> </u> . Singles face different risks than married couples. Women face different risks than men. Those who will reach 66 earlier in the 2016 year will have  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/socialsecuritybenefits/fl/New-Social-Security-Rules-that-Affect-Couples-and-Ex-Spouses.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   different Social Security choices  </a> </u>  to make than those who are younger. Those still saving should invest differently than those who are near retirement.</p><p> Sure, some advice is universal, such as saving more, which is pretty much good for anyone, but numerous other decision points, such as investing, when to take Social Security, and which risks are most likely to affect you, vary by demographics.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Follow generic advice without considering your own demographics and life stage and how the advice should change based on those things.</p><p> <strong>  7. Don't push the limits </strong></p><p> Contribution limits to 401(k)s and IRAs in 2016 remain the same as 2015, so you don't need to do anything differently, do you?</p><p> It's true the 2016 maximum contribution limits to most retirement plans remain the same as they were in 2015. But some lesser known limits have changed. For example, the maximum amount of income you can have and still contribute to a Roth IRA increased slightly.</p><p> Whatever the limits may be, are you pushing them? What's the worst thing that could happen by max funding a Roth IRA, or increasing your emergency fund to seven months of living expenses instead of six? Heck, if you get to the end of the year and don't like having more money saved, you can change your mind and spend it.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Never revise your savings habits based on changing limits. Just assume what worked last year will work the same way this year.</p><p> <strong>  8. Measure nothing </strong></p><p> It's too much work to track monthly spending, or update your net worth statement. What good would it do anyway?</p><p> A few people can diet without a scale, but most need a measuring process to see how they are progressing. Finances are no different.</p><p> Simple systems are best. For example, try tracking total dollars out of the bank account each month by recording the numbers from your bank statement in a spreadsheet. Or track total monthly or annual contributions to all savings and retirement accounts.</p><p> You'll be amazed at how a simple monitoring system raises your level of awareness and has an automatic effect on your spending and savings behavior.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Measure no personal financial statistics and hope for the best.</p><p> <strong>  9. Trade often and impulsively </strong></p><p> You have to watch your money every day, and if the market is going down, you have to do something right?</p><p> Research shows  <u>  <a href=\"http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/BoysWillBeBoys.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   frequent trading is often linked to overconfidence  </a> </u>  and delivers inferior results when compared to those one might get by using a calmer approach focused on long-term outcomes. Despite such research, impulsive investing behavior continues and retirement nest eggs are not as large as they could be because of it.</p><p> For the new year, put together a 10-year plan and give up the trading. Focus on diversification and think about results over decades, not days. The 70- or 80-year-old you will thank you.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Get caught up in trends and media frenzies and trade each time scary news comes out.</p><p> <strong>  10. Base trust on personality </strong></p><p> He or she is so friendly, nice and part of a social group you know. Of course you trust them.</p><p> There are specific tactics that con artists use to pull off scams. Social proof is one of them &mdash; if other people like and accept someone and are investing with them it must be ok, right?</p><p> According to the Center for Retirement Research Squared Away blog post,  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/the-psychology-of-fraud/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Psychology of Fraud  </a> </u> , experts predict that the incidence of fraud against the elderly will continue to increase in coming years. As you age, you naturally  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/postretirementplanning/fl/How-to-Protect-Your-Money-From-Poor-Decisions-Due-to-Cognitive-Decline.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   experience cognitive decline  </a> </u>  and your ability to weed out the \"too good to be true\" offers won't be as good as it used to be. Best to pick advisors you trust based on experience and credentials &mdash; and do it early on in retirement, not later.</p><p> The worst thing you can do? Be too trusting later in life and risk your life savings on someone's idea because they seem so nice.</p><p> Recognize yourself in any of these 10 behaviors? If so, get your 2016 off to a good start and decide what are you going to do about it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 21:05:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 21:05:30.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ezYRW7x.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-10-worst-money-moves-for-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8547\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 21:05:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 21:05:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-10-worst-money-moves-for-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8546\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4037\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10-Worst-Money-Moves-for-2016-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"838\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452681000,"author_id":125,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3893,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"To Mark the Spot with Benchmarking or Not?","link":"to-mark-the-spot-with-benchmarking-or-not","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Are you focusing on a benchmark that may not or may no longer be a valid mark to strive for?  </strong> <br/> <br/> I recently came across the following Chinese parable, and as I often do, wondered how this story might apply to customer experience measurement and management initiatives. <br/> <br/> The parable, titled \"Mark the Boat for a Dropped Sword\" goes like this:</p>There was a man crossing a river on a boat. When the boat reached the middle of the river, he accidentally dropped his sword into the water. He scrambled to grab it, but it was too late: the sword had already sunk to the bottom of the river. He immediately pulled out a small dagger and proceeded to carve a small mark into the side of the boat. He then said aloud, &ldquo;This is where my sword dropped in the water.&rdquo; When the boat reached the bank on the other side of the river, the man jumped into the water to look for his sword in the place where he had marked the boat. <br/><br/>Of course, the boat had since moved, but the sword itself had not. Isn&rsquo;t this a foolish way to look for his sword?<br/> <p> First, let me just say that I hope we're all smarter than that! But let's go with the moral of the story and work from there: everything in the world constantly changes.   <br/> <br/> So how do we tie this story to customer experience? I make the connection vis-&agrave;-vis benchmarking your voice of the customer metrics, e.g., NPS, customer effort score, satisfaction, and loyalty. Benchmarking means that you're making comparisons to competitors or to some standard or average in order to help you understand the relative perception of your business in the minds of your customers. <br/> <br/> When you benchmark, you've put a stake in the ground (or a mark on the boat) and have decided that that's where you want to be as an organization. The problem is, just like the boat, the benchmark moves while the sword (your company) remains exactly where it is relative to the benchmark. Why? For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is a misplaced focus on the numbers rather than on the customer experience. <br/> <br/> Tom Peters takes an interesting stance on benchmarking - and addresses that movement - in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AGTpu_i8sc&amp;feature=player_embedded\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   talk  </a> </u>  he gave back in 2007:</p>I hate benchmarking. Benchmarking is stupid. Why is it stupid? Because we pick the current industry leader, and then we launch a five-year program, the goal of which is to be as good as whoever was best five years ago five years from now. Which to me is not exactly an Olympian aspiration.<br/> <p> Benchmarking is fine to do in order to get that relative perspective - and that's all it is; you really need to take that information for what it is and figure out what makes your company unique. How can you be different?  How can your company become the one that inspires others? What about your business approach excites customers to consider your products and services first?  <br/> <br/> Typically when companies are focused on benchmarks, they don't have a real strategy in place; they've got an executive looking at their NPS, for example, and wondering where they stand; it's probably a metric that executives are being bonused on. But they have no real strategy in place to fix the experience behind that number.

Having an A team of advisors including legal, financial, coach/mentor is very wise and cost effective. Isn&rsquo;t your dream worth it?</p><p> It was not surprising, although a long time coming, to read the 12/25/15 article in the LATimes titled Helping start-up leaders keep it together. The subtitle was more telling. A growing number of tech firm co-founders turn to therapists to resolve conflicts.</p><h3> Limited Liability Partnerships</h3><p> <br/> As a former therapist and coach to business partners for about 25 years, I have seen over and over again that the reason for the 70% failure rate of business partnerships could be reversed if the partnership had started on the right foot so to speak.</p><p> The main point at the outset is not to be so eager for a partner that you are willing to overlook red flags. The red flags have to do with you not being a good match in the first place. Maybe your values, workstyles, personal vision, and much more render you incompatible.</p><p> Or maybe you are a good match but because you haven&rsquo;t talked about every aspect of the business, your values, vision, division of responsibility and much more (spelled out in BPAT) you set yourself up for trouble.</p><p> The need for &ldquo;therapy&rdquo; or partnership coaching and the willingness to engage in it hopefully, at that point will be enough to save you.</p><p> Take your time in &ldquo;the getting to know each other&rdquo;, in great detail, phase. That means you have had all of the discussions, made the decisions and most importantly built the trust, respect and commitment to each other as much as to the business. Now is the time to see a lawyer.</p><h3> Limited Liability BPAT</h3><p> <br/> With the completion of the BPAT you now have most of what the lawyer will need to set up a partnership agreement and the legal entity, such as a limited liability entity with a limited liability operating agreement. You will discover the difference between a general partnership, which you have by default unless you make another choice as a result of a lawyer consult.</p><p> A word of caution. It is true that the internet offers free partnership agreements and do-it-yourself docs to set up your LLCs, joint ventures and a variety of other projects.</p><p> You may be all right using some of them, but none of them address the uniqueness of your partnership and business. They most likely do not address specific laws of your locale and unfortunately, some of the templates have mistakes. Care enough about your dream to consult the best professionals.</p><p> Investing at the outset in setting up both your relationship and business entity is as one of my clients called it &ldquo;chump change&rdquo; compared to what you will lose if there is a nasty breakup because you didn&rsquo;t invest.</p><p> The old adage, which pre-dates today&rsquo;s start-up partnerships, is however, still wise in its simplicity. &ldquo;Penny wise and pound foolish&rdquo;.</p><p> The definition from the Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus is to be extremely careful about small amounts of money (spending now) and not careful enough about larger amounts of money (that savings will cost you later)</p><p> After you are sure you are a good match, consult with your lawyer to set up your limited liability partnerships or something different, based on legal advice.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 21:32:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 21:32:48.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_YQiZ1yK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-2016-perspective-on-limited-liability-partnerships/\", \"post_id\": \"8550\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 21:32:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 21:32:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-2016-perspective-on-limited-liability-partnerships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8549\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4039\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016-Perspective-on-Limited-Liability-Partnerships-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"474\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452681900,"author_id":151,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3895,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Eight Powerful Thinking Habits of Great Rainmakers","link":"eight-powerful-thinking-habits-of-great-rainmakers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The great essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, &ldquo;The ancestor to every action is a thought.&rdquo; Clearly, if our thoughts are not organized and clear, our actions won&rsquo;t be either. Taking Emerson&rsquo;s idea even further, mastery is not just a function of learning some tools and techniques&mdash;it&rsquo;s also learning to  think  properly about your craft.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve studied and interviewed thousands of highly successful client-facing professionals who consistently outperform their peers, and I&rsquo;ve observed the specific skills and strategies they use to become trusted advisors to their clients. But there&rsquo;s more to their success than the specific types of questions they ask or the skill with which they listen. They also perform better because they  think differently  than their less-successful peers.</p><p> This is a major part of the difference between the good musician and the great musician. I play classical guitar, and even if I could perfectly imitate some of Andres Segovia&rsquo;s playing techniques, I still wouldn&rsquo;t sound like him because I am not able to think about and approach a piece of music the way he did. A master performer also has different habits of thought, and greater knowledge of the music, than I do. It&rsquo;s not just about their technique&mdash;it&rsquo;s also about how they  think .</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i4.createsend1.com/ei/r/B3/C57/F0C/csimport/Emerson.194648.jpeg\"/></p><p>  The essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson</p><p> <strong>  Here are eight habits of thought I have consistently observed in great rainmakers: </strong></p><p> <strong>  One: They define their role differently than their peers. </strong> Great rainmakers see themselves as being in the business of helping their clients accomplish their most important goals&mdash;period. Other &ldquo;experts for hire,&rdquo; in contrast, view themselves as in the business of fixing a specific problem or set of problems that clients may have.</p><p> By defining your role as improving your client&rsquo;s business&mdash;in any and every way possible&mdash;you see and hear things differently. You define the available market for your services as being large, not narrow and circumscribed. Rather than run away from a discussion where you feel you aren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;expert,&rdquo; you jump in with a few well thought-out questions. You may then bring in a colleague who does have the necessary expertise&mdash;or, you may ultimately tell the client that it&rsquo;s not in your sweet spot. But either way, you have positioned yourself very differently than your competitors.</p><p> <strong>  Two: They focus on abundance&mdash;on possibilities&mdash;not scarcity. </strong> This is a key difference, which I observed and wrote about 15 years ago in  Clients for Life. Here&rsquo;s what I mean: I once had an idea to develop a seminar on how the Beatles worked together as a team and innovated their music. I also began writing an article on the subject. Several knowledgeable people advised me that it was a silly idea and tried to discourage me. They said the music business was dirty, that musicians took a lot of drugs, and besides&mdash;what could business people learn from a group that broke up 40 years ago? I pursued it, however, and it became and still is one of mymost popular workshops. And, the article I wrote for strategy+business became my most widely reprinted and downloaded article ever, with coverage in the  New York Times  and other important media all around the world.</p><p> Who do you want as an advisor: someone who is a chronic naysayer or someone who encourages you (while of course not steering you off a cliff&hellip;)?</p><p> Professionals with an abundance mentality look for opportunities, growth, and expansion. They are positive and upbeat in their demeanor. They encourage others. They feel that there are rewards enough to go around for everyone&mdash;they know that a &ldquo;rising tide&rdquo; lifts all boats.</p><p> When you have a scarcity mentality, you are primarily concerned with what might go wrong and what won&rsquo;t work&mdash;you&rsquo;re risk-averse. You focus on the downside of new proposals rather than the potential rewards. You believe that life is a zero-sum game, with a limited amount of opportunity to go around. You hesitate to make investments that don&rsquo;t show an immediate return.</p><p> <strong>  Three: They combine a long-term perspective with a great sense of short-term urgency.  </strong> This is a fascinating and powerful combination of opposing behaviors. The really successful client advisors I have studied all take a long-term perspective. Their time horizon for building relationships is long&mdash;basically the rest of their career, which could be 20 or 30 years. So if the client isn&rsquo;t ready to do business today, they don&rsquo;t fret it&mdash;rather than getting upset, they continue to stay in touch and slowly build a relationship over time based on continuous value-added.</p><p> At the same time, they have an intense sense of urgency and a drive to win when an opportunity presents itself. They are all over a potential deal, 24/7, and won&rsquo;t rest until they&rsquo;ve given it their best shot and exhausted all possible strategies for winning. They are relentless.</p><p> By simultaneously focusing on both the short term and the long term, great rainmakers fill their coffers today and also build the foundations for a strong leadstream in the future.</p><p> <strong>  Four: They align with the client&rsquo;s highest-level agenda, rather than accepting the immediate symptoms. </strong>  Back when I was a senior partner at Gemini Consulting, I remember walking out of a sales call with our global head of business development, Jim Duffy. Jim asked me what I thought the opportunity was. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a nice strategy project here for about $300,000,&rdquo; I told Jim. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear that at all. I heard that they need to transform their whole business model, and that&rsquo;s a multi-year, multi-million dollar effort.&rdquo; And ultimately, it turned out he was right! Because my focus at the time was strategy and organization consulting, I only &ldquo;heard&rdquo; that level of the client&rsquo;s agenda. I focused on the need as narrowly described by the client, not their broader business goals. My colleague, on the other hand, focused on the higher-level agenda. As a result, he was selling very large, high-impact programs. By shifting the way I defined (or reframed) my clients&rsquo; issues, I more than doubled my own sales over the next couple of years.</p><p> <strong>  Five: They truly, deeply believe the client needs them.  </strong> Great rainmakers believe that they have an incredibly valuable solution to offer clients, and that clients need it&mdash;badly. They don&rsquo;t approach prospects with a defensive, doubting, or insecure frame of mind&mdash;feeling that, even before they walk in the door, the client probably won&rsquo;t want or need what they can provide. They feel it&rsquo;s a crime when clients don&rsquo;t buy from them. They are genuinely shocked and saddened when someone purchases a competitor&rsquo;s inferior offering.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the point: This attitude motivates them to be persistent and not give up, it instills confidence, and it kindles an enthusiasm that is contagious. Remember, if you don&rsquo;t have a rock-solid&mdash;even exuberant&mdash;belief in what you can do for clients, why should they believe you can help them?</p><p> <strong>  Six: They see the entire chessboard, not just a few pieces.  </strong> Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is a great example of someone with the ability to visualize and manage multiple stakeholders. He conceptualized a triangular balance of power between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, which was obvious in hindsight but almost unthinkable at the time. Other leaders focused on the United States&rsquo; individual relationships with each country, whereas Kissinger thought about the whole chessboard. In 1968, Russia was the major threat to the United States, whereas China was a pariah, a political outcast. Kissinger felt that a rapprochement with China would pressure the Soviet Union into moving closer to the United States, and subsequently force all three nations into a more stable relationship with more closely aligned national interests. Both Russia and China, he believed, would seek acommon bond with the United States. This strategy was neither intuitive nor obvious at the time; in fact, there was great resistance in the State Department and in other quarters to meeting with the Chinese at all.</p><p> Similarly, the most successful rainmakers think about building multiple stakeholder relationships across the organization, not just connecting with one key executive. In chess terms, they will be as concerned with the pawns, knights and bishops as with the rooks, queen, and king.</p><p> <strong>  Seven: They integrate an understanding of the rational, emotional, and political.  </strong> Most professionals believe that clients will make a decision based on a rigorous examination of the facts and an assessment of who has the best product or service. Great rainmakers know that nothing could be farther from the truth. Clients make decisions based on a blend of analysis, their own emotional needs and perceptions, and the political dynamics in their organization. &ldquo;Facts tell, emotions sell.&rdquo; Your solution may look best on paper, for example, but a client may not feel as comfortable about working with you and your team&mdash;or, they perceive some risk factors in using you that tilt the scales to your competition.</p><p> <strong>  Eight: They are always thinking about their clients.  </strong> The most successful advisors I have studied are almost obsessively client-focused. They think about their clients all the time, and are always pondering what more they can do to help them. When they read something, learn something new, or meet someone, they always screen it through the lens of their clients&rsquo; needs and interests. This leads to a steady stream of ideas, introductions, and small communications that keep them in regular contact. <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s essential to learn new skills, tools, and techniques. But don&rsquo;t stop there. By adopting these habits of thought, you can dramatically transform your success with clients.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 21:41:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 21:41:39.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_vJWiPPJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/eight-powerful-thinking-habits-of-great-rainmakers/\", \"post_id\": \"8552\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 21:41:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 21:41:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"eight-powerful-thinking-habits-of-great-rainmakers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8551\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4040\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/8-Powerful-Thinking-Habits-of-Great-Rainmakers-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"656\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452747600,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

While waiting in line for that tall, skinny latte or straight up Americano, did you consider why your coffee purveyor and other companies like Disney, Apple and Nike are so incredibly successful at establishing and keeping customer loyalty while others seem to shutter their doors only after a few months?</p><p> Consistency could very well be what drove you to your favorite coffee spot today. I know it works for me. When I head to Starbucks I know my short, flat, white will be delectable, and my dog, aBoo, will receive her consistently delicious <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TgcJGO05RI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   puppaccino  </a> </u> . (Yes, that is a link to a video of my dog.)</p><p> Almost every client and customer loves consistency. They enjoy knowing what to expect and come to expect what they know. The mega companies understand the power of consistency; there are diligent about their brand &ldquo;experience&rdquo; &ndash; and work to have it permeate everything they do.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://shoefitts.com/first-impressions-are-lasting-impressions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Several years ago  </a> </u> , I had the opportunity to see Michael Eisner, former CEO of Disney, speak at a conference. In his speech, he metaphorically likened a consistent brand experience to a series of very small dots &ndash; somewhat like pointillism &ndash; creating an overall image of the organization.</p><p> What if we were to look at our brand as a series of pointillism dots creating an overall image or feeling of our firms? We have the ability to focus our image just as Disney does and we have the potential to grow to heights just as impressive. (It all starts with just one dot&mdash;one clearly defined dot.)</p><h3> Consistency and Influence <br/>  </h3><p> Interestingly a book written in 1984 provides the perfect scientific foundation for the importance and validity of brand consistency: Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion  by Robert Cialdini. In the book Cialdini reveals his six principles of influence: consistency, reciprocity, liking, authority, social proof, and scarcity.</p><p> Cialdini confirms scientifically what Eisner knew intuitively, &ldquo;a high degree of consistency is normally associated with personal intellectual strength&rdquo; while someone whose actions are inconsistent is considered &ldquo;indecisive, confused, two-faced or worse.&rdquo; Consistency confirms to your clients and prospects that you&rsquo;re reliable, trustworthy &ndash; and possibly even smart!</p><p> In fact, consistency is one of the reasons I recommend sticking with a single social platform until you've nailed it. Nothing is worse than being inconsistent across multiple social platforms. (If you chose one, <u>  pick LinkedIn </u> .)</p><p> When I <u>  <a href=\"https://shoefitts.com/speaking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   speak  </a> </u> , I often share what I believe is the magic of marketing: content, contact and consistency.

{"original_id":3897,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Remember to Breathe...","link":"remember-to-breathe","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve been practicing yoga for over 10 years. It&rsquo;s amazing how many times in a typical yoga class the instructor reminds us to breathe because when we get stressed, we either forget to breathe or we go into shallow breathing. The problem is this: humans aren&rsquo;t able to automatically discern when we&rsquo;re being threatened. Shallow breathing is an automatic, physical response to any type of stress (including a challenging yoga pose). By learning to alter our breathing, we&rsquo;re able to find that place of calm than can de-stress even the most difficult situations. That&rsquo;s why I practice yoga. By the end of class, the  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana\" target=\"_blank\">   shavasana  </a> </u> , makes me feel refreshed and replenished for the rest of the day. It doesn&rsquo;t change the circumstances, but it helps me stay calm, focused, and on track.</p><p> Most of us could benefit from some calm-breathing techniques at the moment. 2016 hasn&rsquo;t started out on a very good foot&mdash;at least from the perspective of the stock market. On Monday, the Dow closed down 276 points, largely in reaction to a 7% drop in China&rsquo;s market. This, on top of 2015&rsquo;s flat market, has some investors wondering if their investments will recover this year&mdash;especially seniors who inevitably have less time to recover from a market downturn. That&rsquo;s what prompted this email from Daniel, a 75-year-old client I&rsquo;ve been working with for decades:</p><p> George,</p><p> Over the years, we&rsquo;ve always focused on the long term. I get it. But at my age, &ldquo;long term&rdquo; is relative. Can we talk about how much the bear market impacts my portfolio and my retirement income? I trust you have the answer. I just need to hear it from the horse&rsquo;s mouth so I can feel more secure moving forward.</p><p> Daniel isn&rsquo;t alone. Seniors count on a certain level of return to provide monthly income, which is why a flat or down market can feel pretty scary. To keep the fear at bay, here are my suggestions, straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth!</p><p> <strong>  1. Expect the market to overreact.  </strong> To keep things in balance, the market often overreacts to factors such as interest rates, global unrest (both war and economics), and the state of the US economy. But, like any pendulum, it swings back, usually at an equal rate. A huge market dip on Monday is often followed by significant gains in a day or two. Plus, even extreme swings are temporary. Yes, it&rsquo;s easier to have that perspective when you have years left to recover, but regardless, chances are good that things will balance out sooner rather than later.</p><p> <strong>  2. Decide what you can live with. </strong>  How you react to market swings is highly personal. &ldquo;Risk tolerance&rdquo; is as much about numbers (current age, life expectancy, portfolio size, etc.) as it is about your own personality. In 2015, regardless of your age or assets, it seemed there was no place to hide. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/index/DJIA\" target=\"_blank\">   Dow  </a> </u>  and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/data/markets/sandp/\" target=\"_blank\">   S&amp;P  </a> </u>  were down. The third quarter was dismal, including a bond market correction that wiped out &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; gains. In this environment, deciding you can live with volatility is key. Sure, you can pull out of the market and opt for 1% return (after your market losses), but that&rsquo;s rarely wise (just ask anyone who pulled investments out of the market in 2008). If you can stomach the new-normal of constant volatility, you&rsquo;ll likely be better off 12 months from now. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t worry too much about China. </strong> Or the Middle East.When China&rsquo;s market declined 43% last summer and the US market responded, some investors panicked and pulled their money&mdash;only to watch the markets climb back up almost immediately. (For more on the China situation, see my  <u>  August 26 blog </u> . Nothing has changed.) Yes, China&rsquo;s economy may be impacting the world markets, but only in the short term. The same is true whenever happenings in the Middle East&mdash;oil prices, violence, and political unrest&mdash;throw investors sideways, but things typically return to business as usual once the dust settles. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. The Fed is built to make rational decisions.  </strong> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/43752521\" target=\"_blank\">   US Federal Reserve  </a> </u>  raised interest rates in December, which was an indicator of the growing economic strength of the US. (See  <u>  last week&rsquo;s blog </u>  for more on the economy.) The fact is that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/janet-yellen/\" target=\"_blank\">   Janet Yellen  </a> </u>  isn&rsquo;t the lone decision maker when it comes to raising rates. The process includes lots of number crunching, debate, and proven rationale. As a result, the Fed hasn&rsquo;t been wrong about when to raise rates. Ever. Having their fingers pointing toward a growing economy bodes well for stocks in 2016.</p><p> <strong>  5. Control what you can: </strong>  If last year&rsquo;s flat market has left you with a less-than-optimal outlook on your retirement income, now may be the time to crank up your investment in stocks. Sound crazy? It&rsquo;s actually an ideal way to leverage the situation and increase your growth potential. With stocks currently &ldquo;on sale,&rdquo; adding more to your portfolio now could potentially result in a 6, 7, or even 8% return in the coming year&mdash;which is a great way to help your portfolio catch up after last year&rsquo;s lackluster performance. I believe stocks will be tomorrow&rsquo;s bright spot.</p><p> Ultimately, I trust the market. I trust the wisdom of diversification and using managed portfolios that take a close look at the ever-changing factors that impact the prices of stocks and bonds and then identify hidden opportunities for delivering an optimal return balanced with risk. It&rsquo;s a rare case when pulling assets out of the market makes sense. Keep emotion out of your investment decisions as much as possible and breathe, two more breaths, breathe&hellip;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/the-meaning-of-quot-namaste-quot/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Namaste  </a> </u> .</p> ","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 22:01:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 22:01:13.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_hylBYNM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/remember-to-breathe/\", \"post_id\": \"8556\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 22:01:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 22:01:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"remember-to-breathe\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8555\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4042\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Remember-to-Breathe....png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1027\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452715200,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}

Competitors, customers, suppliers, employees and other stakeholders, they are all influenced by the way you act and the other way around. The dynamics of the environment that surrounds your business should be defining how you set up your processes. This ecosystem requires you to clearly position yourself.

But, culture is also an outward exuberance spanning customers, partners, and ecosystems that believe in it as much as the citizens and creators of that vision.&rdquo; (Kaan Turnali &ndash; SAP)</p><p> Before you start changing, make an effort to understand the history and traditions that anchor the current culture. Do not take them for granted, when people feel closely connected you will lose a lot of engagement before you even started your cultural change programme. If you want to make change happen, make sure your story inspires and explains what is in it for every party involved. Ensure that every employee understands the place in this ecosystem you want to position your organisation in. Don&rsquo;t just transmit, listen to the stories your employees tell you. These stories probably contain great ideas. Create an environment where everyone feels they have a chance to speak up. Being heard creates a sense of ownership and empowerment to change from the bottom up.</p><h3> Position <br/>  </h3><p> In almost all cases, culture shift starts with leaders and their vision. Be convinced of your own vision. Carry out your thoughts and opinions. Life by them and collect supporters amongst management and employees. It is important to get the buy-in from all involved people within the organisation in this early stage. If you are able to let your vision shape the role you want your business to play in the ecosystem, the largest part of your process set up is already identified. Fill in that role by strategies that drive innovation as a natural part of your business. Who are your customers? Listen to them. You need to know how you can engage your customers in the product innovation.</p><p> Who are your competitors? Watch them, but don&rsquo;t copy blindly. Stay true to your vision. And let (potential) customers tell you what improvements and innovations are needed. When you are true to your own believes, followers will connect with you and start incorporating your vision as loyal collaborators. To maintain the advantage on your competitors, you need to use your customers&rsquo; engagement to differentiate yourself. </p><h3> Share <br/>  </h3><p> Share results. What was the result of all the effort employees have put in a project? Or what are the outcomes of the panel discussion or questionnaire customers and suppliers took part in? Most important of all, share successes! Credit others for their contribution, than they will keep on helping you being successful. This is an important pillar for innovation. Of course, there will always be that moment that you are disappointed by someone. Don&rsquo;t let it be a reason to stop sharing.</p><p> An innovative culture doesn&rsquo;t grow overnight, it is something that needs to grow over a longer period. It is important leaders define the desired place in the ecosystem, than both set up the business and steer their own behaviour accordingly to begin with. What the end goal would be? Well, when people think of your brand, what role should they connect you with and what would your added value within the ecosystem be?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 22:39:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 22:39:58.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_lm7HneD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-ingredients-for-building-an-innovation-culture/\", \"post_id\": \"8563\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 22:39:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 22:39:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-ingredients-for-building-an-innovation-culture\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8562\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4045\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ingredients-for-an-Innovative-Culture.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"558\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452691800,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}

For three months, try investing 30% and see what happens&hellip;</p><h3> A Metaphor From the Deep <br/>  </h3><p> As I was doing a lot of underwater photography while  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/leadership-below-100-feet-leadership-scuba-style/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   scuba diving  </a> </u>  in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tourismbonaire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bonaire  </a> </u>  over the Christmas holidays, my mind kept moving to what a wonderful metaphor underwater photography is for employee development. So here&rsquo;s a bit of deep-dive reflection for you as you begin your 2016 developmental planning process.</p><p> <strong>  Be Still and Observe </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48c5bb99-4289-44d8-b7c0-b5306141ab63.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"48c5bb99-4289-44d8-b7c0-b5306141ab63\" src=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/48c5bb99-4289-44d8-b7c0-b5306141ab63-150x150.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Sometimes the biggest developmental needs are the least obvious. Invest the time to observe behaviors across a variety of contexts and situations. Where do they feel most confident? What scares them? How are others responding to their style? Where do they need to be challenged? In which areas do they need some additional training?</p><p> <strong>  Anticipate the Future </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s impossible to get a decent picture of a swimming fish by pointing the camera where the fish is, you&rsquo;ve got to anticipate where they&rsquo;re heading. It&rsquo;s the same with employee development. Great employee developers envision what their employees are capable of becoming and help people see themselves as more than they ever thought possible. Then they build the development plan with that lens in mind. <br/> <br/> <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7d29fce3-618b-4bd3-aa2c-a9586cb8504a.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"sting ray\" src=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7d29fce3-618b-4bd3-aa2c-a9586cb8504a-150x150.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  Be Patient </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/227c8ec9-14d9-4926-9290-648daf883743.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"lion fish\" src=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/227c8ec9-14d9-4926-9290-648daf883743-150x150.jpg\"/> </a> <br/> The hardest part of underwater photography for me is patience. My inclination is to chase the fish, which of course scares them. Sometimes it&rsquo;s important to move a little slower, to build confidence and incremental improvement.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no greater gift you can give your team then challenging them to become more than they ever thought possible.

{"original_id":3902,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Ways To Be More Resilient","link":"3-ways-to-be-more-resilient","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  As a child, I was shy and had a hard time taking credit for my achievements. When my Grandmother asked how I was able to accomplish something, I&rsquo;d shrug my shoulders and mumble something like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Her response was curt. &ldquo;Either learn to stand up for for yourself or be content to stand around sucking your thumb the rest of your life.&rdquo; </p><p> My lack of ability to stand up for myself disgusted my Grandmother. True, she could have been more sympathetic but she lived in a time and place where resilience was an essential component in surviving tough winters on a Wyoming cattle ranch.</p><p> She learned at an early age to value her skills and talents because she knew she&rsquo;d need them again&mdash;most likely in the near future. Taking personal responsibility for her contributions was not boasting; it was learning how to survive and be resilient.</p><p> Resilience is a component of mental toughness. It is the ability to take personal control and responsibility for the direction our lives are taking. Resilient leaders do not seek out happiness by relying on others, nor do they blame others for their situation.</p><p> Resilient people are always asking this question: what can I do to change my situation?</p><p> For entrepreneurs and business owners, it means believing that you can control the important events in your life. Often this will mean you will need to be flexible in the way that you approach your goals and agile in the way in which you overcome obstacles.</p><p> Here are 3 ways you can learn to be more resilient:</p><h3> 1. Become More Resilient By Focusing Your Energy On What You Can Control</h3><p> <br/> I watched as my Grandmother&rsquo;s cranky horse stretched out his neck, bared his teeth, and bit down on her left breast so hard that she had to have a mastectomy. But she was resilient&mdash;she knew while she couldn&rsquo;t control everything that came her way, she could absolutely control her response to it.</p><p> And that changes everything.</p><p> A major component of positive thinking is the belief that the future will be a more pleasant place because, to a large extent, we can control important events in our life.</p><p> In his book,  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003J5653Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Status Syndrome: How Social Standing Affects Our Health and Longevity  </u>  , </a>  Michael Marmot explains how clerks and secretaries are more likely to die of heart attacks than senior executives. </p><p> Even taking into consideration other variables such as smoking and poor nutrition, his research team concluded that those in lower category jobs had less control over their life, and the more likely they were suffer from heart disease.</p><h3> 2. Become More Resilient By Not Looking To Others To Provide Your Happiness</h3><p> <br/> When I was about 6 years old, I was given a tall black quarter horse to ride. The only way I could get on him was to lead him to a rock high enough that I could step into the stirrup. Horses are not stupid&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t take him long to catch on and he started shying away from the rock. </p><p> I would cry in frustration as everyone left me alone to deal with my problem. Although my Grandmother never graduated from high school, she asked me an incredibly wise question:  Why did I keep doing the same thing over and over even when it didn&rsquo;t work?</p><p> She was right. I had a self-limiting belief about what I could, and could not, do. From then on, I grabbed the leather ties hanging from the pommel of the stock saddle, pulled myself into the stirrup, and then into the saddle seat. </p><p> To be resilient is to recognize that if you are continually dissatisfied with aspects of your life, then it is your responsibility to take the initiative and rewrite the self-limiting beliefs you have about yourself that keep you chained to repetitive thinking and behaving.</p><p> Try this:</p><li> List 3 things in your life you would like to change.</li><li> List steps taken in the past to make these changes.</li><li> Why do you think you were unsuccessful?</li><li> What is a self-limiting belief you have about yourself?</li><li> What steps will be required for you to change this self-limiting belief?</li><li> What obstacles might interfere with these steps?</li><li> What is your backup plan? <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Become More Resilient By Finding Your Zones Of Competence</h3><p> <br/> As a child, I needed to learn acceptance, not narcissism, was the path toward a resilient mindset that accepted ownership for my achievements.</p><p> Once I was able to claim ownership for my zones of competence, it didn&rsquo;t hurt so bad to let go of those areas in which I was not as competent. My confidence was not shaken when I was asked to drop choir class because I sang so off-key it was disturbing the other kids!</p><p> If we believe that chance or luck is responsible for our achievements, then we march through life believing we have no control over our destiny. We develop a victim mentality.</p><p> Once we realize that we are responsible for our success, we also experience more satisfaction when we do attain our goals. </p><p> Resilient people believe that problems can be solved, the solutions must be found within themselves, and success is not about self-glorification.</p><p> How have you learned to be more resilient?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 22:50:10.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 22:50:10.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_y8i38MI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-ways-to-be-more-resilient/\", \"post_id\": \"8567\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 22:50:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 22:50:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-ways-to-be-more-resilient\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8566\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4047\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Be-More-Resilient-.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"413\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452697200,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

Are you asking for permission when you need an opinion, or are checking status on something and even when you want to know if someone is feeling ok?

Whether the applicant knows it or not, these programs use algorithms to sift through applicants, meaning that many resumes, however stellar the candidates may be, may never even see a pair of human eyes. </strong></p><p> These programs act as gatekeepers to sift through the deluge of resumes that often flood the inboxes and job websites of companies looking to hire new talent. The programs are supposed act as an objective gatekeeper and impartially allow only the most qualified and relevant jobseekers&rsquo; resumes to get in front of those human hiring managers and HR professionals.</p><p> However, National Public Radio&rsquo;s Science Friday program recently featured a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/why-machines-discriminate-and-how-to-fix-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussion  </a> </u>  of hidden bias in algorithms designed to screen resumes and job applications. During the segment, data researcher Kate Crawford argued that big data sets and the algorithms that sift through them can be just as biased as human beings.</p><p> Big data sets may seem to provide a platform for unbiased recruiting, because we assume statistics should dictate that any inherent bias is diluted by the sheer number of data points involved. However, those data sets are the product of our society and culture, which means they can carry along the very same biases inherent in our everyday lives.</p><p> One example Crawford gives is <strong>  algorithms that take an applicant&rsquo;s address into consideration when screening for new hires. </strong> If an applicant lives far away from the workplace, data suggests they are more likely to leave or be fired within a year than applicants located closer to work. However, where a person lives is often highly correlated with other factors, such as race and socioeconomic status.</p><p> Fortunately, there are means by which to overcome the potential bias of such programs. NBC News recently ran a story by Julianne Pepitone called &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/computer-programs-can-be-biased-humans-n411046\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Can Resume-Reviewing Software be as Biased as Human Hiring Managers?  </a> </u> &rdquo; In the story, Pepitone discusses research by University of Utah associate professor Suresh Venkatasubramanian in which a test was designed to use a machine-learning algorithm to determine whether a resume-scanning program had the potential for bias. It works like this: if Venkatasubramanian&rsquo;s program is able to use the data provided to the screening algorithm to accurately predict an applicant&rsquo;s race, gender or other factors that have been explicitly hidden, there is a potential for bias. If such a potential is discovered, the data can be redistributed to mitigate this potential.</p><p> <strong>  The lesson here is that eliminating bias is not an easy task. </strong> Even when using advanced computer programs, bias can find ways to creep into our decision-making. This means it&rsquo;s that much more important to remain vigilant in heightening our awareness of hidden sources of bias.</p><p> Is your organization at risk of missing out on top talent due to unconscious automated bias? <strong>  Maybe it&rsquo;s time to put the human factor back into resume review. </strong> Be inclusive!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 23:02:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 23:02:18.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_YHkWATx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-automated-bias-keeping-you-from-finding-top-candidates/\", \"post_id\": \"8570\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 23:02:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 23:02:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-automated-bias-keeping-you-from-finding-top-candidates\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8568\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4049\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stop-Using-These-3-Words-in-Your-Writing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"351\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452704400,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3905,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Gold Got Its Groove Back","link":"how-gold-got-its-groove-back","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Who says gold lost its appeal as a safe haven asset?After five straight positive trading sessions last week, the yellow metal climbed above $1,100, its highest level in nine weeks, on a weaker U.S. dollar.. The rally proves that gold still retains its status as a safe haven among investors, who were motivated by a rocky Chinese stock market, North Korea&rsquo;s announcement that it detonated a hydrogen bomb last Wednesday and rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Here in the U.S., gold finished 2015 down 10.42 percent, its third straight negative year. Until the new year, sentiment appeared poor, and many gold bulls were finding it hard to stay optimistic.But after the price jump last week, large exchange-traded gold funds saw massive inflows, confirming a shift in investors&rsquo; attitude toward the precious metal.It&rsquo;s worth remembering that about 90 percent of physical demand comes from outside the U.S., mostly in emerging markets such as China and India. In many non-dollar economies, buyers are actually seeing either a steady or even rising gold price. The metal is up in Russia, Peru, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and many more.Note the differences in returns between gold priced in U.S. dollars and gold priced in the Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Canadian dollar, Russian ruble and Indonesian rupiah. <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-in-2015-gold-performed-better-in-non-dollar-currencies-01082016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"In 2015, Gold Performed Better in Non-Dollar Currencies\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-in-2015-gold-performed-better-in-non-dollar-currencies-01082016.png\"/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a> Gold demand in China was very robust last year. A record  <a href=\"http://lawrieongold.com/2016/01/08/full-year-2015-sge-gold-withdrawals-total-2596-t-19-up-on-previous-record-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   2,596.4 tonnes of the yellow metal  </u>  , </a>  or a whopping 80 percent of total global output for 2015, were withdrawn from the Shanghai Gold Exchange. As for the Chinese central bank, it reported adding 19 more tonnes in December, bringing the total to over 1,762 tonnes. Precious metals commentator Lawrie Williams points out, though, that China&rsquo;s total reserve figure is widely believed to be &ldquo;hugely understated,&rdquo; meaning the central bank might very well have much more than we&rsquo;re being told.</p><h3> Forget Interest Rates&mdash;Real Rates Are the Key Drivers of Gold</h3>Despite all the talk of rising interest rates in connection to gold, they&rsquo;re not a dominant driver of prices. Sure, rising nominal rates have tended to make the metal less attractive, since it doesn&rsquo;t pay an income, but the larger driver by far are real interest rates. When real rates drop into negative territory, gold has historically done well.As a reminder, real rates, important for the Fear Trade, are what you get when you subtract the consumer price index (CPI), or inflation, from the 10-year Treasury yield. As of January 6, the 10-year yield was 2.18 percent, while the 12-month CPI for November&mdash;December data will be released later this month&mdash;came in at a barely-there 0.50 percent. Real rates, therefore, are running at a positive 1.68 percent, which is a headwind for gold.That&rsquo;s why we need inflation to pick up, because then gold would be more likely to rally.Regardless, the <u> <a href=\"http://www.gold.org/investment/gold-investment-research\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  World Gold Council (WGC) </a></u> writes in its 2016 outlook that gold&rsquo;s role as a diversifier remains &ldquo;particularly relevant&rdquo;:Research shows that, over the long run, holding 2 percent to 10 percent of an investor&rsquo;s portfolio in gold can improve portfolio performance.The reason for this is that gold has tended to have a low correlation to many other asset classes, making it a valuable diversifier. During economic contractions, for example, gold&rsquo;s correlation to stocks actually decreased, according to data between 1987 and 2015.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-since-1987-gold-has-had-a-low-correlation-to-other-assets-01082015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Since 1987, Gold Has Had a Low Correlation to Other Assets\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-since-1987-gold-has-had-a-low-correlation-to-other-assets-01082015.png\"/> <u>  click to enlarge </u></a>For the last three years, gold has disappointed many because other investments, specifically equities, have seen such huge gains. But with global markets hitting turbulence, the yellow metal is looking more attractive as insurance against the currency wars.I always recommend 10 percent in gold: 5 percent in gold stocks or an actively-managed gold fund, 5 percent in bullion and/or jewelry. It&rsquo;s also important to rebalance every year.This should be the case in both good times and bad, whether gold is rising or falling. As highly influential investment expert Ray Dalio said last year: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t own gold, you know neither history nor economics.&rdquo;<h3> USGI Among the First to Discuss the Significance of PMI as a Forward-Looking Indicator</h3>Aside from real interest rates, gold prices are being challenged by weak manufacturing data around the world. China&rsquo;s purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) fell to 48.2 last month, down 0.4 points from the November reading. The Asian giant&rsquo;s manufacturing sector spent a majority of 2015 in contraction mode, managing to rise above the key 50.0 level only once last year, in February.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-china-manufacturing-still-in-cotnraction-mode-01082016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"China Manufacturing Still in Contraction Mode\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-china-manufacturing-still-in-cotnraction-mode-01082016.png\"/> <u>  click to enlarge </u></a>Although fears of a Chinese slowdown are real, they&rsquo;re largely overdone. Consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company&rsquo;s Gordon Orr <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/what_might_happen_in_china_in_2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  calls these fears a distraction </u> ,</a> writing that &ldquo;the country&rsquo;s economy is still massive&mdash;as are its potentional opportunities.&rdquo;Something to keep in mind is that China recently approved a new five-year plan, its 13th since 1953. Although we won&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s in it until March, we do know that these plans have been good for economic growth in the past. It&rsquo;s likely that interest rates will be trimmed even more to stimulate business, with more funding diverted to infrastructure and &ldquo;green&rdquo; initiatives.Manufacturing around the world showed signs of deterioration in December as well. The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI declined to 50.9 from 51.2 in November. The sector is still in expansion mode, but just barely.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-global-manufacturing-cools-in-december-01082016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Global Manufacturing Cools in December\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-08/COMM-global-manufacturing-cools-in-december-01082016.png\"/> <u>  click to enlarge </u></a>The reading also fell below its three-month moving average in December, which, as I&rsquo;ve shown many times before, can have a huge effect on materials and energy three to six months out.We were one of the earliest investment firms to monitor this important economic indicator closely and bring it into public, everyday discourse. (From what I can find, the first time we wrote about it was in <u> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/e2809csigns-of-a-bottome2809d-in-china/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  January 2009, </a></u> as it applied&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you know?&mdash;to China.) Today, I hear and read about the PMI on the radio and in newspapers as often as I do more common economic indicators such as GDP and unemployment rates.That&rsquo;s a testament to the sort of cutting-edge analysis we do and pride ourselves on here at U.S. Global Investors.<h3> Looking Ahead in the New Year</h3>Until we see global synchronized growth with rising PMIs, we remain cautious going forward. A constant source of hope is the <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/how-these-12-tpp-nations-could-forever-change-global-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) </u> ,</a> which, when ratified sometime this year, will eliminate 18,000 tariffs for 25 percent of global trade.We also anticipate more stimulus programs this year around the world. Lately we&rsquo;ve experienced strong fiscal drag as more and more regulations and taxes impede progress that not even cheap money has been able to offset. A 2014 report by the <u> <a href=\"https://mafiadoc.com/the-cost-of-federal-regulation-to-the-us-economy-manufacturing-_597be4411723ddb28e072f6f.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) </a></u> revealed that federal regulations in the U.S. alone cost businesses more than $2 trillion a year. To ignite growth, G20 nations should commit themselves to cutting red tape.A good model for such a task is Canada&rsquo;s &ldquo;One-for-One Rule,&rdquo; introduced in April 2012 during former Prime Minister Stephen Harper&rsquo;s administration. The rule mandates that when a new or amended regulation is introduced, another must be removed.However it&rsquo;s accomplished, regulatory burdens placed on businesses must be reduced.For more in-depth analysis, consider subscribing to our award-winning newsletter, <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/subscribe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  the Investor Alert </u> .</a>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-12 23:08:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-12 23:08:38.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_JzAkcBA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-gold-got-its-groove-back/\", \"post_id\": \"8572\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-12 23:08:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-12 23:08:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-gold-got-its-groove-back\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8571\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4050\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Gold-Got-Its-Groove-Back.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"871\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452693600,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

But, it&rsquo;s not just the millennials overall, it&rsquo;s the 15.5 million affluent millennials that are on a hot streak and poised to inherit $59 trillion dollars over the next 20+ years. Affluent Millennials already have $100,000+ in investable assets, excluding real estate and they already spend $2 trillion annually. They do save 28% of their paycheck, unlike GenXers (born between 1966-1980) and they are optimistic about the future and making sacrifices now to reach long-term goals. This group is fired up to be successful AND have fun. Their motto is Work Hard and Play Hard, compared to previous generations that worked like crazy, barely took time for vacations and never really found that work-life-family balance. The affluent Millennials are mastering this balance already.</p><h3> Financial service providers face dramatic and historic changes over the next 20 years.</h3><p> <br/> An epic transfer of more than $59 trillion dollars in wealth to the 15.5 million Affluent Millennials will give them exceptional power as they reshape the future of the financial industry, business models and marketing strategies.

The financial advisors that want a piece of this $59 trillion better be ready also.</p><p> Sample Content of the Affluent Millennials keynote presentation:</p><li> <strong>  There are 5 primary factors AMs look for in financial service providers. </strong> Knowing these will help you succeed greatly.</li><li> <strong>  The AMs are progressive and have an optimistic outlook for their future. </strong> Their levels of trust and confidence are unparalleled.</li><li> <strong>  There are 77 million Millennials but only 15.5 million Affluent Millennials. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They are control freaks and want to conduct research within Social media before they make important financial decisions. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Social-centric and open-minded to non-traditional investments. </strong></li><li> <strong>  72% believe that the sacrifices they make now will pay off ahead. </strong></li><li> <strong>  3x more likely than GenXers to establish a charitable foundation. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They save a median 24% of each paycheck vs. 18% for GenXers. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They want complete control over their final financial decisions but 87% value guidance and support from financial advisors. </strong></li><li> <strong>  One-third of AMs don&rsquo;t have a retirement account yet. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Affluent Millennials are especially active on LinkedIn in these particular areas. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They are mastering the balance of work, life, health, relationships and fun. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> The vast majority of financial advisors in our country today are much older than the millennials, so there tends to be a communication gap between them.</h3><p> <br/> Many advisors have hired younger advisors at a similar age to the millennials, so that it&rsquo;s much easier for them to relate and communicate of course. What is your plan? It&rsquo;s a new year and a perfect time to make some important changes in your approach. If you have a team of advisors already, look at the diversity. There are many younger advisors, both female and male of course, that don&rsquo;t have the accounts and assets you have but do have the time, energy and drive to grow the business. The affluent millennials represent the ideal target market for the growth, but you&rsquo;ll need someone who can reach out and communicate with them on social media and other internet sites that they use for research. Imagine the exponential growth your team can experience over the next twenty years. Then imagine how you will feel if you miss that opportunity. Take action this month and see how much your team can accomplish this year.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 15:35:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 15:35:57.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_T8qkRlv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-affluent-millennials-are-ready-to-receive-59-trillion/\", \"post_id\": \"8576\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 15:35:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 15:35:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-affluent-millennials-are-ready-to-receive-59-trillion\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8575\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4052\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Affluent-Millennials-Are-Ready-to-Receive-59-Trillion.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1130\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452764700,"author_id":362,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3908,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How 2016 Can Be the Year of the Advisory Business","link":"how-2016-can-be-the-year-of-the-advisory-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Anderson  </a> </u></p><p> This article originally appeared on SEI's Practically Speaking Blog.</p><p> A few weeks ago, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seic.com/enUS/financial-advisors.htm?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SEI Advisor Network  </a> </u>  polled advisors around the county, asking for their  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/in-2016--advisors-brace-for-volatility--industry-changes-24291.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   New Year&rsquo;s resolutions  </a> </u> . In some cases, the responses were predictable. In others, it was very telling about the mindset of today&rsquo;s independent advisor.</p><h3> What we already knew</h3><p> <br/> It was no surprise to me that one of the top advisor resolutions was to grow their businesses in 2016 by increasing their referral networks. In fact, every year we have done this survey, I think &ldquo;grow by referrals&rdquo; is the number one or two resolution. What I find interesting is that this correlates with the personal resolutions that most of us make. This year, advisors also listed losing weight as the top personal priority &ndash; a resolution that I would bet they don&rsquo;t keep, either.</p><p> Building a referral network is hard and takes a long time (as is losing 10-20 pounds or more). It takes commitment, focus and effort &ndash; but more importantly, it takes a plan. Many advisors create full financial plans to help clients achieve retirement or education goals, but do little planning for their own business for growth.</p><p> Since this is the first week of the New Year, why not change your resolution? Resolve to create a plan to grow your referral network then execute. Work with your personal trainer (wholesaler, coach or practice management specialist) to keep you motivated and on track.</p><h3> Pessimistic, realistic &ndash; or both?</h3><p> <br/> As you start to dig into the survey results, some interesting trends begin to emerge. Throw out the standard &ldquo;lose weight&rdquo; and &ldquo;referral&rdquo; resolutions, and I think you get the picture of advisors who are worried about their business and coming volatile markets. Advisors told us they are going to increase the use of managed volatility products to help weather ups and downs in the markets, increase the use of goals-based investing, and implement better workflow systems. In other words, what advisors are saying is:</p><li> <strong>  The markets are going to be volatile and I want to potentially assuage client fears with a low beta equity approach. </strong></li><li> <strong>  By adapting goals-based planning and investment solutions, </strong> I can tap into behavioral finance and help my clients focus on goals, not the noise of the markets and the media.</li><li> <strong>  The more I adopt workflows (especially if integrated into my CRM), </strong> I can increase efficiency and potentially profitability, which will be important if gross revenues are down due to a flat or negative market. <br/>  </li><p> While I don&rsquo;t think that these advisors are predicting doom and gloom or a repeat of 2008, I think they are being realistic; 2016 could be a difficult year to manage investor behavior. If advisors are smart &ndash; and I think they are &ndash; they are trying to get ahead of the curve and help mitigate the emotional responses of their clients. And while I agree with the advisors in the survey, I don&rsquo;t think it is a time to be pessimistic. In fact, this may be the single best opportunity in years to really grow your firm.</p><h3> The optimistic advisory business</h3><p> <br/> Every year, when  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pricemetrix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PriceMetrix  </a> </u>  puts out its &ldquo;The State of Retail Wealth Management&rdquo; report, one of the first things I look at is the growth of the average advisor versus a simple 60/40 (S&amp;P/Barclay&rsquo;s Aggregate) benchmark. As far back as I can remember, the average advisor&rsquo;s growth was at or below the benchmark &ndash; which means that the advisor&rsquo;s growth was almost completely due to the market&rsquo;s appreciation. If this trend holds true and next year we have a down market, most advisors will see no growth in AUM or revenue for 2016.</p><h3> So the question is, what are you going to do about it?</h3><p> <br/> I have mentioned before that there is a difference between an advisory practice and an advisory business. Here is what I expect for each in 2016:</p><li> <strong>  The advisory practice will see choppy markets and emotional investors (whose natural reaction will be to circle the wagons). </strong> The practice will fire off a letter or two, maybe send an email or possibly make a proactive phone call to a client. It will bemoan the economy and politicians and agree with clients who want to &ldquo;try something else.&rdquo; Then, the practice will &ldquo;tighten their belts&rdquo; with regard to expenses, and limit their client contact (as they are fearful of questions that they can&rsquo;t answer), while waiting out the markets.</li><li> <strong>  The advisory business sees change as an opportunity to grow, and meet more prospects who can use their services (today). </strong> The business will be proactive with messaging around strategies that can reduce portfolio volatility. It will use goals-based planning and investing to manage client behavior and align itself with how clients actually think, instead of trying to talk about standard deviation or alpha. The business will market and ask for referrals, as unstable markets create questions in the minds of prospects. The advisory business will see an increase in activity, with new clients and prospects. <br/>  </li><h3> What is your resolution (for real)?</h3><p> <br/> If your peers are right about 2016, it could be a great time for an advisory business, and a bad time for an advisory practice. What type of business are you running? There is still time to decide.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 16:00:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 16:00:46.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_3I5GMUA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-2016-can-be-the-year-of-the-advisory-business/\", \"post_id\": \"8578\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 16:00:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 16:00:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-2016-can-be-the-year-of-the-advisory-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8577\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4053\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-2016-Can-Be-the-Year-of-the-Advisory-Business.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"310\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452803100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3909,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Out With the Old: 5 Social Media Marketing Priorities for 2016","link":"out-with-the-old-5-social-media-marketing-priorities-for-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A New Year means a new start, and for marketers that means overhauling - or at least refreshing - your social media strategy as much as your eating habits and exercise regime.</h3><p> <br/> Thankfully, a recent Forbes article listed the top five social media efforts that both B2B and B2C marketers should be leveraging over the next 12 months to improve their relationships with their audience, and make even more of an impact.</p><p> So, what five things should be on your in 2016 to-do list:</p><h3> 1. Engaging with bloggers and other influencers</h3><p> <br/> If 2015 proved anything, it's that partnering with bloggers and influencers works. Figures from RhythmOne show that in the US alone, marketers made almost $7 in earned media value for every $1 they spent on influencer marketing; what's more, Nielsen research shows that 92% of consumers trust recommendations and earned media more than any other type of advertising. So this trend only looks set to grow bigger and better over the year ahead.</p><h3> 2. Live streaming</h3><p> <br/> Live streaming can be a highly effective marketing tool for any company. Whether it's a B2C company offering customers a 'behind-the-scenes' glimpse; a B2C company streaming helpful information on their product or service, or tips on how to use it; or a non-profit showing the impact they are making in real time, live streaming provides businesses with a unique chance to connect with their audiences and boost engagement.</p><h3> 3. Social media advertising</h3><p> <br/> It's important first of all to understand the difference between organic social media activity - i.e. posting on your brand's social page - and paid social efforts, such as paid advertising on sites such as Twitter and LinkedIn. Both practices can be used together, so it's not about one replacing the other - but if marketers aren't already adopting paid social advertising, they should get their strategy and budget in place ASAP.</p><p> Any B2B business that isn't already taking advantage of Linkedin 'Sponsored Updates', for example, is missing out on one of the most cost-effective ways of reaching vast new audiences in a highly-targeted and cost-effective way.</p><h3> 4. Deals and promotions</h3><p> <br/> Giving your social media followers the occasional special offer is one of the most effective ways to gain more followers and expand your audience base, meaning you'll increase brand awareness, too. According to eMarketer, most social media users don't just follow a brand because they like them, but because they hope to receive an added incentive or promotion - so give the people what they want!</p><h3> 5. Employee advocacy initiatives</h3><p> <br/> If you're having trouble getting outside parties to talk about your brand, why not use the people who know it best - your staff? Employee advocacy is usually cheaper and easier than other types of advocacy campaigns, and people tend to trust word-of-mouth recommendations even if it is coming from a member of staff. There are now several platforms that are used solely for this type of activity (my personal favorite is  <a href=\"http://www.everyonesocial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  'Everyone Social' </a> ), so there's no excuse not to give it a try in 2016. </p><p> What else will you be adding to your marketing to-do list in 2016?</p> ","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 16:19:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 16:19:15.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_n9U78Fj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/out-with-the-old-5-social-media-marketing-priorities-for-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8580\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 16:19:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 16:19:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"out-with-the-old-5-social-media-marketing-priorities-for-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8579\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4054\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Social-Media-Marketing-Priorities-for-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"543\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452790800,"author_id":492,"chart_url":""}

I merely mention this as a set-up to a story shared with me by my son.</p><p> Before I get too far into my son&rsquo;s story I have to offer a spoiler alert. This actually is a positive customer experience story AND it offers some important lessons for all of us seeking to drive customer loyalty.</p><p> Last week my son got married (which is very odd since I remember bringing him home from the hospital and certainly that couldn&rsquo;t have been that long ago). Back to the story&hellip;</p><p> Within 24 hours of my son&rsquo;s wedding in Colorado, he and his bride hopped onto a plane to return to Chicago. <strong>  They were traveling on Southwest Airlines on what is purportedly the &ldquo;busiest travel day of the year.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> At the gate prior to boarding, my son and his wife attempted to pay for a boarding upgrade. For those who don&rsquo;t travel on Southwest, boarding is primarily based on your check-in time and seats are first come first serve. In essence those who board in the A group have more seat choices than those who board in the B or worse yet &mdash; the C group.</p><p> As my daughter-in-law approached the gate agent to buy an upgrade, she showed the agent her boarding card in the 41st position of the C group and noted that she hoped to sit with her newly-wedded husband. Unfortunately, no boarding upgrades were available for purchase. Resigning themselves to be separated in middle seats for the duration of the flight, the couple prepared to board with their designated group.</p><p> This is where the people of Southwest shined. The boarding agent called my son and daughter-in-law up to board with families needing assistance (prior to the B boarding group) enabling the young couple to sit together. Toward the end of the trip, the flight attendants announced the newlyweds over the loud speaker, and adorned them with crowns made of peanut bags attached by coffee stir sticks (the bride also had a toilet paper veil).</p><p> In relating the story, my son noted &ldquo; <strong>  we felt like royalty and it wasn&rsquo;t about whether we had the money to be frequent flyers with Southwest, they did it because they were caring people who put themselves in our place. </strong> &rdquo;</p><h3> Setting aside that this happened to members of my family, let&rsquo;s look at 5 quick lessons all of us can take from this memorable customer experience&hellip; <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Great service is about empathy  </strong> &ndash; It involves putting yourself in the position of your customers</li><li> <strong>  Being kind is the most inexpensive way to consistently create memorable experiences. </strong> (Southwest gives away peanuts anyway &ndash; so there was no added cost for the crowns.)</li><li> <strong>  People will remember and talk about you when you practice small acts of caring. </strong>  (When my son posted this story on his Facebook page he had as many likes for the story as he did for their wedding pictures.)</li><li> <strong>  Positive experiences and fun drive strong emotional connections. </strong> (Southwest is known for empowering their people to be playfully themselves.)</li><li> <strong>  Every customer deserves to be treated like a &ldquo;king&rdquo; or &ldquo;queen&rdquo; whether those people can spend like one or not! </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Are you customers sharing stories about you like the one I just shared about Southwest?

The customer buys a product and requests it be shipped via one of the typical shipping companies like UPS, FedEx or USPS. The product goes out right away, but the shipping company fails to deliver on time. The customer calls the company and is obviously upset. Why was there a delay? Maybe it&rsquo;s a weather problem that caused the shipment to arrive late. Or, maybe it was just a glitch in the shipping company&rsquo;s system. Regardless of the issue, it was completely out of the seller&rsquo;s control. Not their fault, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can&rsquo;t take responsibility.</p><p> One other quick example, and this one came from one of our subscribers, Brad Mifsud in Australia. He has a law firm that specializes in real estate. Sometimes, in preparation for a &ldquo;closing,&rdquo; which is when all of the papers are signed and the property officially changes ownership, there can be delays due to the bank or some other party not delivering their paperwork on time. Whose fault is this? Brad&rsquo;s law firm, as good as it might be, has no control over the employees at other companies who may not act with the same urgency to meet deadlines as his firm does.</p><p> In both of these examples, the company and law firm had no control of the situation. Yet to the customer or client, it looks like they were at fault. So, what can a company do?</p><h3> The answer has two parts:  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/proactive-and-anticipatory-customer-service-do-and-know-before-your-customer-does/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   proactivity  </a> </u>  and communication.</h3><p> <br/> Proactivity means you find out the information before the customer does. For example, technology allows for packages to be tracked and alerts sent if there are delays. You&rsquo;ll know there is a delay before the customer does. Or you check with the bank to make sure all of documents will be processed on time, well before they are due. If for any reason there is a problem with delays (in both of these examples) it&rsquo;s time to move into part two, which is to communicate with the customer.</p><p> Let the customer know as soon as possible about any problems. Even though they may not be your fault, many times they will appear to be your fault. It&rsquo;s not your job to deflect blame. It&rsquo;s your job to let the customer know you&rsquo;re on top of it. You can email the customer and explain that because of a snow storm, there is a delay and when they can expect their package. A simple phone call can be made to let the client know that certain papers are being held up at the bank for whatever reason and that you&rsquo;re aggressively working with them to get the problem taken care of.</p><p> Once you communicate, even if the customer isn&rsquo;t happy with whatever the issue is, they will know that you&rsquo;re aware and on top of the situation. You&rsquo;re working to resolve an issue that isn&rsquo;t even your fault. The customer will appreciate this effort.

Research Backs the Value of Hitting the Reset Button","link":"slipping-on-your-2016-resolutions-research-backs-the-value-of-hitting-the-reset-button","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> At our New Year&rsquo;s party, a seriously fit friend went on disparagingly about the annual January influx of exercise wannabes at her gym.  Those annoying novices monopolizing equipment, oblivious to workout etiquette.  Yet she knew she would only have to endure this for a few weeks.  She&rsquo;s seen this before; most lose momentum at this point in January.  By the end of the month, she and the hard core members could reclaim the gym for themselves. </h3><p> <br/> Is that how your January has started, and how it will end?  You started with ambitious goals on one of the big three &ndash; your business, your fitness or your personal finances.  Followed by a burst of action?  Then a slow grind back to your 2015 habits?  Maybe you&rsquo;ve already applied the ubiquitous January advice on resolutions:  aim low; enlist supporters; set specific goals; and use an app or wearable gizmo to track and nudge you.  Yet you&rsquo;re still flagging?</p><p> You still have a chance to be the one that keeps going to the gym (and annoying my friend).  In fact, you have many chances to renew that burst of motivation that comes with a new year. </p><p> Let&rsquo;s go back to the transition from 2015 to 2016.  This is a major <u>  <a href=\"http://www.katherinemilkman.com/journal-articles/the-fresh-start-effect-temporal-landmarks-motivate-aspirational-behavior\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   temporal landmark  </a> </u> - a point, <u>  <a href=\"https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/389/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Professor Katherine Milkman  </a> </u> of University of Pennsylvania explains, at which we tend to see a division between ourselves as we were in the previous period and who we hope to be in the next period.  When we make this transition, we create a new behavioral account for ourselves, dumping our past bad behavior in a private &ldquo;before&rdquo; column.  Setting up a new account - the clean slate &ndash; energizes us to do better by acting in ways that are consistent with the new, positive self we envision.  And by wiping the slate clean, we&rsquo;re more likely to take stock of the bigger issues in our lives.  This also generates efforts to make the changes that count.   </p><p> We don&rsquo;t need hand signals from a sports referee or umpire to declare a new start.  Instead, we trigger our own &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.katherinemilkman.com/journal-articles/the-fresh-start-effect-temporal-landmarks-motivate-aspirational-behavior\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fresh starts  </a> </u> &rdquo;.  Like our passwords for our devices and accounts, we need triggers for our fresh starts that are personally memorable and strong.  Milkman&rsquo;s work on the &ldquo;fresh start effect&rdquo; shows how we can select the timing of our reset to improve our chances of succeeding with the changes we want to make. </p><p> Mondays, for example, show a more powerful fresh start effect than days later in the week.  Like the start of a new year, significant public transitions, such as the first day of spring, also have more impact on our success with new actions than random dates. </p><p> Since events such as the start of spring only occur once a year, we need to create our own starting points.  You can tap a deep supply of fresh starts in repeat personal events such as birthdays, anniversaries of anything that stands out for you (e.g., your first account over $XMM), or cultural or religious days of significance to you.  We can also put the less frequent events such as moving to a different firm to good use to create new accounts and prompt new behaviors.    </p><h3> You already use this reframing - giving new meaning to a situation - nearly every day. </h3><p> <br/> If you work in sales, you&rsquo;re an expert at turning prospects&rsquo; objections into reasons to buy your services.  Instead of framing their objections as a barrier, you engage with their concerns and guide them to the upside.  In financial services, you have many fresh starts to put to work on your behalf such as:  the start of a new financial quarter or the first day you&rsquo;re really, really finished with income tax season. </p><p> For example, a client chose the global offsite of her senior leadership team as her personal fresh start.  She and her team had been preparing for weeks for this gathering.  Already a strong temporal landmark for the business, she made it even more meaningful for herself.  This became her fresh start on more disciplined financial planning.   Other clients have used turning points such as rearranging office space, the September return from summer holidays, and medical appointments to declare their fresh starts. </p><h3> Looking ahead in 2016, where do you see your strongest candidates for your fresh starts? </h3><p> <br/> Your calendar already contains many opportunities to establish your personal temporal landmarks that will energize you to set up a new account for better behavior. </p><p> While you have this supply of possibilities on hand already, be prepared for some surprises in your year and ready to take advantage of them.  Remember the impossible-to-pronounce volcano in 2010 (Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull)? </p><p> Travelers were stranded for days on holidays and business trips.  Of a <u>  <a href=\"http://www.carolbraddick.com/pdf/braddick.leader.april2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   dozen executives I interviewed  </a> </u> , nearly all were desperate to recreate their pre-volcano work schedules as quickly as possible.  BAU, business as usual, suddenly became sexy. </p><p> Only one leader reframed his unexpected open time and declared a fresh start.  While it &ldquo;would have been so easy to reload the schedule with lots of meetings and calls&rdquo;, he instead took up longer term issues that he had been putting off.   An executive in financial services, he put his windfall of time into looking at the talent on his leadership team and accelerating a new product launch.  His fresh start affirmed &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a much better use of me and my time to be thinking about an innovative way to achieve a leap in growth, versus plod along at annual increments&rdquo;.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t need another volcano to regenerate that energy you had at the start of 2016.  Your fresh starts &ndash; for your business or for you personally - are already there in the year ahead.  Prove my friend wrong about the January wannabes, and declare another fresh start in your 2016.   </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 19:07:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 19:07:06.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_WzYe8wj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/slipping-on-your-2016-resolutions-research-backs-the-value-of-hitting-the-reset-button/\", \"post_id\": \"8586\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 19:07:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 19:07:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"slipping-on-your-2016-resolutions-research-backs-the-value-of-hitting-the-reset-button\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8585\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4058\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Research-Backs-the-Value-of-Hitting-the-Reset-Button.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"956\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452783600,"author_id":86,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3913,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Tips to Keep Meetings on Time and on Task","link":"5-tips-to-keep-meetings-on-time-and-on-task","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Only one thing is worse than a long, drawn-out meeting: a long, drawn-out meeting with no structure.  A great leader understands that it is easy for a meeting to slip into a pointless wasteland of opinions and trivial information. That&rsquo;s why being proactive is vital. Keep meetings on time and on task to show others that you respect their time.</p><h3> <strong>  How? Here are five guidelines: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Be sure you need to have a meeting.</h3><p> <br/> Can you have a quick gathering in the lunchroom with just those people involved for five minutes instead of a sit-down meeting? Can the issue be handled through an email? It is frustrating for anyone to attend a meeting that affects them in no way.</p><h3> 2. Start on time.</h3><p> <br/> When a leader says &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait a few minutes for those who are running late,&rdquo; it immediately signals disrespect to those who did manage to get to the meeting on time. This can easily encourage everyone to wander in when they can for the next meeting. Watch the clock and start your meeting on time to communicate respect for those who are there. You will also be informing those who are late what they can expect from meetings you run in the future.</p><h3> 3. Have a purpose that everyone knows.</h3><p> <br/> Every meeting should have a clear objective. Complete this sentence: Add the end of this meeting I want the team to ______. In order to accomplish this, send a written agenda of the meeting and the objective along with the invite. Your team will be able to come prepared and conserve time. An agenda helps everyone stay focused on the objective. Everything that happens in the meeting then should further that objective.</p><h3> 4. Use time wisely.</h3><p> <br/> Move the meeting along based on the agenda. Don&rsquo;t let people run down rabbit trails. Instead, say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discuss that at another time.&rdquo; If someone is talking too much, ask other people for their opinions. Have someone take notes. Address one issue at a time. Keep your eye on the clock and enforce the meeting&rsquo;s time limit. End on time. Many companies have back-to-back meetings, so if you go over your time limit, you are messing up someone else&rsquo;s schedule. At the end of the meeting summarize decisions made and tasks assigned. Leave time for this critical step so that your team knows what steps to take next.</p><h3> 5. Follow up.</h3><p> <br/> Using the notes taken, write a summary of the meeting and send it out to everyone. This summary will communicate that the meeting was productive. It will also help everyone to be on the same page as to what happens next. It will help those involved to have a sense of satisfaction about the meeting.</p><p> According to a survey of U.S. professionals by Salary.com, meetings ranked as the number one office productivity killer. Proactively fight this statistic by making sure your meetings stay on time and on task.</p>Sources:<br/><a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/RunningMeetings.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/RunningMeetings.htm</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2014/02/05/seven-steps-to-running-the-most-effective-meeting-possible/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2014/02/05/seven-steps-to-running-the-most-effective-meeting-possible/</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pam-stucky/how-to-run-an-effective-e_b_7674004.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pam-stucky/how-to-run-an-effective-e_b_7674004.html</a>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 19:53:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 19:53:05.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_287LLZK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-tips-to-keep-meetings-on-time-and-on-task/\", \"post_id\": \"8588\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 19:53:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 19:53:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-tips-to-keep-meetings-on-time-and-on-task\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8587\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4060\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Tips-to-Keep-Meetings-on-Time-and-on-Task.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"876\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452888300,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

They all sell products.</p><p> Unfortunately when it comes to financial advice, Australia&rsquo;s consumers don&rsquo;t know the difference between financial advice and financial products.</p><p> Advice doesn&rsquo;t provide the same tangibility of a physical product from the supermarket or even the same intangibility as a loan specifically to buy your new home.</p><p> In terms of tangibility, advice is more the invisible hand supporting or pushing you to financial objectives not yet reached or over obstacles not yet overcome. Or advice can be the &lsquo;helping hand&rsquo; holding yours providing the confidence for your next venture, adventure, challenge or simply your next step. Advice can stand on its own without products support not losing any of its value, in fact, often being enhanced without the need for product.</p><h3> The quality of advice is harder to compare than the quality of products.</h3><p> <br/> Whilst attempts to compare advice based upon price are easy, these are usually so full of assumptions that an impartial assessment are near on impossible. Like beauty and art, the quality of advice is usually a subjective judgement for the receiver of advice. Similar to health, engineering, and law, it&rsquo;s the adviser, rather than the specific advice that provides the DNA upon which all an assessment of quality is formed. It&rsquo;s easier to buy a great product from a dud salesman, than buy great advice from a dud adviser. Advice doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p><p> Comparing the value of advice and value of products is like comparing religions. There is no logical start or end to that consideration. Fundamentally the only real comparison is that they are different &ndash; very different, and should not be confused as the same.</p><p> I believe the people who treat advice as a product are taking a shallow view because it&rsquo;s usually in their self-interest.</p><h3> Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) takes this path.</h3><p> <br/> General &lsquo;advice&rsquo; or personal &lsquo;advice&rsquo; definitions have been crafted by those who consider Australia&rsquo;s financial advice world as a flat, product-strewn landscape. So too the reporting of Commonwealth Bank&rsquo;s financial planning fraud which was based upon the assumption that those acting dishonestly were &lsquo;advisers&rsquo;. They were never advisers, but product-remunerated sales people</p><p> Come next crash, next scandal, next government, next scary world-event, or next expected or unexpected financial event in life, consumers will come looking for different, better financial solutions to an age-old problem &ndash; the search for greater financial certainty.</p><p> The delivery of greater certainty isn&rsquo;t based upon delivery of more products, it never has been. It&rsquo;s about the delivery of better advice.</p><p> Whilst the delivery of better health advice often relies upon the delivery of better drugs, the differences between health advice and drugs are better recognised by consumers as separate.</p><p> The separation of financial advice and financial products is easy and is happening today with good advisory firms &ndash; they reimburse any payment from products or product-providers to their clients and charge their clients directly in dollars for the value of their advice. Nor do these firms enter into &lsquo;guaranteed buy-back&rsquo; arrangements with product manufacturers (i.e. banks and insurance companies) that value their business based upon quantity of products sold.</p><p> For those that continue to take their payment from products in any form (or tie their business valuation to a product manufacturer&rsquo;s buy-back) let&rsquo;s call them what they are &ndash; product providers. And lets stop referring to them as advisory firms or their people as advisers.</p><p> For the others &ndash; advisory firms pricing upon the value they deliver and separating themselves from any product bias either in their offerings or the models they use to build value in their businesses &ndash; let&rsquo;s refer to them as advisers.</p><h3> Advice isn&rsquo;t a product.</h3><p> <br/> What do you reckon?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 20:12:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 20:12:46.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_L6bZlmT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advice-isnt-a-product/\", \"post_id\": \"8589\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 20:12:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 20:12:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advice-isnt-a-product\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8587\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4061\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Tips-to-Keep-Meetings-on-Time-and-on-Task.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"454\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452778200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Are you actively monitoring for distractions and filtering them out?</p><p> Whether you're running a Fortune 500 corporation, a pre-IPO start up, or a government agency, the simple formula of choose, transmit, and filter can make the difference between success and failure. In fact, many leaders who under-deliver on their goals or fail in their roles, do one or two of these things well, but not all three.</p><h3> Fixing Failure to Choose</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Here's what I hear when I interview the leader's colleagues: </strong> \"She says \"yes\" too often, and we end up having 10 big priorities -- that's too many, and we lose focus.\" And, \"He changes priorities too frequently. If it's a \"shiny object,\" then he wants to try it, and we're left saying 'What just happened?'\"</p><p> <strong>  Fix it: </strong> To deliver most effectively you first need to narrow down the universe of the \"important\" to a small number of key priorities that: a) are within your / your group's capabilities, b) will directly propel your organization or initiative to its overall desired goals within a set time frame, and c) will address and remove key obstacles along the way. These priorities need to be likely to remain as important a year from now as they are today, and highly correlated to your organizational strategy.</p><h3> Fixing Failure to Transmit Your Priorities</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Sounds like: </strong> \"He has a good idea of what he wants -- or we think he does -- but he's very guarded about them, so we're not at all sure where we're heading and why.\" And, \"I know she's got priorities, but I'm not totally sure what they are -- she needs to let everyone know what they are, so we're all on the same page.\"</p><p> <strong>  Fix it: </strong> To deliver most effectively once you have your handful of priorities, you now need to \"transmit\" them over and over -- and over again -- to all involved. Stay on message with them by returning to them in your future communication, social media, and other forums. Priorities are useless if they're clear in your mind but aren't drilled into the minds of the entire organization. Make your priorities their mantras.</p><h3> Fixing Failure to Filter</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Sounds like: </strong> \"She's an idea truck -- every month she'll dump off (or she'll get from HQ) the next batch of big ideas, and we end up changing tactics and strategies too often.\" And, \"He needs to hold the line on our priorities when the board is asking questions about alternatives. Just because they ask a question or challenge a strategy doesn't mean he should go change it.\"</p><p> <strong>  Fix it: </strong> Potential distractions to your key priorities are always trying to clot the arteries of your enterprise -- it's human (and organizational) nature. It's critical that you actively monitor for them and filter them out.</p><p> If the latest great idea or important initiative is not directly related to delivering one of your key priorities then it's your time to shine with a creative \"no thank you.\"</p><p> Filtering out potential and actual distractions before they impact the people doing your work - -having the \"managerial courage\" to say no to colleagues, higher-ups, or your board, whom you're more inclined to please than disappoint -- means you need to be creative to make sure they can absorb and agree to a \"no.\"</p><h3> To that end, and to say no effectively, you need to be careful. Remember that it's the task at hand AND the long term relationship with the person you've got to turn down.</h3><p> <br/> Provide them with plenty of context and rationale for the denial. Sometimes a flat out high-context \"no\" is the right thing, particularly when you think they'll absorb it well. In other cases -- as in dealing with a more autocratic board or CEO, it often needs to be a \"yes, that's a great idea, and we have to find the right time for it - if we don't want to interfere with the results we've shared with the marketplace, then it should be a next-year thing,\" or a \"yes, and here's what would happen to our results if we did that,\" or a \"yes, and here's what would be needed for that to happen.\"</p><p> Keep your own (and your team's) focus as clear as a bell: Choose, transmit and filter your way to achieve results, and your team will be more likely than not to stay on track and execute effectively.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 20:29:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 20:29:21.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Js8Cwvh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-magic-formula-for-distraction-subtraction/\", \"post_id\": \"8590\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 20:29:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 20:29:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-magic-formula-for-distraction-subtraction\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8587\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4062\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Tips-to-Keep-Meetings-on-Time-and-on-Task.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"512\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452762000,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3916,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways to Invest In Yourself This Year","link":"7-ways-to-invest-in-yourself-this-year","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s a brand new year, which makes it the perfect time to be thinking about ways to prioritize your own personal and professional development. Different than those stressful and often unfulfilled New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, setting yourself up for success this year can simply mean putting yourself first in certain areas and intentionally investing in yourself.</p><p> The better you are, the better you do. So why not prepare yourself for future opportunities that align with your talents and skills in a fulfilling way? It&rsquo;s time to make thoughtful investments in your most valuable asset: you!</p><p> Here are seven ways to invest in yourself so that you can be the best version of you yet:</p><h3> 1. Attend conferences that peak your passion <br/>  </h3><p> Conferences are not only a great place to learn, but they are also a great place to network with leaders in your industry and become known. Very seldom do people bloom into their best selves by keeping themselves shut away. And while the cost of conference tickets plus airline and hotel can add up, if you are thoughtful and strategic about which conferences to attend and why, and plan ahead for the costs by stashing away each month (or getting your employer to sponsor your attendance) you can ensure you get the very most out of them.</p><h3> 2. Start or join a mastermind group <br/>  </h3><p> Having been in multiple masterminds myself, I can say that the power of a mastermind group in invaluable. These groups bring people together who are passionate, excited and committed to help each other grow. They provide a &lsquo;safe space&rsquo; where participants help each other become better versions of themselves by challenging each other to set and meet goals, sharing ideas and supporting each other with honesty and respect.</p><h3> 3. Discover you <br/>  </h3><p> No matter how well you think you know yourself, going through a formal exercise of self-discovery is never a bad thing. Making the investment of time and a little money to rediscover your strengths, weaknesses and dominant personality traits is a healthy way to recalibrate in the new year and have a clear picture of where you are today versus where you might have been three years ago.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/Home/en-US/Index\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Gallup Strength Finder  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mbtionline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&reg; (MBTI)  </a> </u>  assessments are a great place to start in gaining a little more insight into what makes you tick, which can help you more effectively focus your time and attention in areas that you are more likely to succeed and enjoy.</p><h3> 4. Consider getting a formal mentor or coach <br/>  </h3><p> There is pretty much a coach for whatever area of your life you are most interested in improving: life coach, professional coach, money coach, health coach and so on. What they all have in common, however, is that they will work with you on an individual basis to help you reach your goals and overcome anything that you may be struggling with.</p><h3> 5. Establish a personal brand and online presence <br/>  </h3><p> Establishing your personal brand online will only serve you professionally. In a world that is connected 24/7, it&rsquo;s more important than ever that you create a positive perception of who you are when someone Google&rsquo;s your name. Ask yourself what people should know about you and what you want others to think of you.  Between all the social media platforms, share a consistent message of who you are and what you&rsquo;re all about.</p><h3> 6. Put some hustle in your life <br/>  </h3><p> Tap into your passions by turning them into a money-making business on the side. Maybe you have a full time job already, but it&rsquo;s not leveraging all your talents and abilities. If it&rsquo;s not possible to express certain passions you have from 9am to 5pm, use your other waking hours to.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to have ambitions of starting a Fortune 500 company in order to begin something that allows you to expend energy doing something you really love and, in turn, make some extra income in the process.</p><h3> 7. Learn what you don&rsquo;t know <br/>  </h3><p> Whether it&rsquo;s learning more about subjects that will enhance your professional growth and contributions or practical life skills, take the time to learn what you don&rsquo;t know and never stop learning.</p><p> There are thousands of free online college courses from accredited universities to keep your competitive knowledge of your industry sharp.  <u>  <a href=\"http://coursera.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Coursera.org  </a> </u>  is one such way to expand your knowledge for free.  The internet is full of resources, articles, blogs and videos on just about anything you&rsquo;d want to know.</p><p> Of course, one of the ongoing ways to invest in yourself is to get money smart and take control of your finances. All of these ways to invest in yourself this year have the potential to lead to more opportunities and higher income. Therefore, pay special attention to the finances that support your life and do what you can, now, to maximize the returns that may come your way.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 20:31:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 20:31:55.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_9gXtuIl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-ways-to-invest-in-yourself-this-year/\", \"post_id\": \"8592\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 20:31:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 20:31:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-ways-to-invest-in-yourself-this-year\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8591\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4063\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7-Ways-to-Invest-In-Yourself-This-Year-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1235\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452769200,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3917,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"You've Got A Fancy Website, Now What?","link":"youve-got-a-fancy-website-now-what","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Congratulations, you have a great new website. You&rsquo;re proud because you&rsquo;ve spent the last several months honing your new company messaging, updating the graphics and ensuring your website contains all of the latest tools and technology, creating fancy new content &ndash; and it looks awesome. You should be proud. But unfortunately, the work doesn&rsquo;t stop there. In fact, just having a great website doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing if people aren&rsquo;t coming to it and engaging with it. </p><p> So how does your company use your website, arguably one of your top marketing assets, to attract new visitors, engage existing contacts, and educate your target market? Here are a few suggestions from Derek Gehl,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/80220\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contributor at Entrepreneur Magazine  </a> </u>  (@Entrepreneur) and CEO of an internet marketing firm that has helped thousands of people learn to start and run their own online businesses.</p><h3> Step 1: Get the traffic you need to test your website fast!  <br/>  </h3><p> Focus on testing the basics of your site for starters:</p><li> Salescopy, especially your headline, benefits, guarantee and call to action</li><li> Order process, which needs to be simple enough for a novice web user to place an order</li><li> Opt-in offer, so you can determine if you&rsquo;re successfully capturing your visitors&rsquo; contact information</li><li> Site navigation, so you can figure out how many clicks it takes to buy. Ideally it should take less than three. <br/>  </li><p> These are the four critical aspects of your sales process that need to be tested before you start driving traffic. Later on, once you&rsquo;ve generated sales and have some steady traffic, you can move on to testing other parts of your site.</p><h3> Step 2: Get cheap traffic quickly with PPC advertising <br/>  </h3><p> The fastest way to ramp up traffic to your site is to roll out a Pay-Per-Click (PPC) campaign on a larger scale. </p><p> This is also a great time to get started with  <u>  <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/um/Welcome/Home?a=1&amp;authuser=0&amp;sf=og&amp;clickid=sn-3r-og-us-11172015\" target=\"_blank\">   Google AdWords  </a> </u> . With Google AdWords, you get instant traffic with zero waiting time. As soon as you put the money down on your keywords, your ad goes up and starts working for you.</p><h3> Step 3: Get free traffic from search engines like Google <br/>  </h3><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve bid on keywords for a strong showing in the PPC search engines, it&rsquo;s time to tackle the organic search engines and directories. Search engines like Google and directories like Yahoo! can still be a great source of free traffic for your website. The trick is getting a competitive ranking for your best keywords.</p><p> The first step in getting a top ranking in the search engines is to submit or suggest your site to them. In other words, you have to provide them with details about your site. You want to make sure that the &ldquo;spiders&rdquo; (which are automated programs that crawl the web indexing sites for the search engines) find your site and include it in the search results.</p><p> To submit or suggest your site to the major engines, follow the simple instructions they provide on these pages:</p><li> For Google, go to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl\" target=\"_blank\">   www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl  </a> </u></li><li> For Yahoo Directory, go to  <u>  <a href=\"http://docs.yahoo.com/info/suggest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://docs.yahoo.com/info/suggest/  </a> </u></li><li> For Yahoo! Search, go to  <u>  http://submit.search.yahoo.com </u></li><li> For MSN, go to  <a href=\"http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx  </u> </a> <br/>  </li><h3> Step 4: Give away irresistible free content for priceless publicity <br/>  </h3><p> Believe it or not, a really easy, frequently undervalued strategy for getting traffic is giving away free content to other websites. Yes, you read that right. Even just two or three well-written articles can generate truckloads of traffic, as long as they don&rsquo;t contain a sales pitch. You want to include rare, hard-to-get information that&rsquo;ll lend your articles automatic value &ndash; the kind of information that establishes you as an expert in your field.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve completed the article, write a short bio paragraph about you and your business and place it at the end of your article along with a link to your site.</p><p> Step 5: Get free word of mouth publicity using viral marketing</p><p> Simply defined, viral marketing is a way for you to spread your marketing message quickly. You encourage people to pass on information about your site to others, and you use that word-of-mouth publicity to advertise your business. Here are a few simple ideas:</p><li> Give away free articles that include a &ldquo;pass it on&rdquo; link</li><li> Give away free demos of your product</li><li> Offer a free trial of your service with a &ldquo;share this great resource&rdquo; button on the page <br/>  </li><h3> Step 6: Use email marketing to attract repeat visitors <br/>  </h3><p> Getting lots of traffic to your site is great, but if you aren&rsquo;t collecting the contact information (such as the names and email addresses) of visitors, you&rsquo;re wasting every single click. If visitors leave your site without buying your product, there&rsquo;s a good chance they won&rsquo;t ever be back.</p><p> Remember: It can take up to seven points of contact to make a single sale, so you&rsquo;ll want to begin collecting visitors&rsquo; contact information from day one using an opt-in form on your home page. Then send them emails to follow up and keep them thinking about your company, your products, and your services. Need some ideas for emails you could send to follow up with your opt-in subscribers? Try these ideas:</p><li> Monthly or bi-weekly newsletters that include tons of tips and information</li><li> Free reports on topics your market would appreciate</li><li> Answers to common questions people ask about your product</li><li> Offers for products similar or complementary to ones you may have already offered them</li><li> Free product trials that give potential customers a taste of what you have to offer <br/>  </li><p> We love that you&rsquo;re so excited about your new website &ndash; but don&rsquo;t get too caught up in its beauty without thinking through how you can activate your website to attract the right audience. After all, what good is a beautiful website without any visitors? </p><p> Learn how  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.torchlite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Torchlite  </a> </u>  can help your company ensure your website and all digital properties are being leveraged to their full extent.

Therefore in the spirit of fairness, a great article appeared on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/2016-bitcoin-best-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Coindesk  </a> </u>  last week by Tuur Demeester and I decided to finish this week&rsquo;s predictions series on his views of what will happen with bitcoin this year. Whether you agree or not, it&rsquo;s well worth the read.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tuurdemeester\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tuur Demeester  </a> </u>  is an independent investor, newsletter writer and editor in chief at Adamant Research. Launched in 2015, Adamant Research provides a monthly newsletter service.</p><h3> Why 2016 is bitcoin&rsquo;s year <br/>  </h3><p> 2015 was another rollercoaster year for bitcoin: incredible amounts of infrastructure development, lots of talk about &lsquo;the blockchain&rsquo; and the fierce scalability debate, all against the backdrop of a crash to $150, which was followed by a high of $500 (so far).</p><p> Let&rsquo;s reflect back on the ups and downs of bitcoin&rsquo;s financial history, and then we can look forward to the ride to come.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s my condensed take on the financial history of bitcoin:</p><p> 2009-2010: Conceptualization</p><p> This is the pre-history of bitcoin-the-currency, as there&rsquo;s hardly even a price for the tokens generated by the bitcoin software.</p><p> A lot of technical and economic discussions take place, and core developers patch a major vulnerability in the source code.</p><p> 2011: First bubble and experimentation</p><p> Several bitcoin exchanges compete for customers, with Mt Gox as the clear winner. Silk Road is launched, as well as payment processor BitPay, the stock exchange GLBSE and bitcoin sees its first price bubble &ndash; a rally from $1 to $30.</p><p> 2012: Gambling and leverage</p><p> After a couple major bitcoin thefts early in the year, the community senses a great need for better and easier storage of coins, and several new wallets are released in response to that.</p><p> The lack of excitement in the bitcoin price is compensated for by speculation with leverage (Bitcoinica), gambling (Satoshi Dice) and dabbling in altcoins (litecoin) and mining (Butterfly Labs).</p><p> 2013: Mining frenzy</p><p> After several obituaries by several large news outlets, bitcoin comes back from the dead with a major rally in the spring.</p><p> Spectacular stories of massive gains made by early adopters, in combination with the bootstrapping cottage industry of specialized hardware, cause a wave of attention for bitcoin mining.</p><p> This is further intensified by the rally during the last two months of the year, which takes bitcoin to over $1,000. The difficulty of the network jumps from 20 to 9000 Th/s in a year.</p><p> 2014: Altcoin distractions</p><p> Becoming aware of the disruptive potential of the technology, the VC world wakes up and uses 2014 to invest $300m in bitcoin startups &ndash; four times as much as the year prior.</p><p> Not all sectors in bitcoin fare well, though; speculative exuberance, overzealousness of hardware producers and the soaring hashrate of the network eventually cause the wheels to fly off bitcoin mining. The result is delivery cancellations, unprofitable hardware, and a slew of bankruptcies in the sector (I lost money in one of these.)</p><p> Facing a declining price of the currency and a mining capacity glut, a minority scoffs at bitcoin as being rigid, having a boring brand, not being local enough and having an inefficient mining network.</p><p> In response, a flurry of altcoins are promoted with the promise of solving these problems&hellip; or with no promise at all, such as dogecoin. Bitcoin investors readily jump on the perceived opportunity to diversify their portfolio, and 2014 becomes the stage for several significant altcoin bubbles.</p><p> Bitcoin in 2015: Blockchain hype and a maturing ecosystem</p><p> During another year of price decline and consolidation for bitcoin, many stakeholders suffer. Yet under the hood, a mighty powerful engine is starting to roar.</p><p> With limited new speculative interest and with 3,600 BTC being mined daily and sold into the markets, the bitcoin price stays depressed for most of the year. A substantial amount of bitcoin investors sell at least a part of their coins (often out of necessity rather than out of preference). Those coins then slowly move into the hands of new adopters and more dispassionate value investors.</p><p> Many bitcoin startups, often managed by inexperienced entrepreneurs, struggle to make it through the winter alive. The money raised in 2014 doesn&rsquo;t last a lifetime, especially if you can&rsquo;t escape the label of a &lsquo;pre-revenue&rsquo; company.</p><p> To give an idea of the dire straits some companies are in, I know an exec who was recently in talks with a bitcoin company he considered partnering with. At one point the manager of the bitcoin company casually admitted, &ldquo;You know, I think we&rsquo;re in a phase where we don&rsquo;t know if we should continue with the company anymore.&rdquo;</p><p> Meanwhile, the bitcoin mining industry goes through a shakeout phase, with many smaller miners throwing in the towel, much to the benefit of larger, low-cost operations. As a result of the economies of scale and a new generation of mining chips, the hashrate of the network climbs from 300 to over 600 petahash.</p><p> Throughout the price doldrums, bitcoin adoption continues, often through fringe case uses such as gambling, dark net markets and capital control-defying remittance. The result is a steady increase in transactions up to 3 per second (on a network supporting a maximum of 5-7 tps).</p><p> By the summer, this sparks a heated debate over how to sustainably increase bitcoin transaction volumes. It lasts until a widely attended Hong Kong Scaling Bitcoin conference in December, where a semblance of consensus seems to emerge.</p><p> Perhaps in part because of the discord and pessimism in the bitcoin community, a chant rises in the fintech world: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about bitcoin, it&rsquo;s about the blockchain.&rdquo;</p><p> The idea is that bitcoin is probably too volatile, rigid and radical, and that to bring innovation to the financial world, one needs private, more malleable blockchains with native tokens.</p><p> Nine banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays, announce a &ldquo;blockchain partnership&rdquo;. IBM starts developing blockchain-without-bitcoin applications and several blockchain projects acquire funding: $15m for Ethereum, $30m for Chain and $32m for Ripple Labs.</p><p> Google Trends: blockchain vs sidechains <br/> Google trends: &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; (blue) versus &ldquo;sidechain&rdquo; (red) &ndash; peaks at 9 times more search interest in &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; <br/> One 9th June, a company called Blockstream releases the first open-source code for &lsquo;sidechains&rsquo;, a technology that allows bitcoins to be moved from the main blockchain to higher level protocols (the sidechains), where they can be endowed with new functionality such as high-speed transactions, confidentiality, smart contracts and share issuance.</p><p> The technology gets negligible attention in the media.</p><p> Finally, despite all the skepticism and scrutiny, the bitcoin price finally breaks through the $300 resistance on 27th October.</p><p> The price rally is further boosted by publicity generated from media outlets claiming to have identified the man behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (supposedly an Australian academic and entrepreneur, a theory which now seems questionable).</p><h3> Sizing up 2016 <br/>  </h3><p> Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m expecting for the coming 12 months in bitcoin.</p><p> 1. The bitcoin network will scale</p><p> After many months of debate, I think 2016 will reveal a decision about how to scale bitcoin for the next few years.</p><p> There are a number of prudent and effective proposals on the table today, such as Pieter Wuille&rsquo;s &lsquo;Segregated Witness&rsquo;, and Adam Back&rsquo;s BIP248.</p><p> I expect one of the many proposed solutions to be implemented before the summer, to then later be supplemented by innovations such as pegged sidechains and the Lightning Network.</p><p> 2. Bitcoin will shine as a safe haven asset</p><p> I expect renewed volatility in global markets, and as a result I see liquidity problems popping up unexpectedly.</p><p> As a result, funds and investors will seek to hold assets with low counterparty risk. I think bitcoin will be one of these, more so than in previous years.</p><p> 3. Sidechains will be appreciated as major technical breakthrough</p><p> Similar to how bitcoin had to overcome accusations of being a Ponzi scheme in the early days, sidechains technology is now met with skepticism and mistrust.</p><p> As more operational sidechains come online and their utility and open-source nature become visible to the world, I expect perception to change for the better.</p><p> 4. Commodity giants will get involved with bitcoin mining</p><p> Faced with a bear market in commodity prices which implies a declining demand for electricity, some big primary sector companies will partner up with bitcoin mining companies to provide them with legal framework and physical infrastructure &ndash; allowing bitcoin transaction processing to take place in some of the most barren regions of the world.</p><p> 5. The bitcoin remittance network will further strengthen</p><p> Bitcoin exchanges integrating with each other internationally, deployment of more bitcoin ATMs and growth of bitcoin-friendly remittance platforms will allow for more and more people around the world to send money to their home country using bitcoin as a vehicle.</p><p> Should we see increased volatility in fiat currencies and the enforcement of exchange rate controls, then those too will serve as a catalyst for bitcoin remittance growth.</p><p> 6. The block reward halving will have a positive effect on the bitcoin price</p><p> In mid July 2016, the amount of new bitcoins awarded to bitcoin miners will drop from 3,600 BTC per day to 1,800 BTC per day.</p><p> With that, the annual increase in the bitcoin money supply will drop from 9.17% to 4.09%. Miners will have a diminished capacity to influence the markets (rumor has it that over the past two years they have engaged in quite a bit of short selling prior to pushing newly mined coins in the market).</p><p> I expect the block halving, all else being equal, to have a positive effect on the bitcoin price.</p><p> 7. Investors will be surprised</p><p> Every year I&rsquo;ve been involved in bitcoin, I&rsquo;ve been shocked and amazed.</p><p> In the bitcoin community, developers come with new hacks and solutions on a daily basis, competition is fierce and decidedly global, investors are eager yet often inexperienced and banks and governments are uneasy and fickle.</p><p> Bitcoin technology is only seven years old and bitcoin as a financial asset is only five. If I expect anything over the next 12 months, it is to be surprised.</p><p> It&rsquo;s for that reason as well that I only attach a 75% probability to the predictions above.</p><p> 2016 is shaping up to become an incredible year for bitcoin &ndash; maybe it will be the year when investors finally realize they cannot afford to not pay attention to this paradigm shift in money and finance.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 20:44:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 20:44:17.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_RF49qAO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/an-optimists-view-of-bitcoin-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8595\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 20:44:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 20:44:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"an-optimists-view-of-bitcoin-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8594\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4065\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-13-at-12.43.35-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"428\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452768300,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3919,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Best Practices to Manage and Achieve Your Goals in 2016","link":"5-best-practices-to-manage-and-achieve-your-goals-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We recently published our special edition newsletter, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/5-assignments-to-help-your-financial-advisory-firm-prepare-for-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   5 Assignments to Help Your Financial Advisory Firm Prepare for 2016  </u>  . </a> &rdquo; While each exercise is important to plot the course for the future of your practice, I want to help you realize your goals by ensuring you employ and execute the best practices of goal management.</p><p> This scenario is all too familiar: goals are set, put aside, and not managed. This is a critical mistake if your firm is to achieve success and reach each goal in the New Year. The execution of each goal requires considerable thought along with strategies to manage each goal for your firm and team.</p><p> To attain your goals it&rsquo;s important to have goal management practices in place. Without goal management, success is difficult to achieve.</p><p> <strong>   &ldquo;A Goal Is A Dream With A Deadline.&rdquo; &ndash; Napoleon Hill </strong></p><h3> What is Goal Management? <br/>  </h3><p> Effective goal management is an essential component for high-impact performance. Research tells us there is a direct link between effective goal management and exceptional organizational results.</p><p> Firms that adopt goal management best practices simply surpass those that don&rsquo;t. This is because team members know and understand what is expected of them, are focused on the right tasks at the right time, are aligned in helping to achieve company goals, and are more engaged.</p><p> <strong>  Team Engagement Levels Increase with Goal Management </strong></p><p> Your employees will become more engaged when:</p><li> They understand their individual goals</li><li> Goals are relevant to their specific role in the firm</li><li> Goals are meaningful and contribute to company success</li><li> Leaders support them in achieving their goals <br/>  </li><p> Research by  <u>  <a href=\"http://home.bersin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bersin by Deloitte  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/54/Watson-Wyatt-Worldwide.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Watson Wyatt  </a> </u> , the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aberdeen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Aberdeen Group  </a> </u> , the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.i4cp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Institute for Corporate Productivity  </a> </u>  (i4CP), the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.cebglobal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Corporate Executive Board  </a> </u> , and others identified best-practices to effectively manage goals and lead organizational performance. We&rsquo;ve compiled the highlights of the research and completed research of our own to help you focus on five best practices in goal management and how to implement each strategy in your firm.</p><h3> #1 &ndash; Set SMART Goals <br/>  </h3><p> There are a number of obstacles firms face related to goal setting. Many leaders and employees lack the skills required to set effective goals, establish low-quality goals, or even worse &ndash; set no goals. This results in the lack of clarity and alignment needed for high-performing firms.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aberdeen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Aberdeen Group  </a> </u>  found, when companies have a process in place to ensure managers and employees have agreed to performance goals, it has a positive impact on talent management related activities such as organizational goal achievement, succession planning, employee performance, and employee engagement.</p><p> By utilizing the SMART goal model &ndash; specific, measurable, achievable, relevant/realistic, and time based &ndash; leaders have an effective means to evaluate employee performance, measure employee and organizational progress, provide feedback and coaching, and promote team and employee development.</p><h3> Action Plan:</h3><li> Leaders and team members work together to establish individual goals</li><li> Ensure organizational goals are clearly communicated to the entire team</li><li> Explain how success will be measured</li><li> Discuss how individual goals support the team and firm to achieve goals <br/>  </li><p> Communication, clarity, and employee engagement are enhanced when you employ a collaborative goal setting approach.</p><h3> #2 &ndash; Align Individual Goals with Firm Goals <br/>  </h3><p> Sixty-four percent of employees don&rsquo;t understand their organization&rsquo;s goals according to the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.cebglobal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Corporate Executive Board  </a> </u> . Furthermore, many team members don&rsquo;t understand how their individual work contributes to the firm&rsquo;s success. The shortcoming can be attributed to the absence of alignment between individual employee goals and the firm&rsquo;s strategic goals.</p><p> A study by Workforce Intelligence Institute and Success Factors, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.successfactors.com/en_us/lp/articles/smart-hcm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How Smart HCM Drives Financial Performance  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; found that employees who don&rsquo;t understand the connection between their individual day-to-day efforts and the overall goals of the company feel confused in their role; resulting in low productivity levels and a lack of focus.</p><p> Individual goals that are directly tied to company goals provide a greater sense of teamwork and allow your firm to reach each goal faster. Goal alignment is one of the top strategies leveraged by high-performing teams.</p><p> When team members clearly understand and see how they make a significant contribution to the success of your firm, they will recognize and feel like an integral part of your organization. Generally, efficiency and productivity levels increase which lead to increased operating margins and profitability for your firm.</p><h3> Action Plan:</h3><li> Provide direct correlation to each employee between individual goals and your firm&rsquo;s high-level goals and sub-goals</li><li> Create shared accountability and responsibility between team members by &ldquo;cascading&rdquo; goals from one employee to another whenever possible</li><li> Communicate clear expectations during each stage until the goal is completed <br/>  </li><h3> #3 &ndash; Engage Employees  <br/>  </h3><p> Research tells us that leadership support, regular updates on goal progress, and recognition of goal achievement is a best practice that leads to higher levels of employee engagement.</p><p> To engage your team you need to set them up to be successful. It sounds obvious but is often an overlooked and neglected tactic as demands on everyone&rsquo;s time is drained. With a few simple steps you can help each team member commit to achieve each goal and provide high levels of employee engagement.</p><h3> Action Plan:</h3><p> Ensure you provide the following fundamentals to each employee for optimal engagement:</p><li> A good fit between their personality, skill set, and their individual goals</li><li> Clarity on how you expect them to complete each goal</li><li> Appropriate equipment and resources</li><li> Internal motivation</li><li> Training to help leverage strengths and minimize any deficiencies <br/>  </li><h3> #4 &ndash; Communicate Progress, Provide Feedback, and Measure What Matters <br/>  </h3><p> Truth be told, few things do more to stimulate employees than providing regular feedback surrounding their progress and performance.</p><p> To ensure this goal management practice doesn&rsquo;t get lost in the shuffle, schedule weekly one-on-one meetings with team members. By doing so, employees know that you care about their progress and not just the finished product. Also, use this time to review any performance issues, the addition of support or resources needed to complete the job, and any questions that arise.</p><p> Make certain to measure what matters. Many goals focus solely on financial metrics, however, most employees don&rsquo;t connect with metrics such as net cash flow, return on investment, or net profit.</p><p> Include metrics that help your team feel engaged: improving client satisfaction, reducing response time on client inquires, new client acquisition, or developing a new product or service. Anything that ties directly to the tasks and activities people perform on a daily basis will help them relate to the metrics being measured.</p><h3>  Action Plan:</h3><p> Leaders in your firm are responsible to:</p><li> Provide strategies to achieve each goal through team collaboration</li><li> Provide feedback and recognition</li><li> Review progress and status updates with each team member <br/>  </li><h3> #5 &ndash; Review and Modify Goals Frequently <br/>  </h3><p> Most firms miss the mark for goal review and modification. Fifty-four percent of companies believe goal setting is merely a once or twice per year activity.&sup1; With that belief, outcomes are less than favorable and result in: goals that are off-target or insignificant, organizational misalignment, disengaged employees, lack of accountability, and lower business results.</p><p> According to Bersin by Deloitte, &ldquo;Companies that have employees revise or review their goals quarterly or more frequently are 45% more likely to have above-average financial performance and 64% more likely to be effective at holding costs at or below level of competitors.&rdquo;</p><h3> Action Plan:</h3><li> Review and modify goals at all levels on a regular basis</li><li> Maintain ongoing discussion regarding goals</li><li> Create a culture where frequent goal conversations is routine <br/>  </li><p> A solid goal-management system is the key to achieving individual and team goals. Avoid falling short of reaching goals by implementing these five best practices. Each element is an important building block that you can put into your systems and processes right now. Each technique will move you one step forward in achieving something that could be undermining your overall performance and success.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-13 20:50:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-13 20:50:56.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_zHMvLFl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-best-practices-to-manage-and-achieve-your-goals-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8597\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-13 20:50:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-13 20:50:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-best-practices-to-manage-and-achieve-your-goals-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8596\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4066\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-13-at-12.50.30-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"447\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452974400,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3920,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Making a Difference Through Impact Investing","link":"making-a-difference-through-impact-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The growing appeal of  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_investing\" target=\"_blank\">   impact investing  </a> </u>  proves that social change and smart investment are not mutually exclusive.</h3><p> <br/> Impact investors seek to engender social and environmental change while still achieving a return on capital. Impact investments can target frontier, emerging, or developed markets. Unlike grants, the financial return can be reinvested, thereby allowing investors to maximize the positive impact of each dollar. <br/>   <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://monitorinstitute.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Monitor Institute  </a> </u>  divides impact investors into one of two categories: financial-first investors and impact-first investors. Financial-first investors expect a market or above-market rate of return. Their primary concern is a healthy return on investment. Impact-first investors focus more on the social or environmental benefits of the venture. Financial gains are secondary to the positive impact of their investment. These investors may be willing to accept a below-market rate of return, or simply a repayment of principal, if the investment has the potential for great social change. <br/>   <br/> The term &ldquo;impact investing&rdquo; was first coined in 2007 by the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rockefeller Foundation  </a> </u> . Born out of the microfinance and social enterprise movement, impact investing has grown into a multibillion dollar market over the past several years. J.P. Morgan and the Rockefeller Foundation&rsquo;s Global Impact Investing Network <a href=\"http://www.thegiin.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (  <u>   GIIN  </u>  ) </a>  expect the market to swell to $500 billion by the year 2020. Younger generations of investors, disillusioned by the global financial collapse, seem especially keen to direct private capital into socially responsible investment strategies. The long-term outlook for the impact investment market is exceptionally bright. <br/>   <br/> <img alt=\"bogw2\" src=\"https://www.blueoceanglobalwealth.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bogw2.jpg\"/> <br/> image credit:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.blueoceanglobaltech.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Blue Ocean Global Technology  </a> </u> <br/>   <br/> Blue Ocean Global Wealth CFO, Sameer Somal, and Blue Ocean Global Technology COO, Jaspal Aulakh, share smiles with students at FORE School of Management following their skill development education session in New Delhi, India. <br/>   <br/> To qualify as an impact investment, an investment must meet certain criteria (as outlined by GIIN). These particular qualities help to differentiate impact investing from other forms of investment</p><li> Intentionality: &ldquo;The intent of the investor to generate social and/or environmental impact through investments is an essential component of impact investing.&rdquo;</li><li> Investment with Return Expectations: &ldquo;Impact investments are expected to generate a financial return on capital and, at a minimum, a return of capital.&rdquo;</li><li> Range of Return Expectations and Asset Classes: &rdquo; Impact investments generate returns that range from below market (sometimes called concessionary) to risk-adjusted market rate.&rdquo;</li><li> Impact Measurement:&rdquo;A hallmark of impact investing is the commitment of the investor to measure and report the social and environmental performance and progress of underlying investments. Impact measurement helps ensure transparency and accountability, and is essential to informing the practice of impact investing and building the field.&rdquo;</li><p> Impact investing is sometimes viewed as a replacement or successor to philanthropic endeavors, yet the Monitor Institute and  <u>  <a href=\"http://acumen.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Acumen Fund  </a> </u>  prefer to think of it as a complementary practice&mdash;one more way of enacting positive change. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay and the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.omidyar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Omidyar Network  </a> </u> , believes in a collaborative approach to solving global problems: <br/>   <br/> &ldquo;One of the biggest things I&rsquo;ve learned in more than a decade of this work is that you really can make the world better in any sector&mdash;in nonprofits, in business, or in government. It&rsquo;s not a question of one sector&rsquo;s struggling against another, or of &lsquo;giving back&rsquo; versus &lsquo;taking away.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s old thinking. A true philanthropist will use every tool he can to make an impact.&rdquo;</p><p> <br/> <img alt=\"bogw3\" src=\"https://www.blueoceanglobalwealth.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bogw3.jpg\"/> <br/> image credit:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/india-rianta-capital-impact-investment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tech In Asia  </a> </u> <br/>   <br/> One of Omidyar Network&rsquo;s earliest investments was in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ethos-water.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ethos Water  </a> </u> , a bottled water company that uses a share of their proceeds to improve access to clean water in developing nations. Last year, private equity giant  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.baincapital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bain Capital  </a> </u>  joined the impact investment market by acquiring a 50% stake in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.toms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TOMS shoes  </a> </u> , an ethical footwear company that has donated over 10 million pairs of shoes to children in need. Through this sizable investment, TOMS plans to expand its social outreach. <br/>   <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gates Foundation  </a> </u>  is another organization at the forefront of the impact investment movement. To date, they have allocated over $1 billion dollars into program-related investments, through loan guarantees, low-interest loans, and equity investments in nonprofit organizations. Earlier this year, the foundation made a $52 million dollar investment in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.curevac.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CureVac  </a> </u> , a pioneering biotechnology firm focused on developing low-cost drugs and vaccines for controlling the spread of infectious disease in underdeveloped countries. <br/>   <br/> This influx of private capital may even inspire smaller businesses to adopt more socially-minded business models. We have yet to see the full reverberative effect of impacting investing.

But the immense and kaleidoscopic impact he left &ndash; on the cultural, musical, fashion and art scenes of our time &ndash; is irrefutable.</p><p> As we soak up our sorrows over the coming days by playing our favourite Bowie tracks (LOUDLY), I wanted to offer some of the inspiring lessons we learned from this superb human being:</p><h3> 1. Bowie didn&rsquo;t resist change; he welcomed it with open arms. </h3><p> <br/> Bowie reinvented himself constantly. His chameleon-like approach to every creative project he took on was breathtaking. It would have been so easy to sit back, rest on his laurels and cash in on each successful exploit. But his infamous move of killing off Ziggy Stardust at the height of his fame was just one demonstration of his willingness to reinvent himself and move onto the next creative adventure.</p><h3> 2. He was a poster child for collaboration. </h3><p> <br/> From Queen to Mick Jagger to Lou Reed and a multitude of other artists, Bowie saw the collaborative approach as a sure vehicle to creative greatness. Collaboration is the way of success in this century. Bowie was ahead of his time in realising its potential.</p><p> <strong>  Collaboration is the way of success this century. Bowie realised its potential. </strong></p><h3> 3. He was unabashedly, uncompromisingly himself. </h3><p> <br/> Bowie epitomised a life lived authentically. He marched to the beat of his own drum, regardless of the flack it sometimes elicited. He wrote and performed what he wanted, never bowing to the pressures to be a fake version of himself. Even his last creative exploit, Lazarus, a parting gift to his fans, was delivered on his terms.</p><h3> 4. He was curious and inquisitive. </h3><p> <br/> About life and himself. He used his pervasive feelings of fear, isolation, abandonment and anxiety as creative vehicles to explore the world around him.</p><p> So, thank you, David Bowie.</p><p> For the wonderful walk down memory lane to my teenage self.</p><p> For reminding us that We Can Be Heroes.</p><p> That we too can live an authentic, creative, flamboyant life if we choose to.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 16:47:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 16:47:24.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_gzSQSZl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/we-can-be-heroes-4-unabashed-lessons-from-david-bowie/\", \"post_id\": \"8600\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 16:47:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 16:47:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"we-can-be-heroes-4-unabashed-lessons-from-david-bowie\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8598\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4068\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Making-a-Difference-Through-Impact-Investing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"935\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452848400,"author_id":467,"chart_url":""}

How to Prepare Now","link":"could-your-finances-survive-a-natural-disaster-how-to-prepare-now","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The start of a New Year is the time to make resolutions to get organized and generally do things better. This year the weather patterns are unusual due to the influence of El Ni&ntilde;o. Some parts of the country are bracing for above-normal temperatures, while others are at higher risk for ice storms. What would you do if the weather took a turn for the worse? Could your finances survive a natural disaster?</p><p> No one knows when an emergency will occur that will result in an interruption to your normal routine. Hopefully this type of situation will never happen in your area, but you should take news reports as an incentive to ensure that you and your family are prepare in case a similar event occurs near you.</p><h3> <strong>  How to Help your Finances Survive a Natural Disaster </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here are some steps you can take to keep your home and possessions safe and secure.</p><h3> 1. Store your important financial papers off site.</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t keep your bank statements, investment information, insurance policies, powers of attorney and your will at home. If your home is damaged or destroyed, you will lose access to this important information. Rent a safety deposit box at your bank for a nominal cost instead and make sure these papers are kept in a secure location.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a good idea to have digital records as a back up to the paper versions. You can scan your documents and then store them as electronic files to use when paper records are not accessible.</p><h3> 2. Make a point of documenting your home&rsquo;s contents.</h3><p> <br/> Can you describe the items in your home? Do you remember the make and model of each one? Would you be able to provide accurate information during a time of extreme stress? It would be very challenging to remember all the details at a time like that.</p><p> If you are going to make a claim against your homeowners&rsquo; insurance policy following a natural disaster to replace your contents, you will need to describe your loss accurately. You can start by recording the valuables in your home, especially the big ticket items. Make note of the details and place the information in your safety deposit box and/or videotape of all your possessions.</p><h3> 3. Review your insurance coverage with your financial advisor.</h3><p> <br/> You will want to make sure you have the right coverage in place before a natural disaster strikes. Be sure to ask whether your property insurance policy covers you for specific events like a flood (Vancouver residents need to be mindful as they say the next big earthquake is just around the corner). You will also want to make sure your policy provides enough coverage for any big ticket items you own, such as jewelry, art, or cameras.</p><p> You will also want to ensure you have enough life insurance and disability coverage in place. No one wants to think about dying or possibly becoming disabled but planning for these things are part of making sure you are prepared for a natural disaster. It&rsquo;s a good idea to review your personal insurance regularly and to modify your coverage when needed.</p><h3> 4. Make sure your will and power of attorney are up to date.</h3><p> <br/> These documents need to be updated from time to time as circumstances in your life change. Your family may have grown or a beneficiary may have passed away since you drafted your original will. Your assets may have changed, and you will want to ensure that these documents reflect your current estate.</p><h3> 5. Have easily accessible emergency funds.</h3><p> <br/> You will want to make sure you can access some cash in an emergency. You may not be able to use your credit or debit card right away if a natural disaster occurs. It&rsquo;s a good idea to have an emergency stash somewhere safe so you will have a backup in case you have to leave your home in a hurry.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 17:39:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 17:39:39.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_fSQHMj9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/could-your-finances-survive-a-natural-disaster-how-to-prepare-now/\", \"post_id\": \"8601\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 17:39:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 17:39:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"could-your-finances-survive-a-natural-disaster-how-to-prepare-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8598\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4069\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Making-a-Difference-Through-Impact-Investing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"422\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452956400,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3923,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Behavioral Economics: The Human Side of Investing","link":"behavioral-economics-the-human-side-of-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vanguard_FA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Richard Thaler  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Vanguard  </u> </a></p><p> What if Adam Smith had collaborated with Sigmund Freud? They might have developed the academic discipline that is known today as behavioral economics. Instead, it fell to Richard Thaler and other researchers to launch the discipline, which uses insights from psychology to explain our economic decisions.</p><p> Thaler teaches behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and has written widely on the subject. His latest book, Misbehaving1, intelligently and humorously describes his adventures in helping to develop a new and, in the eyes of some colleagues, subversive branch of economic research. He also explains how applying psychology to economics can help people make better financial decisions.</p><p> We recently interviewed Thaler about the beginnings of behavioral economics and how investors might recognize and try to correct their own financial misbehavior.</p><h3> Your new book chronicles your challenge to the assumption that, in general, we make rational economic decisions. When did you first realize that this assumption might be wrong?</h3><p> <br/> I began to have economically deviant thoughts in graduate school. The economic agents I was studying in my textbooks (whom I like to call Econs) did not resemble anyone I had ever met. These creatures in economic models were as smart as the smartest economists, had no emotions or self-control problems, and were completely selfish.</p><p> Most people I knew had trouble balancing their checkbooks, did stupid things when they got angry, ate too much, and saved too little, but were much nicer than economists gave them credit for. For example, real people, but not Econs, leave tips in restaurants, even if they never intend to go back. No Econ would do such a thing.</p><p> Behavioral coaching: Practical tools for you and your clients</p><p> <a href=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/researchcommentary/article/IWE_BehaviorCoachingTools\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Explore how you can help clients maintain perspective and avoid ill-advised impulses. </a>  Materials include client-approved print pieces, articles, and videos.</p><h3> Which of our behavioral biases do the most damage to our financial well-being?</h3><p> <br/> There are many failings that get us into trouble financially, as I describe inMisbehaving, so let me focus on just two.</p><p> The first is loss aversion. Losses have about twice the emotional impact of an equivalent gain. Fear of losses (and a tendency toward short-term thinking&mdash;I'm sneaking in a third one here) can inhibit appropriate risk-taking.</p><p> For example, investing in the stock market has historically provided much higher returns than investing in bonds or savings accounts, but stock prices fluctuate more, producing a greater risk of losses. Loss aversion can prevent investors from taking advantage of the long-term opportunities in stocks.</p><p> The second bias that causes a lot of trouble is overconfidence. Most people think they are above-average investors, and as a result, they trade too much and diversify too little. Overconfidence can also lead people to invest during what appears to be a bubble, thinking they will just get out faster than others. Research shows that the more individuals trade, the lower their returns. Not surprisingly, men suffer from this problem more than women.</p><p> This is one of the many reasons why it would be better if we had more women as portfolio managers.</p><h3> Simply being aware of our biases isn't always enough to combat them. We know we'll suffer tonight for the deep-fried pepperoni pizza we eat today, but we do it anyway. Why?</h3><p> <br/> Most of us know, at some level, that we suffer from self-control problems, but we underestimate their extent. We think we can stop at the bar for just one beer before going to bed but end up having two or three. We think we can save simply by cutting back on unnecessary expenditures, but then we run up credit card debt.</p><h3> So how can we combat these self-destructive biases?</h3><p> <br/> The most successful way of dealing with self-control problems is by committing ourselves in advance. Say no to the offer to have just one drink at the bar at the end of the evening. Put the alarm clock on the other side of the room to make sure you don't just hit the snooze button.</p><p> In financial matters, the only way most (nonwealthy) people successfully save for retirement is by having money taken out of their paychecks automatically and deposited into a retirement savings plan like a 401(k).</p><p> I always recommend that people saving for retirement&mdash;especially those who are young enough to have a long horizon over which to invest&mdash;should tilt their portfolios heavily toward a globally diversified portfolio of stocks, and then scrupulously avoid reading financial news articles or, even worse, watching financial news networks. Paying attention day-to-day is damaging to one's financial and emotional well-being.</p><p> In my parents' generation, another successful way to save was to pay off the mortgage; that was the first financial goal of most families, and a windfall was often used to pay it down. As a result, until about 1980, most people over 60 had little or no mortgage debt.</p><p> But the ease of refinancing and the long-term decline in interest rates have eroded this useful social norm. I recommend that anyone over 45 who's getting a mortgage should choose a 15-year term and then just pay it off. Do it today! Interest rates are low.</p><h3> If we can maintain Spock-like rationality, is it possible for us to profit from the biases that afflict our fellow investors?</h3><p> <br/> I think it is possible to earn superior rates of return by taking advantage of the biases displayed by other investors, but it is not easy to do so. I am a principal in an asset management firm that uses this approach and has been successful, but my advice is, \"Don't try this at home.\"</p>1 Richard H. Thaler, 2015.

Let&rsquo;s face it, money is a limited resource &mdash; you can&rsquo;t go in the backyard and pull money off the money tree.</h3>So, when you look at the cost of living, of educating children, of saving for retirement, a lot of people end up without a lot of disposable income. But I think part of the problem is that people are thinking about their money all wrong.My goal as a planner is to help my clients optimize their financial well-being. The biggest problem people face when planning for the future is they make their money decisions one at a time, independent of every other money decision. A person might increase their contributions to their 401(k) plan at work, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily consider the impact of that decision on their mortgage, other investments, insurance policies, or estate. The key is to understand how each piece might be enhanced by coordinating it with the other components of your financial life, and that is an approach that can help free up money to achieve financial well-being. Cash value life insurance can be an important part of that strategy.I work with people on their financial plans all the time, and I can tell you that there are a number of different strategies that could free up potential funding sources for life insurance you may be overlooking. I&rsquo;d like to share five of these strategies with you today.<h3> 1. Stop Overfunding Your 401(k)</h3>The mainstream media has led a lot of people to believe the best thing a person could ever do is maximize their 401(k) contributions. Maybe&hellip;but maybe not. Every financial decision has advantages and disadvantages to it. A 401(k) offers some good advantages &ndash; there might be a company matching contribution, it reduces your immediate taxable income, and it is a form of forced savings. Unfortunately, there are also significant disadvantages to a 401(k) plan. It locks up your money until you are 59 &frac12;, and you are taxed on the withdrawals at the prevailing tax rate at the time of withdrawal.The single biggest advantage to a 401(k) is the company match. You should be contributing enough to take advantage of this free money, but everything over and above what is required to get the company match might mean you are overfunding your 401(k).Instead, use that excess to fund whole life insurance. Because there&rsquo;s a tax-advantaged cash value that grows on a guaranteed basis with dividends on top of it, if you compare the after-tax value of the 401(k) at retirement with the cash value of the insurance, you might actually end up with more money in the life insurance. Using the same amount of cash flow, we&rsquo;ve taken advantage of the company match, provided protection during those accumulation years, and we&rsquo;re providing tax-advantaged cash for use at retirement&ndash;or at any time actually.<h3> 2. Free Up Tour \"Reinvested Dividends\"</h3>If you have investments outside of your 401(k) or other qualified retirement accounts, you are most likely automatically reinvesting any dividends you receive from your mutual funds and stocks. That is a popular investment strategy, but it can sometimes work against you. We&rsquo;ve all been taught the notion that you want to buy low and sell high, but reinvesting dividends locks you into buying more of a stock or mutual fund no matter what the price is, whether the market is up or down. There&rsquo;s no control over that money decision, and it may not always pay off.Rather than reinvesting the dividends, what if we use them to fund life insurance? We&rsquo;re using one asset to create another; one with both a death benefit and a cash value. It adds much better protection, not only from a death benefit standpoint. If you have a disability waiver, your policy will continue to be funded if you become disabled. Also, in many states, the cash value is fully protected from lawsuits and creditors, unlike the investment account.<h3> 3. Use Your Tax Refund. or Better Yet, Change Your Withholding</h3>Most people that I meet get a Federal income tax refund. Often, they look at their tax refund as a form of forced savings. The reality is they&rsquo;ve essentially given the government an interest-free loan for the year. If you are getting a tax refund, it may make sense to adjust your withholding so you have more take-home pay. This is another potential source of funding for life insurance which, if structured properly, will provide a decent rate of return. It&rsquo;s a much better use of the money than giving it to the government as an interest-free loan.<h3> 4. Use Money Sitting in Your Bank Account, Earning Little to Nothing in Interest</h3>Since the stock market crash of 2008, people have gotten a little gun-shy of the market. You see a lot of people stuffing money into savings and money market accounts. These are safe, but they offer a very low rate of return, maybe 0.0025 percent. Cash value life insurance offers a guaranteed minimum return on whole life of 3.5 percent. The money that is currently sitting in your bank, earning effectively nothing, could be repositioned to achieve a better result.That said, I am an avid believer in the idea that people should have an amount equal to 50 percent of their income &ldquo;in the bank.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m putting &ldquo;in the bank&rdquo; in quotes because the idea is to have the money in a safe and easily accessible location. It need not be a bank.If someone is well on their way to having that 50 percent of their income in the bank, then it could potentially be a very appropriate funding source. By the way, the cash value of a whole life insurance can act as part of that 50 percent savings. The money needs to be safe, not risk-based, and easily accessible. That sounds like life insurance to me.In my own personal situation, I&rsquo;ve got money in a money market account, but my real emergency fund is the cash value of my life insurance policies, which is in excess of 50 percent of my income. All this while I&rsquo;m getting a competitive rate of return. But, again, this strategy might not be right for everyone.<h3> 5. Use Debt Wisely</h3>Our ultimate objective is to put someone in a better position financially on a holistic basis than where they are today. As part of that, we need to look at how people are using debt. There&rsquo;s good debt, and there&rsquo;s bad debt. Good debt is the type you can deduct on your taxes, like your mortgage or home equity lines; good debt gives you leverage to acquire assets. Bad debt is pretty much everything else. Unfortunately, Americans have gotten themselves into a position where a high percentage of their cash flow goes to debt service. In the planning work that we do, we want our clients to be debt-free. Few people have the ability to do that right away, so if people can&rsquo;t be debt-free, our number one objective is to turn bad debt into good debt.If a person has equity in their home, there&rsquo;s really no return on that equity. You can&rsquo;t pull a brick out of your house, go down to the supermarket and buy groceries with it. One strategy is to convert some of your non-deductible debt into deductible debt just by refinancing, leveraging some of the equity to pay off some of the bad debt. This would create a tax deduction that you did not have before, and you might create more cash flow for yourself.By restructuring your debt, you can free up cash flow which could, in turn, be used to fund insurance or accomplish other financial goals. Note: you&rsquo;re not borrowing money to fund insurance. You&rsquo;re using debt more wisely and using the improved cash flow to fund the insurance.The key to all these approaches is to take a holistic view of someone&rsquo;s financial situation and understand the role that life insurance can play in producing a significantly better result. That allows people to reposition the pieces and use existing cash flows in a way that enables them to achieve their goals.I hope I&rsquo;ve given you some food for thought. Of course, everyone&rsquo;s life and financial situation is unique. You should talk with your financial advisor to determine if these or other strategies might work for you.If you are interested in learning more details on any of what I&rsquo;ve discussed, I encourage you to get a copy of my book, &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Playing-Wealth-Building-Game-Discovering/dp/1507621558\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Playing the Wealth Building Game </a></u>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; book, but it will give you some additional insight on different ways to think about money.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 19:13:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 19:13:15.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_WPKPQne.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-secrets-to-funding-life-insurance/\", \"post_id\": \"8604\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 19:13:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 19:13:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-secrets-to-funding-life-insurance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8602\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4071\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Behavioral-Economics-The-Human-Side-of-Investing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"391\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452942000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3925,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"This Year Stop Being Your Own Worst Enemy!","link":"this-year-stop-being-your-own-worst-enemy","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I want to ask you a question. What is the number one thing holding you back from accomplishing more this year? What one thing, if tackled, would produce great results?</h3><p> <br/> You guessed it, get out of your own way! I always use the example of a person walking towards a mirror, and saying&rdquo; why doesn&rsquo;t that person get out of my way?&rdquo; The hardest thing to understand is yourself. The hardest item to work on to improve your business, is you. In 2016, what is the number one thing that you want to accomplish? Is it getting more ideal clients, upgrading existing clients, service and revenues, or managing capacity and demands of running a busy advisory practice? The only thing that is holding you back, is YOU!</p><h3> What keeps you up at night?</h3><p> <br/> To have a better year, you need a better plan. You need to work on that plan, implement the plan and envision the results. Are you blinded by fear inside? What if all of this really happens? I know that when I put my goals and plans to paper this year, I found myself being fearful of accomplishing what is possible. I understand, I know that I am holding myself back for several reasons or excuses, including fear. However, this is not about me, this is about you. At least, I spent 10 hours on my plan for the year and creating one three and five year plans. Now I have a plan that I am not fearful of. Are you going to operate this year without a plan? A majority of financial advisors do. Who is going to go over your plan with you, and giving you feedback to keep you on track? As business owners, we can create a plan, but who holds us accountable, you do. The same reason that holds you back, is the same person who holds you accountable. Consider having someone else go over your plans with you and hold you accountable, so you get rid of the fear.</p><h3> What planning do I need to do?</h3><p> <br/> There are a million resources available on goals and planning out there. Here are key practice management strategies when it comes to planning. Have a strategic business plan. This is your long term 3-5 year plan for your business. According to Business Health Pty Ltd in Australia, only 41% of Australian practices have a strategic plan, and the ones that do have a 194% profit impact ( <u>  BusinessHealth.com.au December 2015 Newsletter </u> ) I would encourage you to read their newsletter after this one to help you with your planning. Next you need your one year plan and it would include a sales and marketing plan or marketing calendar. I created a content calendar for all of my blog posts, videos, webinars and workshops for the calendar year and put my year down to 2000 hours, which is approximately 45 weeks at 45 hours per week. Now tell me how you&rsquo;re going to effectively service and communicate to 500 plus clients in 2000 hours per year? Which client is going to leave you this year? The one that has minimal communication and receives minimal value for the fee they pay each year. Next year when CRM2 in Canada becomes in full effect, it will be even easier to identify clients who will leave or even worse, not give you any more business.</p><h3> Succession planning</h3><p> <br/> According to Business Health Pty. Ltd of Australia, only 39% of Australian practices have a succession plan and the ones that do earn 69% more than practices without a documented succession plan. I understand why it is not a top priority, again the word fear of death is near to all of us. Over the holidays I spent time documenting my succession plan and organized it in a binder. I told my family, if something ever happens to me, go to the black binder, it is all there. Do you have binders for your top clients to organize their estate and documents? Or do you have one yourself? Do yours first and you will want to help others get it done.</p><h3> Review last year</h3><p> <br/> One exercise I do every January is look at all the meetings and appointments I had the previous year, every single one and write down what worked and what did not work. Then I reason why certain things worked and try to eliminate activities and actions that did not work. I look at my coaching clients, speaking clients and training clients and determine two things, add to or eliminate. It helps me plan my time for the year and also my revenue and growth opportunities.</p><h3> Start with a plan or get help</h3><p> <br/> We know that advisors who have a coach or belong to a coaching program or study group earn 108% more than advisors who do not get help according to the same research from Business Health Pty Ltd. We are talking about an external advisor who you meet with at least quarterly to hold you accountable for keeping you on track to reach your goals. I meet for a half day each quarter with my advisor to go over my plans and goals and report how my progress is doing. He is a business coach named Rick Unruh who I work with to help me accomplish more, get rid of fear and hold me accountable. Who do you work with? If you don&rsquo;t have someone, put it as the first goal on your list. Make 2016 a great year, get rid of the fear and have a plan on paper. If you need help reach out to someone. As legendary ski movie maker Warren Miller said&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t do it this year, you will be one year older when you do&rdquo;.</p> <p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 19:17:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 19:17:17.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_LmLRP6y.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-year-stop-being-your-own-worst-enemy/\", \"post_id\": \"8606\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 19:17:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 19:17:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-year-stop-being-your-own-worst-enemy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8605\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4072\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/This-Year-Stop-Being-Your-Own-Worst-Enemy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"496\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452860100,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3926,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"13 Divine Properties Of Water","link":"13-divine-properties-of-water","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Many of us are waiting for that miracle, you know, the big one&mdash;the one that will confirm our belief in something larger than ourselves. Yet, we are surrounded by things that actually are pretty miraculous; some even defying the common laws of science as we know them. One of those things is water. I can even go out on a limb and say that this remarkable substance known as water has many of the characteristics that some would equate to God-like. Although, I don&rsquo;t take it that far, I believe this characterization is an interesting philosophical consideration. That said, here are 13 properties of water that are quite divine.</p><p> <strong>  1. Water is the most abundant substance on earth &ndash; covering 70% of planet </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s why the chances of a satellite plummeting into land is low.</p><p> <strong>  2. Humans are composed of 60 &ndash; 70% water </strong></p><p> Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Most medical calculations and dosing is based on this fact.</p><p> <strong>  3. Water dissolves more substances than any other liquid  </strong></p><p> Just look at the Grand Canyon. Over time, water can dissolve great mountains, shorelines, even metal</p><p> <strong>  4. The earth is a closed system, similar to a terrarium, meaning that it rarely loses or gains extra matter. The same water that existed on the earth millions of years ago is still present today </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s right, the water you are drinking today is the same as that sipped by Dino the Dinosaur or a caveman near you!</p><p> <strong>  5. A person can live about a month without food, but only about a week without water </strong></p><p> Water is the most vital solution for life&mdash;the function of all our vital organs.</p><p> <strong>  6. Water is the only substance that is found naturally on earth in three forms: liquid, gas, solid </strong></p><p> There are a few other substances that can occur in these states, but none exist naturally, at the same time, right now, on earth. They must be manipulated in some way. Not water.</p><p> <strong>  7. Water has an extremely high dielectric strength compared to other liquids </strong></p><p> This gives water the ability that other liquids don&rsquo;t possess, to dissolve compounds. Dielectric strength is the ability of a material to withstand an electric field without breaking down.</p><p> <strong>  8. Water also has the ability to pass through cell membranes and climb great heights in plants and trees through osmosis and capillary force </strong></p><p> Osmotic pressure and capillary action enable water to climb hundreds of feet to the tops of the highest trees. Through osmosis, marine creatures can absorb fresh water in an increasing salt-water environment.  And then, the increase in cell pressure causes the osmosis to reverse itself and preserve the life of the creature. The same mysterious action takes place on a micro-scale within the bodies of all living beings.</p><p> <strong>  9. Sound travels through sea water about 4.5 times as fast as it travels through air </strong></p><p> The speed of sound in dry air at 20 &deg;C, is 1,236 km/hr (768 mph); in water, 5342 km/hr (3320 mph).</p><p> <strong>  10. Light sends electromagnetic waves through water, causing many crystalline patterns and photosynthesis </strong></p><p> Passing water through a magnetic field reorients water hardness, eliminating scaling in pipes and cooking utensils. Thoughts change the crystalline patterns of water that sends electronic waves through human and animal bodies. Good thoughts may produce good results like health and happiness and bad thoughts produce bad results, such as poor health. The majority of this work was done by Masaru Emoto. Although some have questioned the science behind his work, no one has been able to disprove it either.</p><p> <strong>  11. Water holds a deep significance in some religious scripture </strong></p><p> Christianity requires immersion in water, through Baptism, to become one with God. From the Creation story in Genesis, to Noah and the great flood, to the parting of the Red Sea, to Jonah and the whale&mdash;the great power of water is indisputable.</p><p> <strong>  12. All life arose from water, billions of years ago </strong></p><p> No matter what theory about the beginnings of life here on earth, they all have one element in common&mdash;water. From the Creation story to the Primordial Soup theory, water is present prior to life.</p><p> <strong>  13. Our lives begin in water </strong></p><p> In the womb, amniotic water serves to protect the fetus. In many ways, a fetus arises from the water onto the earth, symbolic of billions of years of evolution.</p><p> ###</p><p> There you have it. You be the judge. Whether you&rsquo;d like to think of water as the God you have been seeking or just one part of the majesty of Creation, it matters not. Truth be told, it is a substance that without it, life as we know it and often take for granted, could never exist. So, next time you place a glass of water to your lips, take a moment to ponder this (not so little) miracle you are about to ingest. </p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 19:25:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 19:25:26.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_sUUACSH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/13-divine-properties-of-water/\", \"post_id\": \"8608\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 19:25:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 19:25:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"13-divine-properties-of-water\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8607\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4073\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/13-Divine-Properties-of-Water.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1106\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452880800,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3927,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Difference Between Core Competencies and Values","link":"the-difference-between-core-competencies-and-values","source_link":null,"content":"<p>One of the questions our consultants are frequently asked is, &ldquo;Is there a difference between organizational values and core competencies, or do they perform the same function?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a good question, because these two elements are closely related. But to clearly define and support your organizational culture, it&rsquo;s important to have both in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let&rsquo;s start by defining some key terms:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.talentguard.com/whats-the-difference-between-skills-and-competencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Competencies identify the observable behaviors </a> that successful performers demonstrate on the job. Those behaviors are the result of various abilities, skills, knowledge, motivations, and traits an employee may possess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core competencies are a specific type of competency. They identify the key values and strengths shared by everyone in the organization, regardless of the job they perform. Supporting those shared core competencies enable an organization to differentiate itself in a competitive marketplace and define the behaviors that support those differentiators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Values identify the beliefs or ideals shared by everyone in the organization. Whether they are organizational or personal, our values define the things we believe are important, meaningful, and right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While competencies and values have significant areas of overlap, there&rsquo;s a key difference between them:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Values are intangible. They are based on feelings, perceptions, preferences, and priorities&mdash;an internal code that influences how we experience and interpret the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competencies are tangible. They define on-the-job behaviors that can be objectively observed and measured by the people around us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This tangible element is very important. Too often, organizational values remain at the conceptual level and fail to be embodied, because we don&rsquo;t have a way to objectively define what those values mean at an operational level. Although we may all agree that &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; is a core value and a competitive advantage, if we can&rsquo;t define what effective customer service looks like at every level of the organization, it becomes a meaningless buzzword instead of a blueprint to guide our performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>HRSG competency consultant Christine Lamothe explains it this way:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Values are what are important to the organization, and competencies are the tools that support that. Maybe a continuous learning environment is critical for the organization. Maybe it&rsquo;s client satisfaction or quality of service. Whatever it is, you would look at core competencies to support that. It&rsquo;s a marriage of the &lsquo;what&rsquo; and the &lsquo;how.&rsquo; How do your employees demonstrate those values day to day?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By providing that tangible element, core competencies enable organizations to translate their values into day-to-day workplace behaviors that can be identified, measured, supported, and developed using specific HR tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU), an HRSG client, had a strong set of political and ethical values that weren&rsquo;t connecting with their hiring and performance-management processes. They went through the process of selecting core competencies that aligned with those values so that they could bring clarity and consistency to their HR practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we look at potential candidates, we are looking at the six core competencies and determining whether these people fit the organization and fit our values,&rdquo; explains Nazlin Mohamed, OPSEU&rsquo;s Supervisor of Employee Relations. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s helped us to determine the right kind of people and communicate with our staff in terms of what&rsquo;s expected.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPSEU is leveraging their core competencies throughout the talent management lifecycle, starting with the development of a set of interview questions that enables them to identify candidates whose values are the right fit.

We know it so well; we use it way too much during the day, like when we post pictures of our food, or recording our pet cats doing really goofy things. There was even a time, literally, when anyone who was anyone was taking a shower of ice down their backs for charity. It may seem like the internet is turning into mindless entertainment. But, to the business owner, it&rsquo;s anything but mindless. It is turning business, sales, profits, and customer service on its ear.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s one example. I ordered a pair of shoes on the internet. They came within a few days, exactly as I ordered them. I wore them, but they hurt. I went online, filled out a refund slip, printed out a return label, wrapped the shoes in the box, and the bag it was shipped in, dropped it off at the local UPS drop center, and within one day, my payment was back in my account. What does that mean for our brick and mortar shoe stores who will haggle you if you&rsquo;ve actually worn the shoes outside.</p><p> We all understand how the internet has impacted business, but I think we still need to pay more attention to some seemingly obvious requirements. The latest example is that political TV ads are proving less effective than a simple 140-character line in twitter.</p><p> While we think we know and understand the internet, I don&rsquo;t know if we truly understand how pervasive it is in our society:</p><li> <strong>  Amazon, the elephant in room, had 20% of ecommerce sales during Christmas (2015) and almost $100 billion in total volume. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Our mobile device is the way we now do research, shop, and compare prices. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The American consumer spends almost 3 hours per day on their mobile device, representing over 50 % of internet activity. Shopping, searching, and comparing are critical aspects of any marketing campaign. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Consider the new internet sharing networks; it&rsquo;s estimated that sharing networks, led by Airbnb and Uber, will reach $350 billion dollars by 2025. However, whole industries like travel, business services, job placement, product sales (Amazon), real estate, etc., are being forced to transform as these new tools emerge. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Internet funding sites, like Crowdfunding and Angel Investors, are dramatically impacting small business financing. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Recognizing the importance of the internet, AND USING IT, is a must for any business owner. Specifically:</p><li> You need to have constant attention and professional help in both updating and maximizing your internet potential. Every month, it seems, the internet gets more savvy, and what you learned is new now. Like:</li><li> Are you integrating E-mail blasts with other tools like web-site links and social media postings?</li><li> Are you including graphics, videos, and other presentation tools in your content?</li><li> Are you developing or hiring the proper professional support to execute programs (a professional can tell you the best time and way to capture your target audience)?</li><li> Are you developing techniques to encourage feedback and communication with customers?</li><li> On the internet, you have flexibility to see instant results and then adapt. However, you must pay attention to the details and continue to measure and test (we had a client who was having low sales results; we simply modified shipping charges, initiated more promotions, and sent newsletters, and their business tripled). <br/>  </li><p> A challenge of the internet is that it must be an integrated effort, rather than a series of separate activities. Goals, home page, links, SEO, strategy, social media, communication with customers, customer service, and pricing &ndash; all this must all be considered together. <br/> The internet provides numerous operational tools to make businesses more productive and profitable. Google analytics, CRM (customer relationship management) systems, targeting, and e-mail systems are among the most used tools.</p><p> <strong>  Conclusion </strong></p><p> <strong>  We often give lip service to the importance of the internet, and we think that it may be becoming a frivolous pastime, but don&rsquo;t turn your back on it. Why focus on declining practices, such as brick and mortar retail stores or traditional advertising, when you can participate in a new, evolving, strategy with almost unlimited potential!! </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 21:03:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 21:03:58.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_s8PYyjY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-internet-dont-turn-your-back-on-this-amazing-sales-and-marketing-tool/\", \"post_id\": \"8612\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 21:03:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 21:03:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-internet-dont-turn-your-back-on-this-amazing-sales-and-marketing-tool\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8611\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4075\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Internet-\\u2013-Don\\u2019t-Turn-Your-Back-on-this-Amazing-Sales-and-Marketing-Tool.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"694\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452873600,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

One of the biggest worry on the minds of many who are either retired or who are approaching retirement is that of outliving their income before they run out of time.</p><p> Yet today, there is also another fear that many seniors have &ndash; one that may not be quite as openly discussed, but nevertheless, it still ranks among the top on the list. This is the fear of becoming a burden on their children should they become too old or too frail to be able to care for themselves.</p><h3> The Consequences of &ldquo;Unassisted Living&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> According to a recent report by UBS Investor Watch titled &ldquo;Unassisted Living,&rdquo; even though many say that they fear being a burden on their children during old age, they prefer not to seek their assistance. In fact, based on the report, only 39% of even wealthy investors have talked with their children regarding who will take care of them &ndash; preferring to remain in their own homes and to rely either on a spouse or on a home health aide should assistance be needed.1</p><p> Unfortunately, though, while many individuals have high hopes of remaining in their own homes as they age, very few have actually developed a plan for doing so &ndash; and even fewer have saved for it.2</p><p> One reason for this could be that many individuals don&rsquo;t really know just how expensive long-term care can be. Others may just simply not want their loved ones to worry about them as they age.</p><h3> The Cost Impact of a Long-Term Care Need</h3><p> <br/> A big part of the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/long-term-care-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   long term care planning  </a> </u>  process begins with knowing what you could be up against in terms of the true cost. This includes the price tag financially, as well as physically and emotionally.</p><p> Based on Genworth&rsquo;s 2014 Cost of Care Survey, the daily price tag for a private room in a skilled nursing home facility in 2014 was $240 &ndash; which equates to more than $87,000 annually. And, while home health care workers average roughly $20 per hour3, when you add up the cost of someone coming in for 20 or more hours per week &ndash; sometimes more &ndash; this too can add up to a substantial expense.</p><p> But the costs can add up in more ways than just dollar signs. Often, in order to save from a financial perspective, family members or other loved ones will step in and provide informal care to someone who needs it. This, however, can create a strain &ndash; especially as the individual&rsquo;s needs become more demanding.</p><h3> Overcoming the Cost By Creating a Plan</h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways to overcome the cost of long-term care is to have a plan in that is already place. This can help from a financial perspective &ndash; and it can also help in alleviating the worry about becoming a burden to one&rsquo;s children or other loved ones. Knowing ahead of time how care will be taken care of can do wonders for the entire family, providing a comfort level for all who are involved.</p><p> If you&rsquo;d like to see the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/life-insurance-buyers-guide/types-of-life-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   types of plans  </a> </u>  that are available to you and your family, contact us.

{"original_id":3930,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Demystifying Diversification - Three Characteristics of a Diversified Portfolio","link":"demystifying-diversification-three-characteristics-of-a-diversified-portfolio","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The wide world of finance is abundant with terms that sound more complex than they really are. Diversification usually tops that list. Demystifying diversification is important for reasons that relate to mitigating risk. No investor wants a loss in their portfolio but like it or not, market fluctuations are an inevitable part of investing and cause anxiety. Therefore, it is important to have a strategy to deal with it. You&rsquo;ve heard the expression, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p><p> Diversification comes from the Latin  diversus , meaning turned in different ways. If you have diversified something, you have made its parts dissimilar from each other.</p><p> The theory behind diversification does not only happen in finance. Let&rsquo;s take retail as an example. Designers like Tory Burch&reg; diversify their product lines to include not only handbags, but every must-have you can dream up like clothing, shoes, watches, sunglasses, perfume and cosmetics. Can you just imagine walking into your favorite store and finding only one style, color, and size of shoe? That would be ridiculous. So why do it with investments?</p><p> How about this. Do you think sales on wool coats affect sales on flip flops during a winter freeze? Probably not. In this instance the demand for outerwear and shoes are not correlated, meaning a spike in sales of wool coats has no effect on flip flops, neither negatively or positively. That&rsquo;s good news for the company and protects owners and shareholders in choppy sales cycles &ndash; keep that in the back of your mind as we return to the concept of diversification in investing.  </p><p> So what is it? Diversification is a risk management technique that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source: Investopedia  </a> </u> . Sounds pretty self-explanatory. You&rsquo;ll own some stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, real estate, commodities, etc. If something bad happens in one type of investment you may not necessarily lose your shirt and everything you own. So why all of the confusion? Because each investment professional does it a little differently. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking? Is there one universal generic rule that is applicable to all portfolios? Not really. As Investment Reporter John Heinzl points out: &ldquo;The academics disagree over how many separate stocks are required to secure the benefits of diversification, but most professionally managed equity portfolios have at least 30 or so individual securities in them,&rdquo; U.S. fund manager Daniel Peris wrote in his 2011 book, The Strategic Dividend Investor.</p><p> So what about the demystifying part? I&rsquo;m glad you asked. Let&rsquo;s identify three characteristics of a diversified portfolio:</p><li> <strong>  A mix and a variety of asset classes. </strong> Diversified portfolios use a blend of equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), cash and cash equivalents (U.S. Government Treasury Bills), real estate and commodities (metals and energy). The main idea is to spread out risk across asset classes that behave differently under similar market conditions. For example, U.S. stocks and International stocks may not rise and fall together in the same fashion. Similar to our flip flop example above.</li><li> <strong>  Combine assets that behave differently. </strong> Diversified portfolios are balanced between both stocks and bonds. Historically, bonds fluctuate less than stocks but stocks usually generate larger returns (gains and dividends) and carry more risk of market fluctuations than bonds. Studies show that a portfolio balanced between both stocks and bonds tend to achieve returns almost as good as one solely invested in just stocks alone  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/guide-to-diversification\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source: Fidelity  </a> </u> . With proper diversification you may not achieve the largest gains in any year but you may manage to avoid the biggest losses.</li><li> <strong>  Diversified within each type of investment. </strong> Diversified portfolios avoid overconcentration in one stock or sector. Investments like ETFs  <u>  Related Four Benefits of ETF Investing </u>  and mutual funds increases diversification because they may invest in a large number of underlying securities of all different types. Furthermore, each asset class has its own unique risk and returns characteristics, for example U.S. Large Cap vs U.S. Small Cap. What&rsquo;s the difference? Small cap companies are focused more on the domestic economy and have an advantage over bigger multinational firms who rely more on overseas sales. Generally speaking when the dollar is strong, small cap companies benefit more. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  CONCLUSION: </strong></p><p> Remember, the main goal of diversification is to reduce risk in a portfolio. It cannot and will not completely eliminate the risk of losses. Success in investing comes down to many different factors, diversification being one of them.

{"original_id":3931,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Trip Up On Your Content Marketing in 2016","link":"dont-trip-up-on-your-content-marketing-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Nicole Leong </p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2016_Aus_Research_11.16.15_Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Marketing Institute&rsquo;s 2016 Benchmarks, Budgets and Trends  </a> </u>  report is out. Based on a survey of 146 for-profit marketers in Australia, the numbers tell all. Here&rsquo;s what they say about the current state of content marketing in Australia. ( <strong>  Hint: </strong>  most of us are doing it wrong.)</p><p> Now more than ever, Australian marketers are seeing the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/todd-wheatland-interview-why-content-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   importance of content and the benefits it brings to their brand  </a> </u> . Forty-six per cent of respondents say their organisations have documented content marketing strategies, up from 37% last year. And over half (55%) say their organisations are clear on what an effective or successful content marketing program looks like.</p><p> It seems peculiar then, that only 28% overall reported that their content marketing efforts were effective (defined as &ldquo;accomplishing your overall objectives&rdquo;), a slight dip from last year&rsquo;s 29%. To further confuse matters, content marketing tactics such as social media and paid promotion were rated more effective across the board as compared to 2015.</p><p> If promotion and tactical effectiveness were up &ndash; leading us to expect greater effectiveness &ndash; why the (albeit slight) dip in ratings for overall effectiveness?</p><p> The following common mistakes in content marketing may help explain it.</p><p> <img alt=\"chart1.jpg\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/hubfs/chart1.jpg?t=1452746846710&amp;width=452&amp;height=350\"/></p><p> One such downfall is  <strong>  expecting instant results. </strong>  Content marketing is a long-term play. It takes time to work. Among those who reported the best results from their content campaigns, the majority (64%) rated their content marketing maturity level as in the sophisticated/mature phase, with only nine per cent in the young/first steps phase. According to Joe Pulizzi&rsquo;s book  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/content-inc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Inc.  </a> </u> , it takes an average of 15 to 17 months of consistent content creation and distribution to reach monetisation, a.k.a. results.</p><p> Another major failure could be that the content is simply  <strong>  not fulfilling the unmet needs of the target audience </strong>  and therefore not valuable to them. Be sure to plan your content around your audience&rsquo;s content needs and map it to the buyer&rsquo;s journey.</p><p> <strong>  Focusing on the wrong metrics </strong>  gives us a distorted idea of whether our content is working. While new business leads, which most Australian marketers tend to focus on, is clearly the ultimate objective, there are  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/05/subscription-goal-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   other metrics that should be considered to optimise for long-term effectiveness  </a> </u> . It's also unwise to get too stuck on consumption metrics &ndash; they may tell you how many eyes were on your content but are less meaningful in terms of figuring out if your content is actually helping to drive business.</p><p> What  should  content marketers really be looking at then?</p><p> <img alt=\"Capturechart2.jpg\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/hubfs/Capturechart2.jpg?t=1452746846710&amp;width=465&amp;height=405\"/></p><p> The Content Marketing Institute found through qualitative research that the majority of content marketing approaches did not include subscription options.  <strong>  Only 68% of Australian marketers rated subscriber growth as an important metric. </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s behind sales lead quality, sales, higher conversion rates, website traffic, sales lead quantity, SEO ranking, purchase intent AND brand lift. Shouldn&rsquo;t a key goal of your content marketing plan be to build your audience over the long term? Generating this valuable asset turns your marketing spend from an expense to investment. Subscribers &ndash; to your blog or newsletter &ndash; have explicitly opted to hear more from your company. Creating an open channel of communication between you and the people who are most interested in your brand and what you have to say could be your best bet to get new customers.</p><p> Here are three ways to grow your audience in financial services marketing:</p><li> <strong>  Maximise online visibility </strong></li><li> Upload browser-friendly versions of your newsletters to your website</li><li> Share and re-share your content on your social channels</li><li> Use social sharing buttons in your emails and blog posts and ask your readers to share or forward to a friend</li><li> Implement SEO best practice to help your content be found</li><li> Leverage other people&rsquo;s audiences via guest blogging <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Make it easy for readers to subscribe  </strong></li><li> Implement prominent subscribe forms on your home page or blogs &ndash; try at the bottom of every article and/or lightbox pop-ups which appear after a minimum of 30 seconds</li><li> Pre-populate any fields in subscription forms with information you might already have</li><li> Use actionable language on call-to-actions. Instead of &ldquo;Sign up&rdquo;, use proactive words such as &ldquo;Subscribe for the latest market insights&rdquo;. This helps bring to mind the value of subscribing and the way the content will benefit the reader <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Make it attractive for readers to subscribe </strong></li><li> Offer other pieces of valuable content by suggesting related blog posts</li><li> Tell the audience about the themes and angles you are about to explore and invite them to join you on the journey</li><li> Offer exclusive content for your subscribers e.g. a free eBook for new subscribers <br/>  </li><p> Over the next 12 weeks we will share insights on what Australian financial services marketers NEED to know about content marketing. That includes content marketing for ROI, how to plan content your audience wants to read, and how to map your content to the buyer&rsquo;s journey. We might share the Ultimate Blog Template for financial services at the end of it. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 21:39:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 21:39:37.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_IrOzJlZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-trip-up-on-your-content-marketing-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8616\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 21:39:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 21:39:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-trip-up-on-your-content-marketing-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8615\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4078\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-trip-up-on-your-content-marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"444\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452853800,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

But speaking can be time consuming and costly.</p><p> <strong>  Enter the webinar. It&rsquo;s like a speaking engagement, only over an internet connection.  </strong> Webinars are powerful tools in your content marketing arsenal because you can schedule them, record them, archive them, and send them to prospects after the fact. You can even use them to hone your message.</p><p> You have a lot to offer your potential customers. Why not entice them with some free education that benefits you both?</p><p> <strong>  When people sign up for webinars, it generates qualified leads for your business. </strong>  Read on to learn how to attract more B2B leads online with free webinars.</p><h3> Webinars are great additions to your B2B marketing strategy <br/>  </h3><p> Could you use webinars to generate warm, qualified leads this year?</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/marketing-opportunity-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Talk to a B2B content marketing expert  </a> </u></p><h3> <strong>  Proven Benefits of Webinars </strong></h3><p> <br/> Webinars aren&rsquo;t just a great way to connect with clients and potential clients; they&rsquo;re a proven method of increasing leads.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/CMI/2015-b2b-content-marketing-benchmarks-budgets-and-trends-north-america-by-content-marketing-institute-and-marketingprofs?related=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a survey taken by the Content Marketing Institute  </a> </u> ,  <strong>  61 percent of B2B companies use webinars as a content marketing tactic. </strong></p><p> That same survey revealed that in 2015,  <strong>  webinars were rated as the most effective lead generation tool for B2B marketing </strong> , second only to in-person events. And there&rsquo;s a reason they work.</p><h3> <strong>  Four Advantages of Webinars </strong></h3><p> <br/> Offering free webinars engages your audience in a manner not met by other methods. At no cost, webinars can:</p><li> Attract an audience with strong intent to buy</li><li> Create a bridge between companies without geographical boundaries</li><li> Promote partnerships between businesses</li><li> Provide more information and a chance to ask questions in a non-threatening environment. <br/>  </li><p> Free webinars allow your company to share a topic you know well with companies that have a vested interest in what you have to say.</p><p> Presenting the information in this dynamic format with chances to engage your audience in real time is a win-win for all parties. The webinar format creates an opportunity to forge new relationships and foster those you&rsquo;ve already created.</p><h3> <strong>  Tips for Increasing Webinar Leads </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Create compelling content.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re looking to earn new contacts, webinar content is very important.  <strong>  Share expertise and perspective, not product demonstrations. Don&rsquo;t sell, educate. </strong></p><p> Share information your attendees can&rsquo;t get anywhere else. Make it unique.</p><p> When preparing the webinar,  <u>  make the content evergreen </u>  so you can use it again as a part of your lead generation campaign year-round.</p><h3> Promote, promote, promote.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t just use a registration page on your website and email list to promote the free webinar. </strong>  Leverage partnerships and existing relationships to get the word out.</p><p> Social media is a great place to start.  <strong>  Post on multiple social media channels, and post at least every 3 days for a month leading up to the webinar. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t get discouraged &mdash; most of your registrations will come the days before the event.</p><p> If your target audience uses Twitter regularly, start a custom hashtag (which you can track and turn into more leads) and use social media to its fullest potential to attract clients and generate excitement.</p><p> Consider creating a sense of urgency by limiting the number of &ldquo;seats&rdquo; available for each session.</p><h3> Follow-up with attendees. <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into preparing and giving your webinar, and  <strong>  you need a follow-up communication plan after the webinar. </strong></p><p> Now is the time to use an email campaign. Show your appreciation for each attendee by  <u>  following up with a thank-you email </u> . Offer a special link to download the presentation or watch the recording.</p><p> Further the relationship with a call to action, and invite them to ask questions that weren&rsquo;t covered during the webinar.</p><p> Finally, consider calling each new prospect within 3-4 days of the webinar and ask if the content was helpful. You may learn about a potential business opportunity from the phone call.</p><p> As a tactic to generate more leads to start 2016, we worked on an informational webinar with a client. We started promotion weeks in advance of the webinar, and 143 participants signed up to participate. 24 of those contacts were brand new to the company.</p><p> Free webinars can be your ticket to increased  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing/lead-generation-lead-nurturing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   B2B lead generation  </a> </u> .

We spend hours each week , up to four years of our lives, shifting low value (or no value) information from one place in our organisation to another.Despite this, email apologists will tell you it doesn&rsquo;t really need to be tamed . There really isn&rsquo;t a problem: email , for all its faults, is the best thing we have right now. I don&rsquo;t believe that for a second. <u>  <a href=\"http://uk.atos.net/en-uk/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ATOS  </a> </u>  chief  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Breton\" target=\"_blank\">   Thierry Breton  </a> </u> , who has banned internal email, estimated that barely 10% of the 200 messages his employees received on an average day were useful. ATOS calculated that managers spent between five and 20 hours a week reading and writing emails. <u>  Nick Atkin </u>  of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.haltonhousing.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Halton Housing  </a> </u>  has announced that internal email will end from this February. He&rsquo;s said it&rsquo;s part of a fundamental rethink of how the organisation works, stating &ldquo;We are taking back control from some of the systems and cultures we have all allowed to develop during the 20 years email has been part of our working lives.&rdquo;Email is undeniably wasteful but my problem with it runs deeper. Email represents anti-social business. It locks down knowledge in silos. It reinforces hierarchy and disconnected thinking. It promotes an insidious system of cc&rsquo;ing and , even worse , bcc&rsquo;ing as a way of denying accountability.  Despite that I do use email &ndash; it still has uses, but needs replacing as the default way we choose to do work. Is it possible to seriously tame email without turning it off completely? Yes. I&rsquo;ve managed to reduce the time I spend on email by about 75% by adopting six rules.The results speak for themselves &ndash; when I took nearly 3 weeks off work last September I returned to only 20 emails.So , in the spirit of open knowledge sharing, here&rsquo;s my six tips for a saner inbox: <strong>  1: Don&rsquo;t send any  </strong> This is by far the most effective thing you can do. Every email you send begs a reply &ndash; sometimes several. By pressing send you are literally making work for yourself &ndash; which is a pretty stupid thing to do. Copying people in to every email is not effective information sharing. There are loads of better tools for keeping people informed of what you&rsquo;re working on (Note: they probably aren&rsquo;t interested anyway.) <strong>  2: Use WhatsApp for chats </strong> Since the formation of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bromfordlab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bromford Lab  </a> </u> , we&rsquo;ve turned off in-team email and moved to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Whatsapp  </a> </u> . WhatsApp is great for creating groups and promoting a more social place to chat and interact without the annoyance of email threads. It eliminates team spam about cakes and whose birthday it is. And it&rsquo;s loads more fun too. <strong>  3: Create a &ldquo;Yesterbox&rdquo; </strong> I&rsquo;m shamelessly stole this tip from  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zappos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zappos  </a> </u>  CEO  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tony Hsieh  </u>  . </a> The idea: Only deal with yesterday&rsquo;s emails today.The rule: If it can wait 48 hours without causing harm, then you are not allowed to respond to any emails that come in today, even if it&rsquo;s a simple one-word reply. You need to psychologically train yourself to not worry about emails that are coming in&hellip;.You can read an outline of the concept at  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/yesterbox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yesterbox.com  </a> </u> It&rsquo;s worked well for me as you have a much better sense of which to prioritise &ndash; as well as ruthlessly deleting any that aren&rsquo;t worthy of attention. Which leads us to&hellip; <strong>  4: Delete any that are three days old  </strong> This takes some bravery &ndash; but trust me it works. If you haven&rsquo;t looked at something for three days it simply can&rsquo;t be very important. Delete it. If anyone is bothered they will chase you up on it. 90% of the time they don&rsquo;t &ndash; it was low value work that never really needed doing. <strong>  5: Restrict mail to just four sentences. </strong> If you do get an email from me you&rsquo;ll see this: <a href=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-19-at-19-44-59.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-19 at 19.44.59\" src=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-19-at-19-44-59.png?w=639&amp;h=121\"/> </a> By cutting down the waffle and getting to the point you save time for yourself and the recipient. The link takes you to  <u>  <a href=\"http://four.sentenc.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this site  </a> </u>  which explains why verbose mails are toxic. If you want to be more radical you can take it down to  <u>  <a href=\"http://three.sentenc.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   three  </a> </u>  lines, or if you&rsquo;re really hardcore,  <u>  <a href=\"http://two.sentenc.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   two  </a> </u> . <strong>  6: Unsubscribe from   everything  </strong> Make it part of your day to unsubscribe from at least five email lists. Email marketeers breed like rabbits but you can stem the flow by turning off their constant distractions.  Don&rsquo;t just delete them and hope they will go away &ndash; they won&rsquo;t. Also go into the notification settings of any work networks like Yammer you are part of. Turn them off &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see a huge difference instantly.I&rsquo;ve seen radically different results from using these six tips, I hope you found them useful.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 21:54:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 21:54:41.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_EQ7ndlX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-ways-to-kill-email/\", \"post_id\": \"8620\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 21:54:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 21:54:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-ways-to-kill-email\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8619\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4080\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-Ways-to-Kill-Email.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"487\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452888900,"author_id":383,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3935,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Simplicity","link":"simplicity","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Simplicity comes through cleaning out our physical, emotional, and metaphorical closets and letting go of what&rsquo;s no longer needed.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve been fascinated lately by the minimalism movement and what has emerged from that. People are drastically decluttering and downsizing their possessions and/or moving into tiny houses. When I first started reading about these concepts, I&rsquo;d think, &ldquo;Wow! What a sacrifice! I could never do that.&rdquo;  But now I&rsquo;m not so sure it is a sacrifice. As I&rsquo;ve been doing some massive decluttering of my own, I am starting to see the benefits of not having so much stuff. There is less to keep clean, less to take care of, and less to distract me from what matters most in life. I&rsquo;m learning that simplifying has been improving the quality of my life.</p><p> In my physical spaces, I&rsquo;ve been working to purge the possessions that I no longer need and have been letting go of items that no longer bring me joy. I was holding on to a lot of stuff in case I needed it &ldquo;someday.&rdquo; I used to have a hard time parting with things from my childhood or that I received as gifts. I felt some obligation to keep these things, even though I wasn&rsquo;t using them.</p><p> One area that I&rsquo;ve struggled with for years is my closet - it&rsquo;s been overstuffed with too many clothes that I didn&rsquo;t like and I never or rarely wore. Every once in a while, I&rsquo;d purge a few items to donate, but then I&rsquo;d go buy more to fill the empty spaces because I had &ldquo;nothing to wear.&rdquo; There have been too many mornings where valuable minutes were wasted as I stood there, trying to choose the day&rsquo;s outfit. After one instance where I wasted a full hour stressing about what to wear to a gathering, I decided enough was enough. It was time to clean out my closet once and for all. So I invested about three hours one afternoon to tackle the project. I assembled the outfits that I have worn most frequently and that I actually enjoy wearing and hung those items together in the closet. Then I went through every remaining article of clothing and made a conscious choice about whether or not I was going to keep it. I kept a few of these &ldquo;extras&rdquo; and got rid of the rest. I went through every single accessory too - scarves, hats, and jewelry - and again kept only the ones that bring me joy and that coordinate with the outfits.</p><h3> Decluttering our physical spaces can be overwhelming. But I&rsquo;ve found it easier by asking myself these types of questions: <br/>  </h3><li> Does this item bring me joy? Does it beautify my home or does it create mental clutter?</li><li> Is this item associated with a strong, positive memory?</li><li> When was the last time I used/wore the item?</li><li> Does this clothing item make me feel fabulous when I wear it?</li><li> If I were moving tomorrow and could only take one half of my belongings, would I take this? <br/>  </li><p> I&rsquo;ve also been taking swift action to address areas of our home that were draining my energy. As one small example, I used to dread doing laundry. When we transitioned from a top-loader to a front loader, there was not enough space to open the door all the way because of how the room was set up. It was really difficult to get the clothes in and out of the washer and dryer. It was awkward and cramped, and the annoyance and frustration was really depleting my energy. After dealing with it for several years (too long), I finally enlisted the support of my spouse and we invested time and money into reworking the room. It wasn&rsquo;t a major overhaul; we didn&rsquo;t knock down any walls. We took down old shelves leftover from previous owners that weren&rsquo;t functional for us. We had the electricity and HVAC system moved so we could move the washer and dryer to another wall, and we bought a stacking kit to save space. These changes created more space to install a more functional shelving unit to hide everything else out of sight, which also provides extra storage (and I&rsquo;m pleased to report that several months after this change, there is still empty space in there!). Addressing this nuisance and making a few simple changes alleviated mountains of frustration and stress that I felt several days each week.</p><p> As I&rsquo;ve been decluttering my home, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the areas that were most &ldquo;out of control&rdquo; were metaphors and external manifestations of what I was experiencing in my personal or professional life. For example, it wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that my office space was chaotic and overwhelming. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything, I was easily distracted, and I was not comfortable in the space. As I worked through this with a professional organizer, I saw the connection between the chaos in my physical work space and the chaos I felt professionally and in my business. And more recently, the clutter in my closet was an external manifestation of what I had been keeping in my metaphorical/emotional closet - the past hurts and grudges I&rsquo;ve been holding on for too long. Over the last year, I&rsquo;ve been attending to strained relationships, letting go of grudges and anger, and learning to forgive people (including myself). Shining the light on what was blocking the flow of connection and love in my life, and doing the work to let those blocks go, has made a tremendous difference in how I approach my most cherished relationships.</p><p> The process of simplifying can be overwhelming, and it&rsquo;s not always easy. It can be scary, as we fear what we&rsquo;ll be losing or sacrificing as we let things go. In reality, when we simplify, we don&rsquo;t lose out. We gain. We gain more time, more energy, and more freedom. We create more space to focus on what matters the most, and we create the space that&rsquo;s needed for peace, joy and love to grow in our soul.</p><h3> Take Inspired Action: <br/>  </h3><li> What areas of your home or life are in need of decluttering?</li><li> Where are you doing too much?</li><li> What issues are draining your energy?</li><li> What is one simple action you can take this week to reduce the chaos and create more space in your life?</li>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-14 22:34:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-14 22:34:29.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_yzoYQgd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/simplicity/\", \"post_id\": \"8623\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-14 22:34:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-14 22:34:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"simplicity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8621\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4082\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Think-Deeply-Set-Goals-and-Grow-Rich.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"394\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1452885000,"author_id":468,"chart_url":""}

I was born and raised by lighter-hued parents in a predominantly Black neighborhood, surrounded by my family and friends who were a wide array of brown and I was/am influenced heavily by Black culture and history.</h3><p> <br/> Being in Human Resources as a Black Woman has always felt like a privilege to me. I have the ability to make sure there is job opportunity and pay equity and fair treatment for people who look like me. When someone is mistreated because of their race or their gender or some other external thing that has nothing to do with their work, I have the ability to make it right. And I take that responsibility very very seriously.</p><p> However, I don&rsquo;t talk about race issues at work &hellip; I don&rsquo;t initiate conversations about race at all, unless I&rsquo;m dealing directly with an issue specific to the organization. And I don&rsquo;t participate in conversations that happen in my hearing, other than to express general sadness and disappointment about the state of race and gender relations right now.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t talk about how I see White privilege all around me and how oblivious most White people are to its existence. The privilege is like air and the use of it is like breathing. Because most White people aren&rsquo;t actively seeking to oppress others, they miss the subtle ways privilege sneaks into their actions and interactions with People of Color. Like the assumption that one or two People of Color  in a room can sufficiently or appropriately represent the whole group. Or the assertion that the same or slightly greater effort by People of Color will yield the same results as their White counterparts.</p><h3> I don&rsquo;t talk about the lack of diversity in the upper management levels in most organizations.</h3><p> <br/> There are Women and People of Color in a lot of entry-level and mid-level positions in organizations. However, when you look at the VP level and the C-suite in most organizations, diversity is sorely lacking and no one is doing anything about it. We&rsquo;ve been shamed into thinking deliberately hiring for diversity is inappropriate and wrong. And HR professionals who speak out about this risk being un-invited from that precious seat at the table where they can drive and influence strategy; they end up relegated to administration and policy enforcement, which ultimately perpetuates all the negative stereotypes about the HR profession.</p><h3> I don&rsquo;t talk about how lack of opportunities for People of Color and Women force us into unwritten, silent competition with each other in the workplace.</h3><p> <br/> We are harder on each other and demand higher levels of loyalty because there are so few of us. We expect that we&rsquo;ll look out for one another and that we&rsquo;ll work hard to make each other look good &hellip; We are also quick to turn on one another. We will not allow each other to slack or make errors because we fear it will reflect poorly on the rest of us. We also recognize White Male privilege doesn&rsquo;t leave room for all of us to rise so we fight each other for the few slots we&rsquo;re allotted.</p><h3> I don&rsquo;t talk about how much the state of race and gender relations right now leave me feeling hurt, angry, afraid and alone.</h3><p> <br/> Hurt that People of Color and Women across the US are being killed and abused but there is rarely justice for the wrongs against them. Angry that so many people go along without seeming to notice or to use their privilege to help make change and improvements. Afraid that People of Color and Women will continue to be oppressed and forced to compete with each other in unhealthy ways. Afraid that my children will either end up with the same nervous, semi-jaded views as me &mdash; or that they won&rsquo;t have enough of these views to maneuver and defend themselves against the discrimination that surely awaits them. Alone because I spend 40+ hours each week denying and suppressing these thoughts and feelings so I can function while I work at the excellence that is expected of me by myself and those I work with and for.</p><h3> If I started talking about these things, I&rsquo;m not sure I could ever stop.</h3><p> <br/> If I started talking about these things, I&rsquo;m not sure the people I work with &mdash; men, women, whites and people of color &mdash; could handle it.

{"original_id":3937,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Commit to a Great Communication Strategy in 2016","link":"commit-to-a-great-communication-strategy-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Over the holidays, I spent a week in Tulum, Mexico on the Yucatan Peninsula. While communication best practices might not be the first thing you&rsquo;d think of on a beach vacation, my mind kept wandering back to a sixth grade history lesson about how the Yucatan got its name.</p><p> In the 1500s, when Spanish explorers first encountered the Mayan civilization, they noted that the locals kept saying &ldquo;Yucatan! Yucatan!&rdquo; They figured, &ldquo;Hey, that must be the name of this place&rdquo;! And the name stuck. But there was a catch. It turns out &ldquo;Yucatan&rdquo; roughly translates into &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo; In other words, they renamed an already inhabited, expansive section of Mexico the &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Understand What You&rsquo;re Saying Peninsula.&rdquo; Had the Spanish Explorers taken the time to listen, learn and respect the Mayan language, a more sensible outcome might have ensued.</p><h3> Our industry is suffering a communications crisis of its own. </h3><p> <br/> In fact, a wealth of industry statistics cite poor communication as a top reason clients fire their financial advisor. Too often, our clients just don&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;re saying. So in the spirit of the new year &mdash; and because I&rsquo;m not quite ready to let go of my vacation &mdash; here are three tips for ensuring that your clients do understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p><p> <strong>  Cut Out the Jargon </strong>  &mdash; Clients shouldn&rsquo;t need a master&rsquo;s degree to understand how their investments are working for them. Worse yet, if you do use terms such as alphas, betas and standard deviations with clients, clients are likely to nod their head in agreement because they don&rsquo;t want to look uneducated. As Mark Twain said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use a five-dollar word when a fifty-cent word will do.&rdquo; Our industry is filled with some pretty smart people. The smartest ones are able to translate complicated ideas into plain, colloquial language that clients can easily understand.</p><p> <strong>  Use Visuals to Reinforce Your Messaging </strong>  &mdash; The human brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text. People are hard-wired to absorb visuals faster than words and to retain them better. 2  Furthermore, by combining visuals and text, human comprehension and retention is optimized. With today&rsquo;s shortened attention spans, it&rsquo;s important to get your message across clearly and succinctly, and 40% of learners respond better to visual information than text alone. 3  Luckily for our industry (not always the most artistic), there is a wealth of high quality, professional stock photos online at little to no cost. Sites like Dreamstime and iStock can get you started.</p><p> <strong>  Press the Repeat Button for Important Messages </strong>  &mdash; Research shows the majority of people need to hear your messages three to five times to believe it. 4  Being persistent is crucial to being truly heard and appreciated by your clients. While leading Merrill Lynch&rsquo;s Global Wealth Management division, industry veteran Sallie Krawchek ran the numbers. She asked clients if they were being communicated with not enough, just enough, or too much. And she found that even clients who said they were being contacted too much had higher retention rates than the &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; and &ldquo;not enough&rdquo; clients. 5</p><h3> When it comes to being a financial advisor, great communication is paramount to your success.</h3><p> <br/> It can mean the difference between having a rocky relationship or a stellar relationship with your clients. These tips are just a start to a more meaningful client communication strategy. In the next Navigator Insights, we&rsquo;ll discuss how advisors can use technology like video conferencing and marketing automation to save time while enhancing their overall client communication strategy.</p>1.

{"original_id":3939,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Reality Check: 4 Media Trends That Might Surprise You","link":"reality-check-4-media-trends-that-might-surprise-you","source_link":null,"content":"Written by: <u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jesskemery\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Jessica Emery </a></u>The evolution of the media industry is often a conversation fraught with negativity. From the termination of reporters who have been in the industry for years to the elimination of print publications, it can be hard to find a positive angle to the &ldquo;news about the news.&rdquo;However, there are a number of trends that might surprise even the most seasoned media veterans. By following these developments and knowing how to take advantage of them, PR professionals can help their clients remain relevant and allow their content to have real staying power.<h3> 1. Popularity of local TV news</h3>Despite iPhones and tablets providing constant and immediate access to breaking news, more than half (55 percent) of U.S. adults say they consume their news on television, with local TV broadcast remaining the primary choice. Given these statistics, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there are often broadcast opportunities right in your own backyard. International news topics, for example, can be applied to your local landscape, such as how falling oil prices can impact consumers or what the volatility in China could mean for your retirement portfolio.<h3> 2. Digitization of news reporting</h3>Robos are not just invading the advisor space, they&rsquo;re taking over newsrooms, too. While many never thought news reporters could be replaced by technology, there are some cases where this is happening already. Reporters are using algorithms to help them expand coverage, engage audiences, and respond to breaking news. The New York Times recently developed one such robo called <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/08/the-new-york-times-built-a-slack-bot-to-help-decide-which-stories-to-post-to-social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Blossom</a>, which sorts through the performance of the Times&rsquo; daily stories on social media and determines which articles will receive the most traction. It also searches old content for stories related to breaking news that might be worth re-sharing. Blossom posts get about 380 percent more clicks than a typical non-Blossom post.<h3> 3. Growing election staffs</h3>Journalist layoffs have been a huge story dominating headlines across the country. But as we prepare for the 2016 election, many publications are actually <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/2016-campaigns-are-beefing-up-staffs-so-are-the-media-who-will-cover-them/2015/02/23/9f1d2152-a66b-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> amping</a> up their staffs. CNN has doubled its political reporting team and Bloomberg has added two dozen people to a new unit dedicated to national politics. Sam Feist, CNN&rsquo;s Washington bureau chief, told The Washington Post that CNN will &ldquo;spend more money on the 2016 campaign than on any campaign in history.&rdquo; This is where<a href=\"http://www.thenewshackers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> newshacking</a> can be key to a PR strategy. Given the appetite for election-related news, reporters will be seeking expert sources to comment on the potential impact candidates&rsquo; economic policies could have on retirement, college savings and Social Security, to name a few.<h3> 4. Established players leading the change</h3>There seems to be a common belief that the emergence of new media outlets (whether it be high-circulation blogs or social media), is pushing traditional media outlets to the wayside. This is not the case. Top-tier outlets remain at the head of the pack in terms of innovating their platforms and providing viewers and readers with the most up-to-date means of consuming content. Outlets such as The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Washington Post and The Associated Press continue to evolve by growing their digital platforms. They also understand the importance of catering their content to digital landscapes, whether it be mobile or video, in order to foster stronger engagement with their audience.As consumer desires and behavior continue to drive the media&rsquo;s evolution, successful outlets will chase new audiences and employ new tactics to keep up with their changing preferences. When trying to place a client&rsquo;s story into this fast-paced news cycle,  financial services PR professionals must understand the different forces shaping the media landscape.<strong> But don&rsquo;t forget, these trends are not always exactly as they appear.</strong>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-17 01:44:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-17 01:44:29.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_42mFmar.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/reality-check-4-media-trends-that-might-surprise-you/\", \"post_id\": \"8627\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-17 01:44:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-17 01:44:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"reality-check-4-media-trends-that-might-surprise-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8621\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4086\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Think-Deeply-Set-Goals-and-Grow-Rich.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"286\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453119300,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3941,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Not-So-Affordable Care Act","link":"the-not-so-affordable-care-act","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> A few months ago I scoffed when my wife told me about a report from  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/02/news/economy/obamacare-rates/\" target=\"_blank\">   CNN  </a> </u>  that the average individual, unsubsidized health insurance premium was going up over 60%.</h3><p> <br/> After receiving my 2016 premium notice from Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, I&rsquo;m no longer scoffing. My monthly premium for family coverage went from $1,400 to $2,140, an increase of $740, or 53%. According to healthcare.gov, the average Wellmark increase in South Dakota is 43%.</p><p> I immediately started looking for ways to decrease my premiums. This has become an annual ritual ever since Obamacare was pushed through Congress in 2010. Back then, my family health insurance policy (now considered a Platinum plan) had a low deductible with a maximum out-of-pocket of $3,500 and cost $660 a month.</p><h3> Despite the President&rsquo;s promise that &ldquo;If you like your plan you can keep your plan,&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t even purchase that same plan today.</h3><p> <br/> If I could, I estimate it would cost over $3,500 a month. In order to keep health insurance affordable, each year I&rsquo;ve reduced my coverage, increased my deductibles, and paid a higher premium than the year before.</p><p> I set out to  <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/insurance/do-research-to-find-best-health-insurance-options\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   analyze my options  </a> </u>  for 2016. After spending six hours crunching numbers and pouring over online calculators, I admitted defeat. There is no simple way to analyze plans to determine whether, based on your personal health care expenditures, you are better served to go with a copay or a deductible plan, a Bronze or a Silver plan, or if a Health Savings Account is preferable to a plan with coinsurance. All the online calculators I found were limited in scope and woefully generic. My health insurance agent didn&rsquo;t know of any better ones, either.</p><p> Adding to my angst, while Wellmark makes policyholders&rsquo; year-to-date healthcare expenses available on its website, it doesn&rsquo;t provide any breakdown of costs. You must figure out for yourself how many drug or doctor co-pays you had, the average cost of a copay visit, the average total costs of those visits, and any other information you need for any type of analysis.</p><h3> This task was daunting for me, a financial planner and numbers guy. How are average consumers supposed to navigate it? The need for this information is so obvious, one wonders what the insurance companies are hiding by not providing it.</h3><p> <br/> Ultimately, I selected a Bronze plan with no copays and an out-of-pocket cap of $11,900 on in-network providers and $18,500 on out-of-network providers. Based on my family&rsquo;s average health care costs for the last three years, my out-of-pocket spending for premiums, covered drugs, and approved in-network medical providers will be $2,612 per month, or $31,344, in 2016. It was $11,420 in 2010. That&rsquo;s an increase of 273%, or 18.3% a year.</p><p> By comparison, during the same time period medical costs only increased 16.0%, or 2.7% a year. The increase in premiums is clearly not about increasing health costs.</p><p> The $1,660 extra per month I had available to spend on consumer goods and services in 2010 is now going to insurance companies to subsidize the health care of others. This is a clear-cut example of a massive transfer of wealth.</p><p> Based on my family&rsquo;s needs, if I earned $97,000 a year I would qualify for a subsidy of $912 a month. But since I earn over $98,000, I pay the full premium.</p><p> Clearly, the only people who find the Affordable Care Act affordable are those who receive a subsidy or who have preexisting conditions. For them, Obamacare was a godsend. <strong>  For the rest of us, it turned out to be one of the most devious tax increases in modern history. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-17 17:42:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-17 17:42:04.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_saGJ8I1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-not-so-affordable-care-act/\", \"post_id\": \"8630\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-17 17:42:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-17 17:42:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-not-so-affordable-care-act\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8631\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4088\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Not-So-Affordable-Care-Act.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"676\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453129200,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3942,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Where to Travel For The Best Stargazing In The World","link":"where-to-travel-for-the-best-stargazing-in-the-world","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkTravel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark Crone  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://markstraveljournal.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark's Travel Journal  </u> </a> In most urban areas, only around 500 stars are visible on a given night, but in the prized locations highlighted below, up to 15,000 are easily seen. That&rsquo;s pretty incredible. It you&rsquo;re planning a trip and want some nighttime eye candy, here are six of the best places in the world to go outside and look up.</p><h3> Mauna Kea, Hawaii</h3>The Mauna Kea volcano on Hawaii&rsquo;s Big Island has perhaps the most ideal stargazing conditions in the world. At an elevation above 13,000 feet, it is the highest point in Hawaii. Its high elevation and location in the middle of the Pacific create excellent conditions, but the surrounding cloud layer makes it even more perfect for studying the sky. A tropical inversion cloud layer 2,000 feet thick sits below the summit, preventing pollutants and moist air from the ocean from rising up. The view itself is so spectacular that one of the world&rsquo;s most advanced astronomical observatories is located at the top. The <u> <a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  visitor&rsquo;s center </a></u> at 9,000 feet offers lectures, question and answer sessions, and telescope viewing.<h3> Cherry Springs State Park, Pennsylvania</h3>Pennsylvania might seem like an odd place for first-class stargazing, but Cherry Springs State Park is one of the best viewing points in the world. The 82 acre park is set within the 262,000 acre Susquehannock State Forest, protecting it from light pollution. A tremendous number of stars are visible at this Gold-Certified International Dark Sky Park. In fact, the sky is so dark that the Northern Lights were seen here four times in 2014, a very unusual event this far below the Arctic Circle. The park offers <u> <a href=\"http://events.dcnr.pa.gov/event/night_sky_tour_6288#.VgrS4yBViko\" target=\"_blank\">  Night Sky Tours </a></u> on Friday and Saturday nights that use lasers to identify and explain constellations and planets. Visitors can also use telescopes on site.<h3> Atacama Desert, Chile</h3>The Atacama Desert in Chile is already a stunning natural wonder with its red dunes, huge rock formations, and even a desert flowering in wet years. It&rsquo;s also the driest non-polar desert in the world due to its high elevation, which makes it an exceptionally perfect place for stargazing. The newly constructed <u> <a href=\"http://www.almaobservatory.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ALMA Observatory </a></u> takes advantage of these conditions and the lack of light pollution in the desert. At times, the Milky Way can shine so brightly here that it casts a shadow on the desert floor.<h3> Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah</h3>In 2007, Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah became the first ever International Dark Sky Park, a designation since reserved for the best stargazing locations in the world. The beauty of the stars visible in the desert is supplemented by the <u> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nabr/learn/nature/darkskypark.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  striking natural setting </a></u>. Owachomo bridge, perhaps the oldest bridge in the park, was created when a river changed course and carved a hole into solid rock.<img alt=\"\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/star-gazing.png\" width=\"630\"/><h3> Denali National Park, Alaska</h3>The Northern Lights are caused by a <u> <a href=\"https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/EPO/auroral_poster/aurora_all.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  coronal mass ejection </a></u>, which is a gust of solar wind and magnetic fields that interact with the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The result are stunning dancing waves of green, red, blue, and violet that are occasionally visible in northern climates. Denali National Park in Alaska is one of the best places for viewing the phenomenon. The park encompasses four million acres of federally protected land, and the cold and clear Alaskan nights made conditions ideal. The magnificent park also offers bears, wolves, caribou, and moose as well as some of the most stunning mountain views in the world.<h3> Troms&oslash;, Norway</h3>Brave stargazers might seek to venture inside the Arctic Circle itself for viewing the northern lights. There&rsquo;s no better place to experience the enchanted north than <u> <a href=\"http://www.visitnorway.com/en/what-to-do/attractions-culture/nature-attractions-in-norway/the-northern-lights/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Troms&oslash; </a></u>. Not only does it offer fantastic views of the aurora borealis (the sun is invisible from November to January), it&rsquo;s a lovely city in its own right. In the 19th century it was called the Paris of the North, and visitors can enjoy reindeer spotting, sledding with huskies, and visiting the famous Arctic Cathedral in this Norse and Sami medieval city.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-17 17:55:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-17 17:55:56.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_rFz0G6M.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/where-to-travel-for-the-best-stargazing-in-the-world/\", \"post_id\": \"8634\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-17 17:55:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-17 17:55:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"where-to-travel-for-the-best-stargazing-in-the-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8632\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4089\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Where-to-Travel-For-The-Best-Stargazing-In-The-World.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"863\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453143600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3943,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"I Have a Dream","link":"i-have-a-dream","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><h3> I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</h3><p> <br/> Five score years ago,  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\" target=\"_blank\">   a great American  </a> </u> , in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/\" target=\"_blank\">   Emancipation Proclamation  </a> </u> . This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p><p> But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p><p> In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/declarationofindependence.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Declaration of Independence  </a> </u> , they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"</p><p> But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p><p> We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.</p><p> It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p><p> But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.</p><p> The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.</p><h3> We cannot walk alone.</h3><p> <br/> And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.</p><h3> We cannot turn back.</h3><p> <br/> There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. *We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\"* We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\" &sup1;</p><p> I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.</p><p> Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.</p><p> And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</p><p> I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"</p><p> I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</p><p> I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p><p> I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p><h3> I have a dream today!</h3><p> <br/> I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and \"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.</p><h3> I have a dream today!</h3><p> <br/> I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\" 2</p><p> This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.</p><p> With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.</p><p> And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:</p><p> My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.</p><p> Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,</p><p> From every mountainside, let freedom ring!</p><p> And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.</p><p> And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.</p><p> Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.</p><p> Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.</p><p> Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.</p><p> Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.</p><p> But not only that:</p><p> Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.</p><p> Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.</p><p> Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.</p><p> From every mountainside, let freedom ring.</p><p> And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:</p><h3> Free at last!

The recipient just has to hit play, then sit back and eat a banana or something while they listen and watch.  Video doesn&rsquo;t tend to be a medium which requires the viewer to actively concentrate &ndash; they don&rsquo;t have to read, interpret meaning and analyse in the same way they do with text only messages.</p><p> It is particularly useful when engaging with existing clients and contacts (although definitely doesn&rsquo;t need to be restricted to just those who have a relationship with you already) because there is the sense of it being a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo;, rather than a missive, or instructions.  Also, video is rapidly becoming the preferred medium for many who are in information overload.  Relatively quick to engage with, and the addition of body language, tonality and inflexion video helps clarify a message.  How many times have all of us sat reading a text only email and spent time trying to figure out the tone of the message, and what the sender was really implying?  Video tends to leaves no doubt about what was meant.</p><h3> As a means of communicating rapidly and effectively with clients there is no question that combining video with email can be effective.  </h3><p> <br/> It should go without saying, but a boring, dry or dull presenter remains a boring, dry, dull presenter regardless of the medium, so we ned to bring a bit of zing to the show.  As video is a one-way conversation in reality we have to lift the energy level a little more than usual &ndash; but we are not aiming for frenetic and zany!  Just lift the energy, pace and inflexion a degree or two more than is normal, and that gives the video a bit of life.</p><p> The process is fairly simple, and rather than repeat it here, just go to the following link and it will show you how to embed video in a handful of simple steps:   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Embed-Video-in-Email\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How To Embed Video In Email  </a> </u></p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t begun sending video&rsquo;s to clients and prospects in your emails yet, then make that a definite &ldquo;to do&rdquo; this year.

{"original_id":3945,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Secret Sauce to Influencer Marketing","link":"the-secret-sauce-to-influencer-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As the informational age continues to mature, more and more of the general public is turning a blind eye to traditional forms of advertising. Because of this, businesses and marketers alike have had to formulate new and innovative methods to reach these folks: Enter influencer marketing.</p><p> Influencer marketing leverages the status of highly influential individuals in various niches to reach specific audiences with a company&rsquo;s message about products, services, or whatever else.</p><p> In recent years, thanks to the power of social media and digital connectivity, this form of marketing has become one of the most dynamic and powerful ways to expand a company&rsquo;s reach and public awareness, boost organizational credibility, and spread the brand&rsquo;s gospel far and wide. Yet many companies still ferociously struggle with taking advantage of this leading new form of marketing.</p><p> While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to influencer marketing, there surely is a secret sauce to getting these authoritative figures on your side and launching a campaign for the record books. Let&rsquo;s check out some of the most important ingredients.</p><h3> Ingredient #1: Understand Your Audience</h3><p> <br/> While knowing your audience, their pain-points, and common characteristics, is massively important, we won&rsquo;t spend too much time on the subject since this is the foundation of all marketing efforts. Do keep in mind, however, that if you are unclear on your audience, you will almost certainly select the wrong influencers.</p><p> To understand these folks in an intimate way, you must first understand your brand in the same manner. Who are you? What is your message? What key demographics would benefit most from your offerings? Additionally, one of the greatest and most simplistic ways to understand you audience is to ask them who they are. Send out surveys to gather information on age, gender, biggest frustrations relating to your niche, and so forth to gain a comprehensive picture of who you customers are.</p><p> Free Bonus: Learn how to use influencer marketing in your next campaign.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZx3au2gCoY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Click here to watch the bonus video  </u>  . </a></p><h3> Ingredient #2: Finding the Right Influencers</h3><p> <br/> Once you know exactly who your audience is, you can really tap into the right types of influencers for your efforts. You probably already have an idea of who some of these folks might be, but you need to delve deep into this search to find the most effective people for your campaign.</p><p> Social is of course the easiest way to locate these individuals. Simply conduct a topic search and find out who is making the most noise and really leading the charge around the subject. Additionally, tools like  <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Buzzsumo </a> , Topsy, GroupHigh, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://klear.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Klear  </a> </u>  are indispensable tools in your search for influential allies.</p><p> Scour every possible avenue of these tools to locate the best people for the job. Understand that this is no small undertaking and will take time to accomplish.</p><p> Once you have located your influencers, connect with them on social; follow them, re-tweet them, add value to ongoing conversations on their feeds. Really try to gain their attention in a positive way before reaching you with your requests. We&rsquo;ll dive deeper into this portion of the campaign in a bit. It&rsquo;s important stuff and requires its own section.</p><h3> Ingredient #3: Understanding Influencers versus Advocates</h3><p> <br/> Before you begin to connect with all of these people that you have meticulously hunted down, you need to understand that just because a person has excellent reach and discusses topics in your niche, that doesn&rsquo;t exactly make them an influencer.</p><p> Influencers are those who are genuinely driving and shaping the conversations that are discussed, not just nodding their heads in agreeance. Additionally, these folks must be reaching the right audience for your needs; not just any audience will do. When trying to determine which category a person falls into ask yourself:</p><li> Are they asking unique questions that have not been asked before or just repeating others?</li><li> Are their topics genuinely original or are they carbon copies of various others&rsquo; work?</li><li> Do their ideas and insights challenge the status quo?</li><li> Are their followers interacting and engaging with valuable opinions and insights? <br/>  </li><p> If the answers to all of these questions is &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, then you have found yourself a true-blue influencer.</p><h3> Ingredient #4: Make it A Community Effort</h3><p> <br/> The best influencer marketing campaigns don&rsquo;t just utilize a handful of highly influential people to do all of the heavy lifting; no, they more complex than that and create layers of influencers to reach consumers on various levels.</p><p> While targeting the big players is still essential, it is important to not overlook those you will need to play a supporting role. When it comes to influencers, there are three different tiers to consider, all of which play a vital role in your campaign.</p><p> Tier one influencers are the big boys; these folks have hundreds of thousands or even millions of followers who can push out messages even to the deepest recesses of the internet. Tier two influencers have a smaller, more niche following than tier one, yet their subscribers are dedicated and faithful to this person&rsquo;s insights. Tier three influencer have a small audience typically consisting of less than 10,000 followers; these individuals are there to help supplement and strengthen the campaign&rsquo;s overall message.</p><p> By adding these various layers of depth to your campaign, you are sure to reach a much larger audience than sticking to a single tier of influencer.</p><h3> Ingredient #5: Build an Influential Relationship</h3><p> <br/> Now THIS is the real meat of your efforts; the heart and soul of your marketing campaign no matter your niche, influencers, audience, or anything else.</p><p> Building a relationship with the influencers you have located will help ensure a smooth and fruitful endeavor and will establish connections that will last long after the campaign has ended. Do be warned, however, this is the most difficult (and rewarding) part of the process.</p><p> Influencers are obviously highly sought-after individuals and are therefore absolutely swamped with comments, messages, emails, pitches, etc. To begin to build a truly meaningful relationship with these folks you need to learn to cut through all of that noise, so email won&rsquo;t be of much assistance here. The best avenue to reaching these people is through social media and their own personal websites.</p><p> You need to reach out by adding value to current conversations on their Twitter or Facebook feeds, blog posts, and anywhere else you can interject your two cents; granted your offer has value to them as well. Take conversations to new heights and in creative directions to really get people&rsquo;s attention. Engage with their following as well. Show that you are not just interested in the influencer, but you are interested in the growth and well-being of their network. Once you have taken these steps and gained some attention, reach out with your pitch; you stand a greater chance of recruiting them for your cause.</p><p> Do keep in mind, however, that when you reach out it is paramount to display what you can do for the influencer instead of focusing on what they can offer your campaign. Again, this make you more likely of gaining a partner in your mission. Think about things that might be of value to the influencer that you can offer such as extending their own personal reach, getting them published in prominent and acclaimed publications, generous monetary compensation, or products that will be beneficial in their careers. You want to really get an influencers attention? Show them you genuinely want to help them grow just as much as they will help you grow.</p><p> If you do enlist the folks you connect with, your relationship-building efforts will carry on all throughout the campaign. When it comes to managing the campaign and all of the details that involve the influencers, you will want to make things as smooth and easy as possible for these people. Send emails that provide all of the pertinent details while making as few requests as possible. Ensure that you make good on your promises and always verify that these folks have all the information they need to succeed.</p><p> Even after the campaign has ended, reach out to confirm that they had a pleasant experience, if there is something you can help with, and see if they feel there is anything you can improve upon for the next time around.</p><p> Influencer marketing can be an unparalleled tool in the digital environment if it is managed correctly. And again, while there is no set formula or universal solution to this method, there is a foundation and common elements of all highly successful influencer marketing campaigns.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-17 18:42:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-17 18:42:47.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_HOsh6yH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-sauce-to-influencer-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"8640\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-17 18:42:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-17 18:42:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-sauce-to-influencer-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8639\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4092\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Secret-Sauce-to-Influencer-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"601\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453110300,"author_id":484,"chart_url":""}

Can we simply recognize that no organization or industry is exempt from &ldquo;constant change&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> If we assume change is a constant, then is our best course of action determining best practices for using change to improve our organizations, become more responsive, agile and resilient while ensuring we target investments to transform our organization ahead of the curve, and attain competitive advantage?</p><h3> Savvy Investments</h3><p> <br/> Per KPMG in their recently released research series,  <u>  <a href=\"https://advisory.kpmg.us/managementconsulting/issue/succeed-in-change-disruption-research-series.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Succeed in Constant Change  </a> </u> , the most profitable firms are 10% more likely to invest in industry technology innovation. The least profitable businesses more often invest in legacy technology.</p><p> Indeed, the most successful companies are investing in a combination of emerging industry technology and are either developing internally or engaging outside talent with the expertise to leverage advanced technology. Data, analytics and automation make up the most common technology investments. These technologies apply to numerous industries, but each industry has specialized applications. Those lacking the talent to fully utilize these technologies will find themselves left behind.</p><h3> Putting Investment Benefits to Work</h3><p> <br/> The investment in both technology and talent are commonly supporting three key areas:</p><h3> 1. Consumerization</h3><p> <br/> Today it&rsquo;s important to both recognize an individual consumer as a &ldquo;market of one,&rdquo; and, as with market segments, be engaged across multiple channels. This is when an automated back office, capable of helping the company make better decisions and ensure they are catering to individual customer needs proves its worth.</p><p> In addition, retaining top-notch talent by treating employees as individuals requires leaders who understand employee differences and create more personalized experiences.</p><h3> 2. Changing demographics and the democratization of technology</h3><p> <br/> Substantial demographic changes not only impact an organization&rsquo;s future customer base, but also its future talent base. Social, cultural and generational personal changes, along with new workforce characteristics pose a variety of complexities.</p><p> Accessibility to robust technologies, (e.g. cloud computing, social and mobile) is widespread among companies and consumers. Mobile purchase decisions take place in both personal and corporate situations.</p><h3> 3. Digitization of everything</h3><p> <br/> Beyond using technology to optimize the back office, progressive companies are investing in technologies to improve the front office as well. Changing customer expectations necessitate new ways of interacting with customers. Essentially, connectivity &ndash; AKA &ldquo;The Internet of Things&rdquo; &ndash; encompasses everything &ndash; people, processes, data and objects.</p><p> A company can strengthen the likelihood of success from their innovation initiatives through effective use of technology and talent. While true innovation has inherent risks, and won&rsquo;t be successful every time, leveraging superior technology and talent increases odds relative to companies that haven&rsquo;t built these capabilities.</p><h3> Action Items:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Given your industry, your current status on the continuum of lowest to highest use of advanced technology </strong> , and the level of talent currently within your organization, develop a plan to find ways to fund highly strategic acquisition of the technology and talent that will complement what you have today and bring your organization forward as quickly as possible. This may need to be a phased plan, and it will likely incorporate staffing changes. Ensure you have the best talent leading the charge in determining what technology and what skill sets are needed to use new technologies to greatest advantage.</p><p> <strong>  2. Create methods to benchmark your organization &ndash; or better yet &ndash; future mark your organization against those organizations you and your leadership team consider best-in-class. </strong> Track your progress at least quarterly, and make adjustments as needed.</p><p> <strong>  3. Test your organization&rsquo;s ability to meet the needs of a &ldquo;market of one&rdquo; and across all relevant channels. </strong> Set goals and track your progress &ndash; remembering to factor in constant change in customer expectations and innovations across channels.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-17 19:05:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-17 19:05:57.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_s5JjaXb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/change-embrace-it-learn-from-it-use-it-to-achieve-competitive-advantage/\", \"post_id\": \"8641\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-17 19:05:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-17 19:05:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"change-embrace-it-learn-from-it-use-it-to-achieve-competitive-advantage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8639\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4093\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Secret-Sauce-to-Influencer-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"445\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453148100,"author_id":464,"chart_url":""}

Give yourself the time and space you need.</p><h3> 2. That moments of calm will last.</h3><p> They will not. They may linger longer as time progresses. Remember that divorce and feelings of calm do not go hand in hand &ndash; but also remember that this doesn&rsquo;t mean that feeling calm and centered will not occur. They will, but with a lot of fits and starts.</p><h3> 3. That the decisions you made today will stay with you and carry you through.</h3><p> Making decisions is a continual reassessment process. You will have to reaffirm your decisions for yourself time and time again. Things change. Circumstances change. People change.</p><h3> 4. Your friends will always be your friends.</h3><p> We would like to believe (and hope) this is true, but it doesn&rsquo;t always work out that way. Sometimes friends remain friends with the ex-spouse and sometimes with you. It just depends. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to remain friends with someone who&rsquo;s in the midst of a divorce due to divorce contagion! The fear that being close to someone who is divorcing might cause their marriage to crumble and possibly end in divorce. Many unhappy married people are frightened that their friend&rsquo;s divorce may bring their marital issues into the spotlight (because sometimes it does!). And, they don&rsquo;t want them around your spouse, giving them ideas or possibly &ndash; gulp &ndash; the courage to leave their marriage.</p><p> Remember that relationships will change. Some should. Many times the invitations for the couples&rsquo; events will stop arriving and you will find yourself having to create new relationships with other single people or couples who enjoy having single friends!</p><h3> 5. Listening to others will help you make the right decision.</h3><p> Many people will turn to their friends and family to help them make the right decision during a divorce. Because everyone has their own life experiences, their views will be based on and sometimes biased because of them.  Although friends and family do provide a lot of support, people can often miss listening to their &lsquo;inner voice&rsquo; and will not make their own decision based on their particular situation. This is the tricky part; you have to find the balance between getting the support you need and want and making decisions that will be good for you and your family.</p><h3> Remember, divorce &ndash; like marriage and other major life transitions &ndash; takes time. It is a journey &ndash; a journey of your own.</h3>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 16:01:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 16:01:29.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_LNCJARy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-things-not-to-expect-while-going-through-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"8642\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 16:01:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 16:01:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-things-not-to-expect-while-going-through-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8639\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4094\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Secret-Sauce-to-Influencer-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"529\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453222800,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3949,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How You Actually \"Catch\" an Opportunity","link":"how-you-actually-catch-an-opportunity","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> 2016 is still fresh, but can already applaud the release of a very interesting study on entrepreneurial decision-making.</h3><p> <br/> The professors Kathleen Randerson, Jean-Michel Degeorge, and Alain Fayolle identified what factors influence the decision to run with an opportunity or not.</p><p> Assessing an opportunity is a process with different starting points, phases, and directions. Some opportunities are made and others are found. Parts of the process are rational and others are intuitive. And sometimes the process is goal oriented and normative (what you ought to do to achieve your goal) while at other times it is non-predictive (what you can create from what you have). All those differences play a role in how you identify and act on an opportunity.</p><h3> <strong>  Intuition </strong></h3><p> <br/> To identify an opportunity, you notice and assess information using a frame of reference you&rsquo;ve obtained in the past. You are continuously shaping and confirming ideas about opportunities when you recognize and interpret changes in the company environment. The frame of reference is also shaped  by your knowledge and experience. When you&rsquo;re using your intuition, you are activating that framework in your mind.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to recognize your preference for either analytical or intuitive reasoning because that influences what information you actually see. When you&rsquo;re an intuitive entrepreneur, you tend to give more consideration to the intuitive parts of the assessment process and be distracted during the analytical parts. And when you&rsquo;re more inclined to use rational analysis, then you&rsquo;re focused on that. Neither approach is better than the other, but decision-making quality increases when you&rsquo;re aware of and act on your blind spots.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re in intuitive mode, you tend to have little patience with details, you dislike routine, and you reach conclusions quickly. But when you&rsquo;re in analytical mode, you want to evaluate alternatives deliberately and logically. When you acknowledge the modus you&rsquo;re in, you know you have to give some extra thought to the rest of the process.</p> Two approaches to act on opportunities (source: Randerson et al 2016) <h3> <br/> <strong>  The Power to Create Growth </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the majority of the Business Schools and in the minds of traditional managers, strategy is seen as a causal process. You use analysis and estimations to set a goal and to determine the take steps to reach it. When your company does X, the result will be Z.</p><p> However, when you innovate or want to create new markets, data is lacking and analysis and estimations won&rsquo;t get you far. In those situations, growth depends on you instead of an opportunity. You use your imagination to envision and develop new combinations of the means you have available. You control the means X and Y, and you think you can connect them differently to create a new product-market combination.</p><h3> <strong>  It&rsquo;s All About the Situation </strong></h3><p> <br/> Both approaches are not mutually exclusive. You switch between them continuously, depending on your situation. The size of your company, the industry you&rsquo;re in, and the position the company has in the industry determine the process.</p><p> For instance, very small companies hardly have any means and those entrepreneurs tend to work more intuitively and less causal. (Unless they&rsquo;re in, for example, high-tech because then they favor causal logic). Larger companies are more bureaucratic and have the means and competencies to use analysis.</p><p> Another reason to favor causal logic is the extent to which your firm depends on others. Subcontractors, for instance, feel the need to dissect information and weigh alternatives deliberately while suppliers at the start of the chain often assess opportunities more intuitively.</p><h3> <strong>  Good News </strong></h3><p> <br/> Remarkably, the assessment process is not very dependent on personality. That means that entrepreneurs and managers can learn to use both approaches well. Now that you know, you have the good fortune to add a tool for seeing and deciding on opportunities.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 16:27:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 16:27:16.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_cQMYPwe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-you-actually-catch-an-opportunity/\", \"post_id\": \"8645\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 16:27:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 16:27:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-you-actually-catch-an-opportunity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8643\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4096\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/I\\u2019m-Silently-Correcting-Your-Client-Service.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1088\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453201200,"author_id":52,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3950,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Observation of Great Leaders Paves the Way","link":"observation-of-great-leaders-paves-the-way","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hiverhq\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Niraj Ranjan Rout  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://hiverhq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Hiver  </u> </a></p><p> Military leaders like Julius Caesar have led their legions to victory time and again. Not only have they been victorious in battles through brilliant strategy, but these leaders have redefined the meaning of leadership from an archaical definition like monarchy and aristocracy to a modern definition which we follow in our business and corporate world.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are a few lessons I learnt from the great men like Julius Caesar. </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1.  Always put yourself first in the line of fire.</h3><p> <br/> You must have had that team leader, who, once promoted to Team Manager starts dumping all the unpleasant and risk prone tasks on to you and a lot of times even blames! Don&rsquo;t learn by that example.</p><p> Walking willingly into a problem is one of the key parts of the responsibility a leader holds.</p><p> Caesar always took accountability for the failures, instead of shifting the blame onto someone else. When something goes wrong you must make sure that your client is looking to you, rather than your team member/employee.</p><p> At Hiver, if for example there is a lapse in service, I make sure to get on the email thread and resolve the issue for the client, instead of sitting back and letting my employees bear the brunt.</p><p> This article gives you  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/penny-herscher/5-reasons-to-put-yourself-in-the-line-of-fire-as-a-leader.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   five noteworthy reasons  </a> </u>  to put yourself in the line of fire.</p><p> <strong>  Takeaway: </strong>  A great business leader voluntarily steps in to shoulder the unpleasant tasks and lifts that burden of their subordinates.</p><h3> 2. Action should be the only way to preach.</h3><p> <br/> The oldest lesson in the book, and yet the most powerful one.</p><p> Leaders like Caesar were men who didn&rsquo;t abuse their power by skulking backstage and coming forward to just enjoy the spoils of victories. They stood in the forefront of the battles and faced every challenge, problem and failure head on , along with their men.</p><p> One simple example, if you expect your team members to work on an issue after work hours and you get ready to go home on the dot, I am pretty sure that they will see you as a tyrant and not as a leader!</p><p> <strong>  Takeaway: </strong> True leaders set standards for everyone by setting standards for themselves first.</p><p> Business leaders too, should embody this.</p><h3> 3. Strategy, and not skills, brings wins.</h3><p> <br/> Caesar knew that using a short dagger (gladius) against long heavy swords will slow his enemies down &ndash; is the right battle strategy.</p><p> And during his reign he proves over and over again that to win you need strategy and innovation. A fact that famous business leaders and thinkers stand by today.</p><p> Steve Jobs too, knew that the only way he could create differentiation for Apple is by out-looking the chunky, bulky containers they called computers back then. Now, Apple embodies both creativity and efficiency.</p><p> <strong>  Takeaway:  </strong> The only way you can have the maximum impact you are capable of is by using your skill with strategy.</p><h3> 4. Win the work force, not the board members.</h3><p> <br/> Many military leaders including Caesar and Napoleon became famous by winning over the masses and their soldiers, rather than the authorities. They worked towards building such strong relationships with their subordinates that people were gladly willing to do anything for them.</p><p> This kind of cherishing, is the difference between a leader and a great leader. The people&rsquo;s love is a strong asset for a leader.  <a href=\"http://storylineblog.com/2014/01/13/great-leaders-arent-afraid-to-love-their-teams/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Read this. </a></p><p> One of my favorite CEOs of all time, Herb Kelleher was an embodiment of this Ideal. He was often found working in the factories along with work force, even after becoming a CEO of a company like Southwestern Airlines.  <u>  <a href=\"http://hiverhq.com/blog/5-ways-your-startup-can-prevent-employee-burnout/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Taking care of your employees&rsquo; well-being  </a> </u>  should always be given paramount importance.</p><p> <strong>  Takeaway: </strong>  Managers and business leaders who are most respected by their team are also the ones most respected by the authorities.</p><h3> 5. Don&rsquo;t leave even the smallest of details to chance.</h3><p> <br/> If we are honest with ourselves, most of us have the tendency to go hard till 90% and leave the the remaining 10% to chance or &lsquo;HOPE that everything will workout&rsquo; ; Optimism is great but not without giving your best effort first.</p><p> Our historical heroes have proved that over and over again. Charismatic leader like Napoleon , even went to the extent of practicing his smiles everyday, to achieve that charismatic smile that can swoon people.</p><p> These leaders did everything they could to have the highest impact on their followers.</p><p> <strong>  Takeaway: </strong>  With so much advancement in technology, analytics and areas like risk management, it is much easier now than ever before to plan out every small detail and predict every possible outcome and ready yourself for it.</p><h3> 6. Careful self-promotion is good.</h3><p> <br/> It is true that Caesar refused the crown thrice, but he was no epitome of modesty. He resorted to self promotion whenever he could and strangely the mob didn&rsquo;t consider it as arrogance or vanity, but well-deserved fame and respect.</p><p> As a leader, sometimes it is important to appear larger than life and especially in the initial stages, when you are still proving yourself. It is not uncommon or bad to promote yourself a little here and there, just enough to prove your ability and not enough to come of as self-obsessed.</p><p> A book called promote yourself is an enlightening read on the same subject.</p><p> <strong>  Takeaway: </strong>  No one really knows who you are until you tell them. Careful and calculated self-promotion earns you respect.</p><h3> 7. Chose to expose rather than hide your vulnerabilities</h3><p> <br/> This is quite a counter-intuitive lesson, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> Managers and business leaders these days work so much towards portraying a level of outward perfection such as &lsquo;I donate half my salary to the poor&rsquo; or &lsquo;I believe in World Peace&rsquo; just because it is the perfect impression to give.</p><p> People always sense and detest fake perfection ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hating-Perfection-Subtle-Search-Possible/dp/1591027322\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   actually true perfection even  </a> </u> ). They want to know that you are human too and sharing your flaws helps you build a stronger relationship with them.</p><p> Caesar was an expert at that; he was often called the drama queen and he literally had a seizure on the stage, when he was offered the crown. This was considered by most of his peers as weakness, but not his people! They loved him for it.</p><p> <strong>  Takeaway: </strong>  A leader is not meant to be a symbol of perfection, but rather a symbol of compassion, trust and honesty.</p><p> Surely, there is no one consistent leadership lesson from the history or from the present. Some say impulsiveness in decision making causes failure, yet Richard Branson (known to be impulsive) is considered one of the most successful business leaders of this time. Having said that, I think it is important to draw on our past and present to understand the concept of leadership better, before we dive in.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 17:15:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 17:15:39.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_UWLAVUD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/observation-of-great-leaders-paves-the-way/\", \"post_id\": \"8647\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 17:15:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 17:15:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"observation-of-great-leaders-paves-the-way\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8646\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4097\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Observation-of-Great-Leaders-Paves-the-Way.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"969\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453234500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3951,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 MUSTS for Social Media in 2016","link":"3-musts-for-social-media-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Last year, I wrote  <u>  <a href=\"http://archdigitalagency.com/3-musts-for-social-media-in-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   3 MUSTS for Social Media in 2015  </a> </u>  because everyone writes a &ldquo;trends for the upcoming year&rdquo; post, but looking back &ndash; I really called it!</p><p> So why not continue the tradition this year?</p><p> Making predictions for an upcoming year is a tough call with social media because our industry trends shift so quickly, but I&rsquo;m convinced that even my 2015 predictions will continue to hold true this year.</p><p> Before we jump into 2016, here&rsquo;s a 2015 prediction review:</p><h3> 1. Personal Connection</h3><p> <br/> This was definitely a major key in constructing messages and curating content in 2015, and will continue to be this year.</p><p> In fact, we&rsquo;ll begin seeing personalization take on a whole new meaning as apps and tech create devices and services that match up with users. And as these products grow, so will the need for targeted promotions.</p><h3> 2. Video</h3><p> <br/> I was a bit ahead of this prediction last year &ndash; not in the world of marketing, but with business owners and brands.</p><p> They began engaging with video regularly in 2015, but hadn&rsquo;t allocated budget for it or sewn it into the content marketing strategies.</p><p> However, moving forward this year, brands small and large know that video will be a necessary part of every content marketing strategy.</p><h3> 3. Ad Spend</h3><p> <br/> Ad spend increased monumentally in 2015, but it&rsquo;s going to be the heaviest portion of budget in 2016.</p><p> With the death of most organic reach across social networks, and the inundation of ads, we&rsquo;re seeing more and more companies work harder and spend more to make their ads stand out.</p><p> We may even see interactive ads this year.</p><p> Now, let&rsquo;s cover the 3 MUSTS for Social Media in 2016.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Rawness (Philosophy) </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve fallen madly in love with raw content. And although it&rsquo;s not called that in the marketing community, it&rsquo;s how I describe this specific type of content.</p><p> For example, it&rsquo;s the content we&rsquo;re seeing on Snapchat these days. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;in the moment,&rdquo; not prettied up, and shrouded in humanness. It&rsquo;s content that endears us to someone or some brand because it seems so &ldquo;off the cuff&rdquo; and vulnerable.</p><p> It&rsquo;s humanization at its best!</p><p> And I know it&rsquo;s the main reason Snapchat is blowing up at its current rate. In October 2015, 2 million messages were opened everyday on Snapchat. And by December 2015, that number skyrocketed to 2 BILLION!</p><p> If marketers and business folks alike aren&rsquo;t taking Snapchat seriously, it&rsquo;s TIME. If for no other reason than it&rsquo;s going to help you understand the shift in social media that&rsquo;s occurring right now.</p><p> Besides the raw content, a major feature is the ability to share video messages so easily. You can&rsquo;t get more personal than that. And again, they&rsquo;re raw &ndash; shot in the moment, not constructed in a studio with beautiful lighting.</p><p> How does this translate to your social media strategy for 2016?</p><p> <strong>  What to do: </strong></p><li> Start investing your time on social networks that organically share more raw content, like Snapchat, Periscope or Blab. And take a good look at how you can use that content to share across other networks.</li><li> Stop allowing your perfectionism to keep you from creating content &ndash; believe me, the audience will like you for who you are. And you will attract the right audience because you won&rsquo;t be trying to be like someone or some thing else.</li><li> Be vulnerable in what you share. Don&rsquo;t go overboard and be a sob fest or so hyper than people will question your credibility. But allow your true life to shine through what you share online.</li><li> Figure it out as you go along. Don&rsquo;t waste time feeling like you have to buy the right gear or have the best set up, just do it! And grow by increments. Everyone started somewhere.</li><li> Spend lots of time viewing raw content. Go ahead, get out there and see what I mean. Watch what other people and brands are doing because it will help you in your own quest. Inspiration is a powerful tool. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  2. Mix it up (Content) </strong></h3><p> <br/> When I say &ldquo;mix it up,&rdquo; I literally mean throw every kind of content and anything fun you can do with it into one bowl, and start getting creative.</p><p> Examples are Boomerang or Phhhoto videos, GIFs, quote photos with music in the background, still ads that have one moving part.</p><p> My point is that the content we share is going to have take a few steps up.</p><p> Our audiences aren&rsquo;t going to be dazzled with the same quote cards or simple blogs anymore. Some will, most won&rsquo;t.</p><p> As online audiences get more smashed up with content everywhere they go, it&rsquo;s our job to make sure whatever content we&rsquo;re producing is top notch. And not that it hasn&rsquo;t always been this way.</p><p> But I mean a few steps above that. In addition, brands and businesses must start producing more content to keep up and get their message out there. That means writing more, making more videos, and utilizing photos every other time versus every few times.</p><p> Visual content is what&rsquo;s HOT! And it shows no time of slowing down.</p><p> <strong>  What to do: </strong></p><li> Start being creative with your content and think of ways to make blogs more interactive, photos more stimulating, and videos more fun and educational.</li><li> Combine medias in one piece of content, ex. photos and music.</li><li> Get colorful with your content &ndash; don&rsquo;t stick to the same old colors.</li><li> Utilize content you post on other networks and repackage it for use on a new one, ex. Snapchat stories work fantastic across networks.</li><li> Hire content creators to handle this for you if it sounds too intense. If you&rsquo;re a business owner, there&rsquo;s better things you could be spending your time on. Let the professionals handle it. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  3. Social network downsizing (Technical) </strong></h3><p> <br/> In 2016, brands and individuals alike will start downsizing the social networks they use on a regular basis.</p><p> Why? Because it&rsquo;s becoming too much. Also, because most brands have been marketing online for a few years now, and are seeing where they&rsquo;re getting the best returns.</p><p> Social media success doesn&rsquo;t come overnight, so it&rsquo;s taken a few years to start seeing where to ween off, but it will definitely start happening this year.</p><p> In terms of the consumer, people are getting frantic with their time. They see themselves spending more and more time online, hanging out, and other areas of their life are beginning to suffer.</p><p> This year, we read studies that say Facebook breaks apart marriages, destroys self-esteem, and Instagram lends itself to unhealthy body images. People talk about how irritated they get when family or friends spend all their time online when they should be spending time together. And when asked, we all tend to agree that we&rsquo;re spending too much time on social media.</p><p> Two brand new social networks have popped onto the scene and it&rsquo;s barely mid-January.</p><p> So as we proceed forward in 2016, we&rsquo;re going to see more folks backsliding into the places they consider most useful for business and interactions. And negating the rest.</p><p> <strong>  What to do: </strong></p><li> Take note of which social networks are working best for your business or personal brand, and figure out where to cut back.</li><li> Take special note of online audience behaviors. Just because a particular network is killing it for you now, doesn&rsquo;t mean it will by the end of this year.</li><li> Continue building your email list. It&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/this-is-why-email-marketing-is-still-key/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   still the best investment you can make in marketing  </a> </u> .</li><li> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to test wildly this year &ndash; cut back on posting, switch up your media, and test to see where your audiences are happiest.</li><li> Crowdsource your audience to find out where they plan on spending their time, and what is most appealing to them. Nothing better than cutting through the questions to find out from the source! <br/>  </li><p> Now it&rsquo;s your turn! Agree/disagree? Share your thoughts with me.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 17:31:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 17:31:46.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_sHgZYBk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-musts-for-social-media-in-2016/\", \"post_id\": \"8649\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 17:31:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 17:31:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-musts-for-social-media-in-2016\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8648\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4098\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3-MUSTS-for-Social-Media-in-2016.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"511\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453226400,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}

You may have to postpone that fantasy of buying a private island in Thailand, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t still be on your way to achieving your financial goals and dreams.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s one way to do it &ndash; take that money you&rsquo;re sinking into Powerball tickets and invest it instead.</h3><p> <br/> Why are so many people willing to waste hundreds of dollars on a lottery they won&rsquo;t win instead of investing it in capital markets that have shown growth over time? Many reasons. For some people, the hardest part of saving and investing could be just getting started. For others, it&rsquo;s not understanding the benefits of compound interest and that even small amounts add up over time. For others it may be fear of volatility and distrust or the markets from listening to too much CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg!</p><p> While it&rsquo;s true that markets have dipped significantly in January, market dips are a potential opportunity to buy low and earn higher returns over time. The bottom line is that, for most people, even those starting with modest amounts, keeping money in cash is generally  <u>  <a href=\"http://cramersshirt.weebly.com/blog/cash-is-king-in-your-401k\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not a winning proposition  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s why:</h3><p> <br/> Lets say you are contributing $250 each month ($3k/yr) to your 401k plan with a 100% company match and invest it in a diversified basket of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. At the same time, you save and invest $20 a week (the cost of 10 Powerball tickets a week) in a regular investment account. Assuming historical 4.8% annual returns*, here is how your money will grow over a 20-year period (in today&rsquo;s dollars) vs. saving the same amount as cash:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Picture1\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Picture1.png\"/> </a></p>*based on a diversified portfolio that assumes the following weights: 25% in the S&amp;P 500, 10% in the Russell 2000, 15% in the MSCI EAFE, 5% in the MSCI EME, 25% in the Barclays Aggregate, 5% in the Barclays 1-3m Treasury, 5% in the Barclays Global High Yield Index, 5% in the Bloomberg Commodity Index and 5% in the NA REIT Equity REIT Index. Balanced portfolio assumes annual rebalancing. All data represents total return for stated period. Past performance is not indicative of future returns. Data are as of 12/31/15. Annualized (Ann.) return and volatility (Vol.) represents period of 12/31/99 &ndash; 12/31/15.

But first speak with a financial advisor about your current situation and future goals and what the best steps are to start working towards financial freedom.</p><p> <strong>  And when the next Powerball comes around?

But the similarities stop there.</li><p> ETFs and mutual funds sometimes have significant differences in everything from fees and expenses, accessibility and minimum investments, to tax efficiency and trading costs. Both ETFs and mutual funds can be a viable part of an investor&rsquo;s strategy. Which is the better choice depends in large part on an investor&rsquo;s overall goals and approach to investing. To make informed decisions about which product can best meet their needs, investors should understand the key differences between ETFs and mutual funds. We've outlined some of the key differences in Exhibit 1. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-18-at-12.01.30-PM-2.png\" width=\"719\"/></p><h3> Investor Demand</h3><p> <br/> At nearly $16 trillion, assets in U.S. mutual funds dwarf those in ETFs, which were estimated at just under $2 trillion at the end of 2014. But investments in ETFs are growing at an accelerated pace while mutual funds are just recovering from major outflows during the peak years of the recent financial crisis. Increased awareness among retail investors and their advisers has played a definite role in ETF growth. In turn, ETF sponsors are beginning to offer more varied funds, including ETFs that invest in particular market sectors, industries or commodities, as well as actively managed ETFs. Simultaneously, the mutual fund industry is seeing growth in the popularity of index mutual funds, particularly those indexed to the S&amp;P 500 or other traditional domestic and international stock indexes. What do ETF and mutual fund investors look like demographically? As the table below shows, households that own ETFs have considerably higher income and financial assets than those that own mutual funds. They are also more highly educated with 64% having a four-year college degree or higher.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-18-at-12.01.22-PM-2.png\" width=\"718\"/></p><h3> It is interesting to note that ETF-owning households say they are more willing to accept greater investment risk for the possibility of higher return.</h3><p> <br/> Nearly half say they would take &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; or &ldquo;above-average&rdquo; risk for commensurate gains, as opposed to 31% of mutual funds owners and only 21% of all U.S. households. WHICH PRODUCT IS RIGHT FOR YOU? Selecting an investment depends on your unique goals, investment horizon and personal preference. A financial advisor can help you weigh the pros and cons of each option for your particular situation. Remember that both ETFs and mutual funds can help meet most investment objectives. Consider adding both to any portfolio to maximize exposure to different asset classes and investing strategies. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-18-at-12.04.01-PM-2.png\" width=\"340\"/></p><p> For more information please visit us at <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-etfs-vs-mutual-funds-post-32516\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Flex Shares  </u> </a> .</p>IMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURE An investment in FlexShares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested.

{"original_id":3954,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Ways to Be a Creative Entrepreneur","link":"10-ways-to-be-a-creative-entrepreneur","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenMoyers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stephen Moyers  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.spinxdigital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Spinx  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  A successful business may start with a remarkable idea, but it&rsquo;s sustained by hard work and a healthy dose of creativity. </strong> Effective entrepreneurs have the necessary knowledge, but they must also be adaptable and imaginative. The best have a balanced mix of several skills. Entrepreneurship takes ingenuity, perseverance, and most importantly, a little creativity.</p><p> Creativity is what gives you the tools to adapt to changing situations and come up with solutions to problems. It also gives you the inspiration to discover the new ideas that will fuel your business&rsquo; success. Luckily, creativity isn&rsquo;t just innate; it can be learned. Everyone has a creative side &ndash; the trick is learning how to grow and channel it. </p><h3> Embrace Your Curiosity</h3><p> <br/> Insatiable curiosity is one of the main features of a creative mind. Maybe you&rsquo;re always researching new ideas online, or maybe you love reading news and learning facts. Curiosity is how you take a concept that already exists and mold it into a new idea. It allows you to take what you know about something and expand upon it to create something original. And that&rsquo;s important to becoming a successful entrepreneur. The most effective businesses are unique or those that approach something known in a fresh way &ndash; and curiosity is the path that leads you there. So go ahead, embrace a curiosity and infuse your mind with new knowledge every day.</p><h3> Be Confident</h3><p> <br/> Confidence is another important aspect to channeling your creativity and becoming a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.spinxdigital.com/blog/what-the-beatles-can-teach-entrepreneurs-about-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   successful entrepreneur  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s what fuels your creative ideas and motivates you to follow through on them. It&rsquo;s easy to come up with a creative idea and immediately cast it off as a dud, but confidence will give you the power to bring that idea to fruition. You need to be confident in your ability to solve a particular problem. With immense confidence, you can face difficult challenges head-on and come out on top. </p><h3> A Little Bit of Illogicalness </h3><p> <br/> Conventional wisdom has its place: we follow it because we know it works. But sometimes, taking the less common path breeds unique solutions and new ideas. Looking at things from an unconventional perspective will open up a new realm of possibilities. By thinking about things differently, you&rsquo;re expanding your mind and welcoming creativity. So next time you&rsquo;re faced with a problem, don&rsquo;t be afraid to take the road less (or never) traveled. You may just find something truly special and unique. </p><h3> Tap Into Your Resourceful Side</h3><p> <br/> Resourcefulness is one of the best qualities of a creative mind. In fact, creativity and resourcefulness tend to go hand in hand. In the early stages of a start-up business, it&rsquo;ll allow your company to blossom without outgrowing your budget. As your business grows and changes, it will keep you grounded in reality and work as a focusing point. Whether you&rsquo;re starting a company out of your garage or can&rsquo;t secure a loan for start-up costs, being resourceful will help you find other ways to get your operations off the ground and running. Think creatively and research alternative solutions, and you may find the answer. </p><h3> Learn to Visualize</h3><p> <br/> Visualization is a stone in the foundation to creativity and successful entrepreneurship. The ability to visualize other outcomes and pathways opens your mind creatively and helps instill confidence in your choices. Some of the most creative professions rely on the power of visualization. For example, game designers and writers must be able to visualize an entire world, complete with characters, scenery, and situations.</p><p> As an entrepreneur, this ability will help you imagine new ideas and how they can be realized. How will your new product or service affect people? What does the packaging look like? Who&rsquo;s your ideal customer? These are the questions visualization will answer. Once you have those answers, you&rsquo;ll have a more thorough understanding of your business and customers. </p><h3> Exercises to Grow Your Newfound Creativity</h3><p> <br/> Creativity doesn&rsquo;t just come from within; it needs to be nurtured in order to bloom. Once you&rsquo;ve tapped into your creative side,  <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/team-building-creativity.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  there are some exercises </a>  you can do to strengthen and grow it. These will help you develop the previously mentioned concepts. </p><p> <strong>  Exercise 1: The Alternative Reality Game   </strong></p><p> Think about a recent, familiar situation, and try to visualize alternative outcomes. Or start with a common occurrence and try to come up with a different way of looking at it. For example, when you go to a movie theater, you expect to see a particular movie and buy snacks and drinks in the lobby. But what if the movie you saw was a surprise? Or what if you brought your own food and drink, or had waitress service while watching the movie? Thinking of alternative &ldquo;realities&rdquo; will strengthen your power of visualization, which will help you to come up with unique ideas. </p><p> <strong>  Exercise 2: Finding Ways to Break the Rules </strong></p><p> Thinking unconventionally is one of the driving factors of a creative mind. It fuels originality and allows you to become more adaptable. To learn how to think unconventionally, you have to be okay with breaking the rules sometimes. This doesn&rsquo;t mean to go out there and start running red lights, but rather breaking down harmless conventional norms.</p><p> Perhaps you&rsquo;ll take the unknown back roads to work one day instead of the highway or offer to help the cart wrangler at the grocery store gather wayward buggies. Doing little out of the ordinary things unexpectedly will free your creativity. Even just thinking about different ways to break the rules will begin to open your mind. Your brain will be forced to think outside the box, and you&rsquo;ll gain the confidence you need to pursue new creative endeavors. </p><p> <strong>  Exercise 3: Childhood Hobbies as Inspiration </strong></p><p> Children are naturally creative. You see it in school projects, imaginary games, and the strange things kids say. Thus, one of the best ways to exercise your creativity is to revisit your childhood.</p><p> What did you love when you were a kid? What made you happiest? Did you love to build forts or climb trees? Did you love creating stories with your dolls or making clothes for them? Make a list of the things you did as a kid, and look for ways to tie them into your present business. You may come up with a new product or service you enjoy. Even if you don&rsquo;t come up with any new ideas, you&rsquo;ll still be embracing your creative mind by remembering your childhood and the things you loved to do. </p><p> <strong>  Exercise 4: Practicing Resourcefulness </strong></p><p> Flex your creative muscles by coming up with alternative solutions to problems. Make a list of problems you&rsquo;re facing and practice brainstorming alternative solutions and resources. Perhaps you&rsquo;re having trouble securing a loan for start-up costs. Make a list of alternatives: crowd funding, selling something you own, finding grants, or offering sample products for a donation.</p><p> Research every possible avenue as much as possible. You&rsquo;ll learn something new, and you may find the perfect answer to your problem. By learning how to be resourceful, you&rsquo;re training your brain to think creatively while laying the foundation to a successful business.</p><p> <strong>  Exercise 5: Bring It All Together With a Creativity Board </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"Creativity Board\" src=\"http://www.spinxdigital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Vision-Board.jpg\"/></p><p> Image:  <u>  <a href=\"http://hubpages.com/health/Createavisionboardofyourdreamsandgoals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hubpages  </a> </u></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://hubpages.com/health/Createavisionboardofyourdreamsandgoals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A creativity board  </a> </u>  will help you tie all your creative skills together. Start with a small idea for your business and a piece of poster board. Make a collage featuring anything that inspires your idea: images, articles, quotes, data &ndash; whatever speaks to you. Maybe it&rsquo;s a picture in a magazine with a fantastic color palette, or maybe it&rsquo;s a statistical analysis of your product&rsquo;s market. If it relates to your idea and is helpful, stick it on the board.</p><p> This exercise is excellent for inspiring creativity because it channels the power of association and helps to organize the ideas floating around in your mind. It also helps to create a concrete example of the vision you have for your business. Lastly, it instills confidence in your business idea and gives you a foundation for a plan.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 20:39:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 20:39:50.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ZzQ40Eh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-ways-to-be-a-creative-entrepreneur/\", \"post_id\": \"8657\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 20:39:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 20:39:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-ways-to-be-a-creative-entrepreneur\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8658\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4104\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10-Ways-to-Be-a-Creative-Entrepreneur.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"739\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453230000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3955,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Change Starts with Awareness, Yet it's Acceptance that Defines Your Future","link":"change-starts-with-awareness-yet-its-acceptance-that-defines-your-future","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Advisors often think of &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; as a means of settling for less. Actually it can be quite empowering.</h3><p> <br/> Psychologist Nathaniel Branden said, &ldquo;The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.&rdquo; I think about this simple line every time I talk with an advisor who speaks of endless frustration with his firm. As I say to everyone I counsel: Our happiness grows in direct proportion to our ability to accept a situation for what it is, and our understanding that there is a way through any situation.</p><p> That way comes down to a very basic decision: Accept your situation for what it is and choose to STAY the course, or accept your situation for what it is and decide there are greener pastures and&hellip;GO!</p><h3> Acceptance looks like a passive state&mdash;a giving up of sorts.</h3><p> <br/> But, I actually see acceptance as the most powerful stance in the world. Acceptance says, &ldquo;I recognize that this is my reality and I am in charge of how I want to live my life. It is within my power and purview to impact my life and if I accept my circumstances as they are, I am actively choosing to do so.&rdquo; It is the difference between active participation in life and being a doormat that brings us peace of mind and gratitude for even the most imperfect situation.</p><p> Joanne is a great example of an advisor who made the decision to stay with her firm after many months of due diligence with other firms and models. She came to me about a year ago saying that she had just finished her best year yet as an advisor, managing more than $500mm in client assets and generating $3.5mm in annual revenue. But, she was feeling unappreciated by senior management, very limited in the things she was able to do to customize her client service offering, and incredibly irritated by growing bureaucracy. When all was said and done &ndash; while the transition money being offered to her by competitor firms was hard to pass up and there were some very tangible improvements that she would have been afforded had she chosen to make the move &ndash; Joanne said, &ldquo;On par, my firm continues to serve me, and the good outweighs the bad. Overall, it allows me to make a very nice living, to serve my clients with integrity, and to grow my business as I believe I should. The ease of staying put outweighs the hassle of making a move.&rdquo; As a result of putting the notion of changing firms to rest and freeing herself from the persistent question of &ldquo;Should I stay or should I go?&rdquo;, she actually accepted the imperfections for what they were &ndash; minor annoyances &ndash; and empowered herself to be even more successful going forward.</p><p> Ted came to a different conclusion after a similar compare and contrast exercise. His $2B book of business was growing exponentially and while he was more than able to do what he needed to do for his clients, he had an unrelenting sense that he could grow even faster and more efficiently if he were given more freedom, flexibility and control. Like Joanne &ndash; the transition money being offered him by competing firms was enormous and hard to ignore &ndash; he believed that a move to another major firm would not move the needle enough. So instead he decided to go independent. Although a bit scary, lots of unknowns, and unfamiliar, Ted felt that his entrepreneurial DNA would never allow him to work as an employee again. He left his firm 6 months ago with absolutely no resentment or bad feelings toward it. Ted actually feels incredibly grateful to his old firm for enabling him to build the business he did and accepting of the reality that while running his business there was more than good enough up until now, it no longer served him. He feels empowered, emboldened and excited about his future.</p><p> After much due diligence and soul searching, Joanne and Ted came to very different conclusions in the end, but they share common ground: The awareness and acknowledgment of imperfection, the strength and willingness to do something about it, and the wisdom to actively choose the path that best fit them.</p><h3> Going through your day with blinders on &ndash; while may seem like acceptance &ndash; is simply a choice to ignore what&rsquo;s going on around you.</h3><p> <br/> Becoming aware of what&rsquo;s working for you and what&rsquo;s not, will allow you to either accept your current situation with greater empowerment, or propel you to seek another path. Either way, the choice is yours.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 20:47:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 20:47:29.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_VuiQ87l.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/change-starts-with-awareness-yet-its-acceptance-that-defines-your-future/\", \"post_id\": \"8659\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 20:47:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 20:47:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"change-starts-with-awareness-yet-its-acceptance-that-defines-your-future\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8660\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4105\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Change-Starts-with-Awareness-Yet-it\\u2019s-Acceptance-that-Defines-Your-Future.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1113\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453200300,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3956,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Email is the King of Financial Advisor Marketing","link":"why-email-is-the-king-of-financial-advisor-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blueleafadvisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Phil Rogers  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.blueleaf.com/advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blueleaf  </u> </a></p><h3> Financial advisor marketing is hard. There are endless options but which strategies work?</h3><p> <br/> The answer is simple. Focus on email for the best return on investment.</p><p> Email might seem old-fashioned, but it still works better than any other channel. Just why is that?</p><h3> Email is personal</h3><p> <br/> While there is a lot of buzz around social media, email remains the most personal medium. The inbox is home turf made even more available with smartphones. The email content needs to be personal and relevant to build trust.</p><h3> Email gets the best return on your time</h3><p> <br/> The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) found that  <u>  <a href=\"http://thedma.org/news/dma-releases-2013-statistical-fact-book/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   email marketing delivers a return of 4,300%  </a> </u> . The combination of low time investment and good results is very compelling. The increased availability of low-cost email automation makes the email opportunity, even more, compelling.</p><p> Effective email content builds a relationship with your audience through intriguing subject lines (getting your messages opened), a distinctive voice ( a personality that encourage reading and action), and quality, relevant content. The right content encourages sharing and referrals.</p><h3> Email is the most natural fit with the traditional financial advisor marketing model built around referrals.</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s how to get the most from email marketing. </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Build relationships faster with a better email strategy</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  A. 12 touches a year isn&rsquo;t going to cut it </strong></p><p> A recent Morningstar study asked how their clients prefer to be emailed. The survey found that 30.4% of clients prefer weekly emails from their advisor with 36.6% preferring to receive them monthly. Only 19.9% prefer emails quarterly and a mere 9.4% prefer them annually. The research is clear. Clients want to be emailed, and often.</p><p> Blueleaf&rsquo;s own behavioral data shows that over 60% of clients will open and read a relevant weekly email about their situation and almost 90% will open that same email once per month.</p><p> In fact, we&rsquo;ve found that advisors who are the most successful in growing their business will email their clients even MORE than once per week.</p><p> We spoke with Jason Wenk, Founder and President of  <u>  <a href=\"http://retirementwealthadvisors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Retirement Wealth Advisors  </a> </u> . His firm is growing 50% per year. Jason reported  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.blueleaf.com/the-answer-to-delivering-exceptional-service-on-a-national-scale-one-advisors-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reaching out to each client at least 150-200 times per year  </a> </u> . This translates into a minimum of 12.5 touches per month, 4 of which are handled automatically with his weekly Blueleaf email.</p><p> <a href=\"https://blog.blueleaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/weekly-email.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Blueleaf weekly email\" src=\"https://blog.blueleaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/weekly-email.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  B. Deliver value with every communication </strong></p><p> Remember that a touch can be delivered in various ways: in person, via email, phone, social media, or traditional mail. By mixing push and pull methods like email and blogging consume what they like and happily skip the rest. This kind of frequent contact powerfully reminds clients of your value even if some of the content is &ldquo;ignored&rdquo; by some clients.</p><p> The more clients feel you&rsquo;re delivering value to them, the more likely they will want to share that value. Continually delivering value also means more loyalty. Once you&rsquo;ve invested in a client relationship, you have to protect your investment if you want to prosper in the long run.</p><h3> 2. Create a Communication Calendar</h3><p> <br/> A Communication Calendar lets you plan out the types of content you want to send each month, so when a new month arrives, you&rsquo;re ready with a plan.</p><p> Click on  <u>  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o9uBA3i7-QDN5S7eNJlA7kDP1O4e90ZJCZ4rsM3dYDg/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">   this link  </a> </u>  and then copy the file to get your own version of our Content Calendar in Google Docs.</p><p> Your content should address the top issues that your clients and prospects have. Their biggest concerns are usually around maintaining their lifestyle in retirement and supporting their family. Developing your content should be based on client priorities not your own.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://personapp.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   free Persona App  </a> </u>  tool can help you with the questions to ask.</p><p> You can validate your research by checking keyword search volume in Google&rsquo;s free keyword planner. You have to sign up for an  <u>  <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/um/Signup/Home\" target=\"_blank\">   Adwords account to access it  </a> </u> . Here&rsquo;s a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/university/how-to-use-google-keyword-planning-tool/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   video to show you how to use the Keyword Planner tool  </a> </u> .</p><p> You can also check how the topic is trending using  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Trends  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 3. Optimize your emails</h3><p> <br/> Effective email has the following attributes.</p><p> <strong>  A. Personalized </strong></p><p> We don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;Hi [INSERT NAME HERE]&rdquo;. Forced familiarity can be counterproductive. Even with clients, personalization with their name will not get you far.</p><p> Personalization is most effective when you are used in a meaningful way. Blueleaf&rsquo;s weekly emails are powerful in this regard since they provide a real-time summary of the client&rsquo;s current financial picture. This is a big factor in the remarkably high engagement that these emails get.</p><p> Using research to make sure that your content addresses your client&rsquo;s big issues can generate high engagement levels also.</p><p> <strong>  B. Segmented </strong></p><p> Related to personalization, most email programs allow you to segment your lists based on specific criteria. At a minimum, segment your lists between clients and prospects. This gives you an opportunity to focus on generating referrals from your clients while seeking different engagement options like social follows with prospects.</p><p> <strong>  C. Subject line </strong></p><p> Research shows short subject lines (70 characters) get the highest open rate. Driving Opens means that you are trying to increase awareness of your content. In other words, you want them to read the email. Focusing on clicks is about generating a response or action such as visiting your blog. The success of the Obama campaign&rsquo;s legendary &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; subject line makes super short subject lines worth a test.</p><p> <strong>  D. When to send </strong></p><p> Research shows that emails sent in the morning will have slightly higher open rates. So mornings are a good time to send out something short, like an invitation to an event that people can scan as they prepare for their day.</p><p> The late afternoon has been shown to have a higher click through rate, which means this is a good time to send out a survey or teaser for a new blog post.</p><p> The idea is to think about your client&rsquo; s day and tailor what you send and when you send it to achieve optimal open and click through rates. Your persona research will help with this.</p><p> <strong>  E. Straight forward copy </strong></p><p> A simple, attention-grabbing and likable message increases response and click through. An eye-catching call-to-action with a &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it for me&rdquo; message is a key element. The recipient should know exactly what they are going to get when they click.</p><p> Try running your copy through  <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hemingway Editor </a>  to help you simplify. Just copy your text into the web editor and the application will highlight issues.</p><p> <strong>  F. Ask a question </strong></p><p> When you read a question in a marketing message, do you always think of an answer? Probably not. But a question still registers on a subconscious level and creates engagement. For example, you could start an email by saying, &ldquo;Wondering if you&rsquo;ll ever be able to retire?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Worried about the rising cost of education?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Should you buy or rent?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  G. Use other people&rsquo;s content </strong></p><p> No one expects you to write like a Pulitzer Prize Winner. You&rsquo;re an advisor who advises; let the writers write. As long as you give an author credit, feel free to summarize an article and link to it rather than write everything from scratch. Your clients will appreciate you sending them a helpful article and be happy that you spend most of your time managing their money.</p><p> <strong>  H. Measure the results </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;ve spent time and energy planning and running this nurturing campaign, so be sure to measure the responses you get! Watch how many clients open the email (effect of subject line or time you send it) and how many of them click on links (effect of your messaging or the content&rsquo;s relevance to their individual situation). Again, a lot of this results tracking and reporting is built into the email tools mentioned above.</p><h3> 4. Check out this email example</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  A. From line: John at Blueleaf (john@blueleaf.com) </strong></p><p> Try to avoid sending emails from a generic company email address (ex: info@advisor.com). The person or company an email comes from should be relevant to the person receiving it. When they recognize your name and company, they&rsquo;ll be much more likely to open the email.</p><p> <strong>  B. Subject line: A Step by Step Guide to &hellip; </strong></p><p> For example, a standard subject line may be: &ldquo;Quarterly Newsletter&rdquo;. A better subject line is &ldquo;Advisor X&rsquo;s Q3 Insights for the Aggressive Investor&rdquo;. Word to the wise: There is such a thing as being too compelling, though, so be careful.</p><p> <strong>  C. Sample email </strong></p><p> Subject Line: Top 5 Money Mistakes College Kids Make</p><p> ************************ <br/> Hi Bob and Ann, <br/> How are you enjoying this beautiful summer weather? I recently got back September approaching and students preparing to head back to college, I thought it&rsquo;d be a great time to share this helpful article:</p><p> &ldquo;Top 5 Money Mistakes College Students Make&rdquo;</p><p> QJ <br/> Best, <br/> Your Advisor</p><p> Think that this could be helpful people that you know?</p><p> Forward to a friend</p><p> ************************</p><h3> 5. Use MailChimp&rsquo;s forward to a friend feature</h3><p> <br/> There are a number of email programs available. One of the biggest is MailChimp. MailChimp includes a &ldquo;refer a friend&rdquo; feature. Using this feature as two advantages.</p><p> <strong>  Unsubscribe issues </strong> <br/> The Forward to a Friend link does not forward the email that your client received. This prevents the new recipient from accidentally unsubscribing your client.</p><p> <strong>  Reporting </strong> <br/> Forward to a Friend will show in your campaign report so you can see how often your email was forwarded and how often those forwarded emails were opened. You won&rsquo;t see this if a client simply forwards their email.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s how it works.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Step 1: Add a refer a friend form for your l </strong> ist</p><p> Follow  <u>  <a href=\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/campaigns/design/add-forward-to-a-friend-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   these instructions  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Step 2: Add the link to your email </strong></p><p> The MailChimp forward a friend guide explains the options. The easiest is to use the link tool by highlighting the text (e.g. &ldquo;Forward to a Friend&rdquo;, click on the icon, select the web link and paste *|FORWARD|* in the field.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a link to a refer a friend form that we created.</p><p> You can customize with your own design and copy.</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: The client&rsquo;s friend receives an email </strong></p><p> <strong>  A. Personalized subject </strong></p><p> The subject line is personalized to increase open rates.</p><p> [Client&rsquo;s name] is forwarding an email to you</p><p> <strong>  B. Personalized email </strong></p><p> The client personalized the email via the form.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example of the email that the client receives. You can edit the copy.</p><p> <strong>  Step 4: Promote the refer a friend program </strong></p><p> The refer a friend link option as a socially acceptable way for clients to introduce you to friends that may need help with their finances.</p><p> You can see whether your clients are forwarding your emails as well as whether they are being opened.</p><h3> 6. Use email automation</h3><p> <br/> Blueleaf users have email automation included as part of the platform. The weekly emails deliver highly relevant content without any effort. Engagement rates of over 90% with the email demonstrate how much clients&rsquo; value it.</p><p> You can also create your own automated email flows using tools like  <u>  <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/features/automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MailChimp  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"https://autopilothq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Autopilot  </a> </u> . Most email platforms now offer automation.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example of an automation flow.</p><p> <strong>  Step 1: </strong> Prospect fills out a form to download a financial planning checklist</p><p> <strong>  Step 2: </strong> 5 days after the download an email is automatically sent promoting a blog post that explain the checklist</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: </strong> 5 days after the blog post email, the prospect receives an email offering access to the advisor&rsquo;s client system (Blueleaf)</p><p> The automation set up is pretty easy to do. You can start small and add additional emails over time.</p><a href=\"https://blog.blueleaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/financial-advisor-email.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Financial Advisor Email Automation\" src=\"https://blog.blueleaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/financial-advisor-email.jpg\"/></a><p> Autopilot&rsquo;s drag and drop canvas makes setting up email automation easy</p><h3> 7. Extend your reach through Center of Influence marketing</h3><p> <br/> Most financial advisors email list is not huge. Clients and some prospects. Center of influence (COI) marketing can change that.</p><p> You know all about COI marketing and how working with other professionals like accountants and attorneys can drive great referrals. You also know it can be a huge waste of time with no near-term payoff.</p><p> Blueleaf helps with COI marketing. The simple sharing functionality means that you can securely share client data with your clients&rsquo; accountants and attorneys. Here&rsquo;s a short video showing how simple sharing via Blueleaf works.</p><p> Making contact is the first step. Developing an actionable plan to drive referrals is the next step.</p><p> Your email program helps here also. You can offer your existing content to your partners or even draft an email for them to send to their lists. Access to their email lists to dramatically grow your distribution.</p><h3> Final Thoughts</h3><p> <br/> There you have it.</p><p> A step-by-step guide to upgrading your email marketing program.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s the recap. </strong></p><li> Focus on using content to build trust by helping solve top problems</li><li> Increase your communication frequency and commit to your content calendar</li><li> Optimize your emails to maximize open and click throughs</li><li> Build in embedded referral triggers</li><li> Use email automation</li><li> Focus on expanding your distribution directly and through COI marketing</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 21:10:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 21:10:28.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_C5nkiT9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-email-is-the-king-of-financial-advisor-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"8662\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 21:10:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 21:10:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-email-is-the-king-of-financial-advisor-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8661\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4106\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-Email-is-the-King-of-Financial-Advisor-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1187\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453236300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Help those companies realize you&rsquo;re the right one by avoiding these four most devastating career behaviors.</p><h3> Before we dive in, I want to stress something.</h3><strong> Careers limp along or are dismantled because of behaviors, not decisions.</strong>You might fall into the trap of thinking you made a poor choice here or joined the wrong company there. Others endlessly ponder position changes or promotions they forwent (yes, that is a word and it&rsquo;s the first and last time I will ever use it).I assure you, those mini decisions (as major as you think they are) cause minor-league damage compared to the big boy stuff I&rsquo;m about to share. Let&rsquo;s have at it&hellip;<h3> Mine. Mine. Mine.</h3>Not sharing&hellip;as in your pencils, crayons, thoughts, ideas, so on and so forth. Your unwillingness to share your time and knowledge is one of the most limiting factors in your progression. People who subscribe to a scarcity mentally will never&mdash;ever&mdash;outpace people who believe in the abundance theory (nay the genius marketing people who use scarcity to get customers to buy your products). There is enough for everyone and then some in this world. Share and keep sharing. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at what you can create for others and yourself.<h3> I don&rsquo;t like today. I think I&rsquo;ll live tomorrow instead.</h3>Not living, uh, working, for today. Know what makes you happy and never let that be at the mercy of something that doesn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t worry about where you&rsquo;ll be in five years. I hate to tell you this, but you stink at predicting your future. Everyone does. Others are even worse at predicting your future. Want a sure bet? Focus on having fun doing what you&rsquo;re doing today. You&rsquo;ll do it better, surface more opportunities in the process, recognize what you love, and, hey presto, you&rsquo;ll be happier.

I can&rsquo;t get over the fact that most people think they will accomplish more in one day but less over their lifetimes. Think about it. How many times have you thought you could get that project done faster, run an extra errand, or whatever? Most overinflate the number of daily duties they can handle. If you&rsquo;re willing to squeeze so much into one minute or hour or day, why can&rsquo;t you climb several mountains during your lifetime? Write that book, build that business, and shoot for whatever star you want to reach.

{"original_id":3958,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"11 Ways a Nightmare Work Culture Sucks the Life out of Employees","link":"11-ways-a-nightmare-work-culture-sucks-the-life-out-of-employees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We've all been there before, heard stories from friends, or seen it on TV &mdash; nightmare organizational cultures exist everywhere. Despite having great colleagues, working in a toxic culture is energy draining, and you eventually lose any ounce of engagement.</p><p> This is worrisome since  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/2015-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our research  </a> </u>  found that an organization's culture is the number one factor that's related to employee happiness. So in laymen's terms: good culture equals happy employees. Here are 11 ways a terrible work culture can deplete employee engagement:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Employees take cutthroat competitions too literally </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sure, it's good practice to instill friendly competition here and there. But when competition gets cutthroat, you run the risk of employees sabotaging each other just to end up on top. And this is also bad news for your bottom line &mdash; people are more worried about ways to become number one rather than putting in quality work.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Employees become numb </strong></h3><p> <br/> Ever had a boss tell you your work doesn't matter and to do it just to get it done? I have in the past, and it made me feel like a Cyberman ( <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman\" target=\"_blank\">  see Doctor Who reference here </a> ). A toxic work culture can make employees lose passion for their work and become numb to their daily tasks.</p><h3> <strong>  3. A redundant routine makes them feel trapped </strong></h3><p> <br/> Because they're stuck doing the same routine day in and day out, employees feel like they're trapped. Hamster on a wheel, anyone? There's no room for growth, no forward momentum &mdash; and even worse, they start to lose their self-worth because they've been told their work doesn't matter.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Lack of voice equals lack of self-worth </strong></h3><p> <br/> Back to the idea of self-worth. When employees aren't given the chance to provide feedback to their managers or don't receive any recognition from anyone, they feel like they're not an important part of the organization.</p><h3> <strong>  5.  Cross-departmental friction breeds animosity </strong></h3><p> <br/> When two departments think they are above one another, you can bet there's going to be a rift in the workplace universe. They'll continue to butt heads because each department will have their own set of ways and ideas of doing things. And of course, they think they're both right.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Animosity is draining </strong></h3><p> <br/> Who wants to spend eight hours of their day with an elevated blood pressure? That's what it's like when teams are constantly working against each other. It's frustrating, to say the least. At the end of the day, employees feel completely drained of energy.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Lack of organization creates everyday fire drills </strong></h3><p> <br/> A company that lacks any direction or focus creates fire drills every day. Since there are no deadline for projects or other departments are making decisions without considering how they'll affect the other teams, employees are constantly sent scrambling to get things done. Again, energy draining.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Lack of communication is like beating a dead horse </strong></h3><p> <br/> Do we have an ETA for that spreadsheet? Crickets. Bumping up this email. Crickets. The deadline for this project is due in a few hours, when can we expect the spreadsheet? CRICKETS.</p><p> No one wants to wait on the edge of their seat for you to respond. Lack of communication is extremely frustrating for employees on all levels.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Forced recognition is worse than no recognition </strong></h3><p> <br/> Employee recognition only works when it's authentic and genuine. When you're forcing recognition, it's as if you're belittling employees. Enough said.</p><h3> <strong>  10. Employees can see through thoughtless recognition </strong></h3><p> <br/> The best quote I've ever heard a former coworker say after receiving a candy bar for her efforts was, \"A candy bar? This isn't going to help me pay rent.\" Of course, it didn't help that we were all incredibly underpaid.</p><p> But the point was that employees don't want candy bars, trophies, or certificates when they don't mean anything. It just makes people feel worthless because the organization didn't put any meaningful thought into the reward.</p><h3> <strong>  11. Toxic cultures ruin home lives </strong></h3><p> <br/> After an employee has spent all day at work being angry and frustrated, it's difficult for them to leave all those emotions at the office. They're going to bring it home with them and vent to their loved ones or just be in a perpetual bad mood. This can really take a toll on an employee's personal life outside of the workplace.</p><p> When your organization starts becoming a revolving door, there's one thing you need to start taking a look at &mdash; your company culture. And keep in mind that making changes is also a tricky ordeal that requires deliberate action. So take this moment to review your company's values and what  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/?utm_source=unpaid&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=blogtrial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TINYchanges  </a> </u>  you can start making today to improve employee engagement and morale.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 21:46:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 21:46:22.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ozGSzWW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/11-ways-a-nightmare-work-culture-sucks-the-life-out-of-employees/\", \"post_id\": \"8666\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 21:46:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 21:46:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"11-ways-a-nightmare-work-culture-sucks-the-life-out-of-employees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8665\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4108\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/11-Ways-a-Nightmare-Work-Culture-Sucks-the-Life-out-of-Employees.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"812\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453212000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

As we begin the New Year, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to get off your carousel of doom.</p><p> The big question after living this way for so long is: how do you stop? <strong>  Here are a few ideas to find your path to financial freedom and a life of happiness. </strong></p><li> <strong>  Fess up: </strong> like any addict, if you are spending your way to oblivion, you need to start by admitting that the problem exists.</li><li> <strong>  Envision your ideal outcome: </strong> knowing where you want to wind up is the best way to start. If you&rsquo;re living in a money nightmare, think about what your life without the nightmare looks like. Envision your life without debt, stress and misery. Picture your life with ease and financial security. How will you feel?</li><li> <strong>  Unearth the facts: </strong> come to grips with your numbers. How much do you owe? How much do you spend and on what? Know your net worth and your cash flow. Understand how much of your spending goes to unnecessary expenses that keep you mired in misery.</li><li> <strong>  Work with an expert: </strong> find a qualified and experienced fee-only Certified Financial Planner who can help you navigate the changes you need to make.</li><li> <strong>  Get all stakeholders onboard: </strong> living in Money Fantasy is not typically a solo affair&mdash;it impacts the entire family. Making real steps towards living a more &ldquo;real&rdquo; life requires all members of the family to work together for a successful outcome.</li><li> <strong>  Create small attainable goals: </strong> if the problem could have been solved by snapping your fingers, you would have done it already. Creating success is a process of change that requires intent, time and constant attention. Your chance of creating a cycle of living in money reality can be broken down into a series of small, deliberate and meaningful steps. The only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time!</li><li> <strong>  Celebrate successes: </strong> the road from misery to ultimate success can be life-long. Therefore, celebrating each step&mdash;regardless of how small&mdash;is important to build up and support your confidence that you are moving in the right direction.</li><li> <strong>  Keep the end in mind: </strong> there&rsquo;s nothing easier than falling back into bad or destructive habits. Keep your goals in the front of your thinking (visual cues work great for this) and monitor each step. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Living in Money Fantasy is like building a house made of straw in a tornado zone: nothing good can happen </strong> . Just try these small steps and you&rsquo;ll see that you CAN start living a full, rich and happy life built on your values. It takes time and attention, but I know you can do it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 21:50:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 21:50:51.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_uaqVXQN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/money-reality-vs-money-fantasy/\", \"post_id\": \"8668\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 21:50:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 21:50:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"money-reality-vs-money-fantasy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8667\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4109\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Money-Reality-vs.-Money-Fantasy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"404\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453210200,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3960,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Great Pieces Of Advice About Success","link":"5-great-pieces-of-advice-about-success","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> FBI agents are expected to be successful investigators. When a child is kidnapped, success in finding the kidnapper is not a desired outcome; it is a requirement.</h3><p> <br/> When facing distraught parents, you know deep down that you will do whatever it takes to bring that child home. Success is possible, but it takes mental toughness to sort through the hard facts about what it takes to succeed.</p><p> Here are five great pieces of advice to keep in mind about success:</p><h3> <strong>  1. SUCCESS REQUIRES AN ABUNDANCE OF WILLPOWER </strong></h3><p> <br/> For years we&rsquo;ve been told that willpower is limited&mdash;it&rsquo;s best saved for a sprint, not the race.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck\" target=\"_blank\">   Psychologist Carol Dweck  </a> </u> , author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-How-Fulfil-Your-Potential-ebook/dp/B000FCKPHG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408242474&amp;sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mindset  </a> </u> , strongly disagrees. She believes that willpower is limited only if we believe it is. We put boundaries around ourselves when we believe willpower is limited.</p><p> But if we are mentally strong leaders who believe that if we work hard, we will be energized to work more, then we are creating willpower. </p><p> As FBI agents working on child kidnappings and other crimes, we worked long hours in strenuous conditions and forged ahead to embrace even more challenging activities.</p><p> It turns out that willpower is in our head! </p><h3> <strong>  2. SUCCESS COMES EASIER IF YOU MAINTAIN A POSITIVE ATTITUDE </strong></h3><p> <br/> We are significantly more productive when we&rsquo;re feeling positive about our situation, even during tough times. </p><p> One of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.laraequy.com/blog/personal-leadership/6-reasons-mental-toughness-is-positivity-on-steroids/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   most important characteristics of mental toughness  </a> </u>  is the ability to find positive aspects in the middle of negative situations. Positive thinking does not give up or shut down when we&rsquo;re hit with an unexpected roadblock. Just the opposite&mdash;positivity nudges our brain to seek out more possibilities. We&rsquo;re smarter and more creative as a result.</p><p> Creative thinking was often the difference between success and failure in many of my FBI investigations.</p><p> Even pessimists can learn to be positive thinkers. </p><p> For each negative thought you have, write down 5 positive ones to counter it. If you cannot find 5 positive thoughts, write down 5 things for which you are grateful. Do this for several weeks and you will see begin to see changes in your behavior: not only will you connect better with others, you will also manage your stress.</p><h3> <strong>  3. SUCCESS IS ABOUT FAILING AS MUCH AS WINNING </strong></h3><p> <br/> If we want to be successful, we must learn how to fail.</p><p> Another way to build mental toughness is saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to situations where you know there is a likelihood you will fail. FBI training continually put new agents in situations where failure was imminent. </p><p> This may seem counterintuitive to anyone who strives to be successful&mdash;after all, why would you intentionally place yourself in a situation where you might make a mistake or fail? </p><p> There are three reasons: </p><li> <strong>  Success comes from stretching yourself toward peak performance. </strong> If you do not keep moving into your discomfort zone, you will stop growing. And when that happens, you surround yourself with mediocrity.</li><li> <strong>  Success requires that you analyze and critique your failures because you learn something about yourself that you did not know before. </strong> Strong minded leaders allow this knowledge to show them how to be successful next time around.</li><li> <strong>  Success hinges on choosing to put yourself in situations where you will fail or come up short so you&rsquo;ll be aware of your reaction. </strong> This is incredibly important in today&rsquo;s volatile work environment since your ability to predict your response to a disruption will allow you to land on your feet, rather than be caught off guard and simply react, and perhaps not in ways that help your leadership move forward. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  4. SUCCESS IS THE PRODUCT OF HAPPINESS, NOT VICE VERSA </strong></h3><p> <br/> Most us believe just the opposite&mdash;that success will bring us happiness, but the reverse is actually true.</p><p> Shawn Achor, author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Performance/dp/0307591549\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Happiness Advantage  </a> </u> , says that if we work harder to achieve our goal, we think we&rsquo;ll be happier. But research is clear that every time we experience success, our brain changes the definition of what success means. In essence, success will always be an elusive goal, so if we&rsquo;re expecting happiness to be the result of our hard work, we&rsquo;re most likely never going to get there!</p><p> Instead, increase levels of happiness in the midst of a challenge, and you will find that your success rate will increase as well. It&rsquo;s important to remember that joy is a deeper emotion that is connected with well being, living a life of meaning, and living according to values.</p><p> A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones&mdash;Proverbs 17:22 (ESV)</p><h3> <strong>  5. SUCCESS REQUIRES A GOOD KICK IN THE BUTT EVERY SO OFTEN </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s tempting for us to whine and complain when life doesn&rsquo;t turn out the way we expected or planned. We feel life isn&rsquo;t fair when we compare ourselves to others.</p><p> Here is the bitter pill for you to swallow: what you&rsquo;re feeling has nothing to do with fairness; it&rsquo;s all about entitlement.</p><p> You have total control over your attitude, so if something is wrong put that mental energy into making the situation better&mdash;unless you plan to whine about it forever.</p><p> Your words have power, especially over you. Don&rsquo;t talk about what&rsquo;s wrong. Talk about how you&rsquo;ll make things better, even if that conversation is only with yourself. Positive self-talk is a cornerstone in training for Special Forces, FBI agents, and anyone who wants to be successful.</p><p> When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, &ldquo;I used everything you gave me&rdquo;&mdash;Erma Bombeck</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-18 21:59:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-18 21:59:04.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_BwpCy0P.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-great-pieces-of-advice-about-success/\", \"post_id\": \"8670\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-18 21:59:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-18 21:59:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-great-pieces-of-advice-about-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8669\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4110\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Great-Pieces-Of-Advice-About-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"747\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453233600,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3961,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Think Resonance","link":"think-resonance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You&rsquo;re building your tribe. Translating what makes you flesh-and-blood compelling into digital form. Your website. Social media. E-marketing.</p><h3> Think resonance.</h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;re on the receiving end you know it&mdash;viscerally. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up when you encounter someone preaching what you need to hear. Or you compulsively read and watch everything on their site because you just can&rsquo;t get enough. And then you share it because it&rsquo;s just too good to keep to yourself.</p><h3> THAT&rsquo;S resonance.</h3><p> <br/> I met my client &ldquo;Patrick&rdquo; exactly that way. He was looking for an investor in his business (which was not going to be me), but during that conversation we had a business-love-at-first-hearing call. Our biggest visions and values were EXACTLY aligned and we started brainstorming and engaging and sharing dreams. I knew, with that sort of deep sense of knowing, that he would be a pivotal person in my life in some way. Indeed&mdash;he hired me to cook up some magic that just may be a game-changer for both of us.</p><h3> So how do you get YOUR tribe to resonate with you that way?</h3><p> <br/> Embrace your digital tribe. Lots of new clients obsess over this, especially when they have a thriving off-line business. It pains them to pick a niche and narrow their potential audience. But the fastest way to build a brand on-line is to pick your niche and embrace it 100%. This also means not wasting months (or years) agonizing over how to slice and dice your audience. Just start. Tip: Twitter is an excellent place to experiment. Find one person who looks like they should be in your tribe and follow them. Read and engage in their tweets. Repeat.</p><p> Tune in to your tribe vibe. When you&rsquo;re building a tribe one person at a time&mdash;say with a brand-spanking new idea&mdash;YOU&rsquo;RE setting the vibe. It must be uniquely yours, exquisitely aligned with who you are and what you&rsquo;re selling to resonate at the highest frequency with your sweet-spot. When you&rsquo;re trying to parachute into an existing tribe (which by the way is often FAR easier than starting your own), you&rsquo;ve got to marry the beliefs, norms and styles of the group with your own clear, compelling and distinctive voice. Either approach takes time&mdash;think drip over deluge&mdash;but is an excellent investment in building relationships.</p><p> Get down and dirty. Not dropping f bomb dirty, although that does seem to be a trend. I&rsquo;m talking about showing a little bit of your underbelly&mdash;candidly sharing what didn&rsquo;t work, right alongside the amazing things that did. My own post  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/what-do-you-suck-at/%20%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   What do you suck at?  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  where I cop to a lengthy list of non-talents still inspires email exchanges two and a half years later. And it brought me a client who claims reading it made her call me. Go figure.</p><h3> Be selective. </h3><p> <br/> There will be people who crop up in your digital life who will be game-changers for both of you and others who will be a colossal waste of your time. It&rsquo;s not always blindingly obvious who falls into which category. So select the ones where you feel real resonance&mdash;you vibrate with their message, their delivery, their vision for the future. You may not do anything together now, but you might have just invested in someone who will change your life later.</p><p> Building resonance allows you to build connective, deeply satisfying, on-brand business. You not only attract your best clients, buyers and readers, but you create rich experiences for all of you.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 16:35:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 16:35:59.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Uee1ezm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/think-resonance/\", \"post_id\": \"8672\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 16:35:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 16:35:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"think-resonance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8671\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4111\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Think-Resonance.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"731\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453305600,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}

This could refer to the service itself or how and to whom you extend the service.

No, it isn&rsquo;t the cold, or the dreariness of winter. It&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, this holiday of love was a day or warmth, surprises, celebration, and hugs. Spouses anticipated receiving a special card, candy or a carefully selected gift, extra attention, and reassurance of their lovability. Yet for widowed spouses, the day is cold and bleak. Hearing the ads and watching couples make goo-goo eyes at each other rubs the scab raw and thrusts the cold spear deeper into broken hearts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves them feeling even more alone and isolated. At the very least, send a card with a small gift. For instance: &ldquo;No gift could make up for Jim&rsquo;s absence. Still, I hope you can enjoy a few chocolates from someone who cares. We are thinking of you today.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;A single rose in memory of Karen. Her love for you and for so many people lives on in our hearts forever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you really want to make a long-term impression, consider organizing an event early in the day for widowed clients. Invite them to a breakfast or brunch, and do it up right. Have a nice meal, an attractive centerpiece, and attentive staff, so they feel pampered. When all are seated, welcome the group, saying you know Valentine&rsquo;s Day can be difficult for widowed people and you wanted to give them something fun to anticipate along with the pain the day is sure to bring.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrint a list of questions for discussion and place it at each table to break the ice and get them sharing with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Tell how you and your spouse met each other.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tell one thing that drove you crazy about your spouse.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tell one well-meaning thing someone said to you after your spouse died that was unintentionally hurtful to you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After the meal, thank everyone for coming and tell them you plan to make this an annual event so they can return the next year. Perhaps have a drawing for the centerpieces at each table. As your guests leave, give them a small token such as a real or chocolate flower. Tell them you will call in a week or two to see what they liked best and if they have any suggestions for how you could improve the event next year. Then, of course, do call and take their feedback seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These suggestions bracket the range of possibilities. The important thing is to be there for your clients in ways that most other people aren&rsquo;t. When you demonstrate that you understand their grief and you care about more than just the money, you gain a client for life. And when their friends and associates are widowed, what will they tell them about their uncommonly wise and compassionate advisor?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 18:07:54.000000","last_updated":"2024-05-29 22:38:26.609982","image_url":"2016/1/make-a-difference-on-valentines-day.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":"","white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"<p>If you really want to make a long-term impression, consider organizing an event early in the day for widowed clients.</p>","placefilter":0,"rss_include":0,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/make-a-difference-on-valentines-day/\", \"post_id\": \"8675\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 18:07:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 18:07:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"make-a-difference-on-valentines-day\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8676\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4114\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Make-a-Difference-on-Valentine\\u2019s-Day.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"753\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":36474,"author_id":24,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3965,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Times To Stop Saying You're Sorry","link":"5-times-to-stop-saying-youre-sorry","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarjiJSherman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Marji J. Sherman  </u> </a></p><h3> I have two things that I do when I am super nervous &rarr; constantly apologize and giggle like no other.</h3><p> <br/> I was so nervous when I first met my boyfriend, that giggled so hard I cried. Yes, it&rsquo;s that bad.</p><p> While I don&rsquo;t have an immediate fix for my giggling-issues, I have started working on my overly-apologizing issue, primarily because I&rsquo;ve been called out on it numerous times. One of the first times I realized I did it was during a feminism class in college. Our professor gave us a list of things women say that belittle them, and I was shocked to realize I used absolutely every word on the list (and still use some, because, after all, I am a woman and I don&rsquo;t think saying one word makes me &lsquo;less than&rsquo;.)</p><p> One of the most recent times was when I was apologizing for being sick. I felt just awful for wrecking the mood at a holiday event by being sooo sick. One of my friends took me by the hand, looked in my eyes and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever apologize for being sick. Why would you ever apologize for something like that?&rdquo; Hmm. He had a pretty good point.</p><p> So, I&rsquo;ve spent some time thinking about when I apologize the most out of insecurity, rather out of ownership of doing something wrong. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with as &lsquo;danger-zones&rsquo; where we apologize too much:</p><h3> When Someone Misunderstands You</h3><p> <br/> Someone not &lsquo;getting&rsquo; you can create a pretty awkward environment which can spur the immediate, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t say it. It is neither of your faults that there is misunderstanding, and by apologizing for it you are saying that it&rsquo;s more important for you to explain yourself properly than it is for someone else to take the time to understand you. Both parts are equally important, and apologies are unnecessary on both sides.</p><h3> When You Are Sick</h3><p> <br/> Being sick creates havoc. Suddenly you are cancelling events, postponing projects, dampening the mood in the room. While you can apologize for last-minute changes, you should never apologize for the fact you are sick. You can&rsquo;t control that, and it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;ve &lsquo;done wrong&rsquo;. Own the fact that you are sick, stay on top of your responsibilities as best as you can, and never feel bad that you are unfortunately dealing with any type of illness.</p><h3> When You Are In The Midst Of Events Out Of Your Control</h3><p> <br/> As long as you are doing everything in your control to manage the events that are &lsquo;out of your control&rsquo;, you should never, EVER apologize for the event itself. Take the bull by the horns and do the best you can to be flexible about unexpected circumstances, but don&rsquo;t take on the blame for them.</p><h3> When Someone Dislikes Your Work</h3><p> <br/> Your work is your work, and you should never apologize for it. If you didn&rsquo;t follow specific directions on a creative brief, than maybe, but if you did your best and someone just has a certain opinion about it, accept their opinion but do not say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo;. By doing that you are discrediting your work and creative talents.</p><h3> When Someone Disagrees With You</h3><p> <br/> If you have a personality like mine, then it is often hard to have a conversation with someone that disagrees with you because you just want everyone to agree with you. In fact, you will even apologize just so that person likes you better. Don&rsquo;t do it &rarr; stand by your opinion. It&rsquo;s yours, and you have a right to express it. However, also remain open-minded and take the other person&rsquo;s opinion into consideration.</p><p> Granted, you will always have legitimate thing to apologize for. As one of my favorite sayings goes, apologizing doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re wrong, it just means you are valuing your relationship over your ego. However, we have to be aware of times where we overly-apologize and discredit our work, opinions and stance on important issues in life.</p><p> Try seeing how many times you inadvertently apologize for things this week. You&rsquo;ll be surprised!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 19:01:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 19:01:50.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Af0ltKP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-times-to-stop-saying-youre-sorry/\", \"post_id\": \"8677\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 19:01:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 19:01:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-times-to-stop-saying-youre-sorry\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8676\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4115\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Make-a-Difference-on-Valentine\\u2019s-Day.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"512\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453320000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3966,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Invest Like an Entrepreneur to Outperform the Norm: Mastering Nine Key Traits","link":"how-to-invest-like-an-entrepreneur-to-outperform-the-norm-mastering-nine-key-traits","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/batoninvesting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Phil Ash  </u> </a> | <u>  Baton Investing </u></p><p> Essential characteristics embodying the very spirit of entrepreneurial investors, capturing the dynamic essence of self-starters to ensure that entrepreneurs&ndash;and others who share their groundbreaking spirit&ndash;will always have the financial fuel they need to achieve their dreams.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no secret the majority of entrepreneurs boast a strong feeling of self-reliance and self-confidence, particularly if they&rsquo;ve already achieved success in their business. That&rsquo;s why it makes sense that, when it comes to investing, many accomplished entrepreneurs entrust themselves with money management over an advisor at their local bank or neighborhood financial firm&mdash;or even a high powered Wall Street broker for that matter. For committed entrepreneurs, money is not a luxury, but the very lifeblood for their vision&mdash;it&rsquo;s what sustains them in the here and now, and what fuels their dreams, aspirations and future goals.</p><p> For the successful entrepreneur, achievement is not something that&rsquo;s just possible; it&rsquo;s an outright expectation, even when it comes to something as volatile and inherently risky as investing.</p><h3> The nine key traits of the entrepreneurial investor:</h3><h3>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Determination. </strong></p><p> Making the decision to take a specific course of action, setting appropriate goals and then having the grit to go accomplish those goals are the keys to successful business execution. The same is true with entrepreneurial-minded investing: calculate your financial goal, pick a proven strategy with the necessary average annual returns to get you there, and stay the course. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Risk-taking. </strong></p><p> Successful entrepreneurs are natural risk-takers; however, they are also smart about the kinds of risks they take and the method in which they are taken. Knowing when and how to separate from the herd and break away from norms and rules makes all the difference. That is the secret sauce for wildly accomplished &ldquo;contrarian investors&rdquo; like Warren Buffett.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Confidence. </strong></p><p> Being wishy-washy and indecisive rarely yields any positive results. Confidence comes from trusting a system, methodology or approach that has a proven track record&mdash;evidence that it can deliver desired results. So when it comes to investing, they seek out proven, tried-and-true systems that boost their odds of success. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Adaptability. </strong></p><p> Financial markets are fluid and your investment choices must be too. Successful investors no longer subscribe to conventional strategies like &ldquo;buy-and-hold&rdquo; and &ldquo;broad diversification&rdquo; to try to beat the market. Rather, they often use automated and other systems to constantly analyze markets and pick the handful of best investments in any market conditions and to buy and sell stocks monthly as the numbers change. Being nimble and knowing when to zig instead of zag can help you take advantage of tremendous buying opportunities. <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Passion. </strong></p><p> Everyone falls in love with a story stock like Apple, Whole Foods or Tesla from time to time. And, like a passionate fling, they can be amazing for a while. But both the successful entrepreneur and the fruitful investor know how to moderate their passion and eliminate emotion from key decisions. And if they can&rsquo;t easily do that, they&rsquo;re smart enough to surround themselves with people or systems that can. <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Money mastery. </strong></p><p> Even entrepreneurs who hate numbers eventually learn to understand and master them. Not understanding key investing metrics like returns and expenses is a sure-fire recipe for never hitting your goal. Entrepreneurs further understand the importance of budgeting, CapEx analysis, and protecting their hard-earned capital&mdash;all of which are important skills for improving your personal finances. <br/> <br/> <strong>  7. Vision. </strong></p><p> Entrepreneurs and savvy investors both know where they want to go and how they plan to get there. Entrepreneurs aim for their &ldquo;Big Hairy Audacious Goal&rdquo; (BHAG), as popularized by Jim Collins. It&rsquo;s a goal that may take 15 years or more to achieve but if they hit it, life will be infinitely better. Likewise, smart investors set a clear goal that may seem impossible to others but is totally achievable with the right plan. <br/> <br/> <strong>  8. Networking. </strong></p><p> Visionaries like Steve Jobs seemingly blaze new ground with iPods and iPhones, but in large part they&rsquo;re just building on what other successful people have done before them. These &ldquo;visionaries&rdquo; rely on their network to guide and help them along the way. Investing is no different. Just look at exactly how and why the greatest investors of all time like Buffett, Lynch and Graham have been successful and do that! <br/> <br/> <strong>  9. Lifelong learning. </strong></p><p> Like cultivating an entrepreneurial business acumen in an ever-evolving marketplace, continually honing finance and investment skills is an imperative. Commit yourself to the ongoing process of learning about myriad investment techniques and types. Remain a seeker of new wisdom. There is a wealth of information available that is always growing and changing so your knowledge base needs to grow and change with it.</p><p> Entrepreneurs and investors are quite alike in the sense they are willing to take calculated risks for which the payoff can be substantial. It's this shared spirit that can help the entrepreneurial-minded investor cultivate a profitable portfolio that outperforms most other investors and achieves your financial goal.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 20:01:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 20:01:14.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_8AhlVsm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-invest-like-an-entrepreneur-to-outperform-the-norm-mastering-nine-key-traits/\", \"post_id\": \"8679\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 20:01:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 20:01:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-invest-like-an-entrepreneur-to-outperform-the-norm-mastering-nine-key-traits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8678\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4116\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Invest-Like-an-Entrepreneur-to-Outperform-the-Norm.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"749\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453286700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":3968,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Build Peer Relationships with Your Clients","link":"how-to-build-peer-relationships-with-your-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<p> To become a client&rsquo;s trusted advisor, you must be viewed as a peer. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you must become a literal peer. If you work with a CEO, for example, you will never be their strict peer in an organizational or hierarchical sense. But if you want a seat at the table with them, they need to consider you as a peer in three areas:  Professional acumen, behavior, and values. Let&rsquo;s look at what these are and how you demonstrate them.</p><h3> Building Peer Relationships</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Professional Acumen. </strong>  Acumen is, literally, &ldquo;the ability to make good judgments and take quick decisions.&rdquo; Clients want a peer who can partner with them to solve their toughest problems, capture opportunities, and achieve their goals. More broadly, I would define professional acumen as a valuable combination of five qualities:</p><p> <strong>  Experience:  </strong> Your client needs reassurance that you&rsquo;ve addressed this same issue many times before, most likely in their specific industry and/or function. Or, that you have other, related experience that will provide a new and different perspective.</p><p> Can you frame your experience in a compelling and relevant way?</p><p> <strong>  Expertise:  </strong> Most of your clients are going to have expertise in your same specialty. In some cases they may know less than you, in others they may be equally or more expert.</p><p> Do you focus on your expertise and methodologies too early in your client conversations? Can you show, at the right moment, how it applies to your client&rsquo;s most critical issues?</p><p> <strong>  Knowledge Breadth: </strong>  Senior executives in particular will look for a peer advisor who has in-depth expertise AND knowledge breadth. They want someone who understands the interrelationships between different parts of their business&ndash;someone who has an  <strong>  enterprise-wide perspective </strong> .</p><p> In addition to talking about the specific, presenting problem that your client has, are you able to have broad-based conversations with them about their business issues?</p><p> <strong>  Judgment: </strong>  Clients face more strategic and operational choices than ever before. You establish yourself as a peer when you demonstrate your ability to discern between different courses of action and to help your client make tough decisions. Commodity experts and advisors make judgments differently. Experts combine facts and experience to make a decision. Advisors combine facts, experience, and a deep understanding of their client&rsquo;s  values, beliefs, and  organizational capabilities  as they recommend decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Insight. </strong>  Insight means having a strong sense of perception. That is, seeing issues clearly and being able to separate the wheat from the chaff. Insight leads to idea generation and innovation, which are treasured by clients.</p><p> Are you learning enough about your client&rsquo;s actual business to be able to make incisive observations about potential improvements? Are you working hard to see knowledge connections and possible analogies from related fields?</p><p> All five of these qualities add up to the intellectual strength&mdash;the professional acumen&mdash;that senior clients look for in a peer relationship with an outside advisor or service provider.</p><p> <strong>  2. C-Suite Behavior. </strong>  A top CEO headhunter told me once about a candidate for a senior job that he had all but turned down  just by spying him in the reception area of his Manhattan offices. He said, &ldquo;The candidate had only been there for a few minutes, and he was sitting quietly on the couch. That told me right away that he probably didn&rsquo;t have the C-Suite mindset&mdash;the confidence needed to operate at the level the job required. CEO candidates don&rsquo;t sit and wait&mdash;they stand. That way, when you walk in to pick them up and take them back to your office, they are not in an inferior or supplicant position. Most of them do this without even thinking about it. When I walk out and they are standing, the relationship starts on a peer level.&rdquo; Trivial? Not at all. Clients look at these subtle behavioral clues and make judgments very rapidly. Here are some of the behaviors you need to manifest if you want to establish senior-level, peer client relationships:</p><p> <strong>  A willingness to challenge your client. </strong> I call this &ldquo;selfless independence&rdquo; in my book  Clients for Life . A division president at a major bank once told me, &ldquo;I divide all the advisors I use into two groups: Those who simply do what I say, and those who will push back and sometimes say &lsquo;No.&rsquo; A few of these latter individuals are my trusted advisors. The others are really suppliers.&rdquo;  Remember, if you&rsquo;re concerned about coming across as too challenging, try turning your statements into questions. Instead of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your team is collaborating very well&rdquo; try &ldquo;How do you feel about the collaboration within your team?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll create more buy-in that way.</p><p> <strong>  An attitude that establishes equality. </strong>  If you keep thanking your client, over and over again, for &ldquo;taking so much of their valuable time to meet with you,&rdquo; what does that convey? Better would be, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted we were able to meet today. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Confident body language. </strong>  In an interview for one of my books, a CEO told me, &ldquo;If you walk into a client&rsquo;s office with your head held high, there&rsquo;s always the chance that you&rsquo;ll get knocked down a notch. That&rsquo;s a small risk. But if you go in on your knees, no client will ever, ever lift you up.&rdquo; If you are anxious or nervous when you meet with a senior client, or if your body language betrays anything less than a belief that you belong in the room with that executive, it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll be viewed as a peer.</p><p> <strong>  Showing courage. </strong> Do you fold your tent at the slightest provocation, or do you hold your ground? What if a prospect is acting bored and unengaged, and basically sending the message that they have no interest whatsoever in talking to you. You might ask, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious, why did you accept this the invitation to meet up? Did you have a particular issue in mind for our discussion?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got another 20 minutes scheduled for our meeting this morning. How can I be helpful to you during this time?&rdquo; If a prospect tells you, &ldquo;We have no need for what you do. There&rsquo;s not a lot to talk about right now&rdquo; you might respond with &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised how many of my best clients today told me that when we first met. Do you mind if I ask you a question&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  3. Values. </strong>  If a client is hiring a vendor to do a job and then get out of the way, they won&rsquo;t be hugely concerned with that suppliers&rsquo; value system. Yes, they will want someone with integrity and honesty, who treats people well, and so on. But fundamentally it&rsquo;s a relatively arm&rsquo;s-length relationship. In contrast, if an executive is drawing someone into their inner circle, they are going to be looking for serious alignment of values and beliefs. These go well beyond the basics of integrity&mdash;they might include a client&rsquo;s sense of your:</p><li> Authenticity</li><li> Ambition</li><li> Outlook (Optimistic? Pessimistic?)</li><li> Risk propensity</li><li> Action bias</li><li> Relationship orientation <br/>  </li><p> And so on.</p><p> You cannot manufacture a set of values and beliefs to match those of your client. But you can be open about what you stand for and what&rsquo;s important to you. You want your clients to sense these things and be attracted to them. The chemistry and fit won&rsquo;t always be there, but if you&rsquo;re overly buttoned down and keep your cards too close to your chest, your clients won&rsquo;t even get the chance to know you. And, you&rsquo;ll come across as anodyne and bland.</p><p> <strong>  Finally </strong> , you have to believe you are a peer. You have to believe you belong in your top client&rsquo;s corner office. You must possess a strong sense of your own value and your ability to help your clients improve and grow their business. That deep belief in yourself and what what you have to offer will by itself go very far towards creating the peer relationship you desire.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 21:01:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 21:01:59.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_H261wqp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-build-peer-relationships-with-your-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"8683\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 21:01:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 21:01:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-build-peer-relationships-with-your-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8682\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4118\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Building-Relationships-with-Clients-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"682\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453285800,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

Brace yourself for volatility &ndash; be prepared for a downturn &ndash; and so on &ndash; all focused on the short-term.  However two financial gurus, Larry Fink and Warren Buffett, are long-term thinkers (read the interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in HBR November 2015).  Fink is &ldquo;on a crusade against short-term thinking&rdquo; which he refers to as short-termism.</p><p> Kudos to Mr. Fink for providing HBR with an extremely insightful interview; which was the inspiration for this article.  Using hockey great Wayne Gretzky&rsquo;s alleged response when asked what made him great, &ldquo;I skate to where the puck is going to be.&rdquo;  Not that we should put our heads in the sand regarding the short-term, but financial advisors would be well served by paying more attention to where the &ldquo;financial advisory puck&rdquo; is going to be long-term, or at least three to five years from now.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not pretending to have a crystal ball, but we have a decade of research on affluent consumers and elite financial advisors.  After thoroughly reviewing our findings, studying the trends, confusing myself - ha, and then finally breaking through to the fresh air of simplicity, I&rsquo;ve broken this long-term approach into the three components, to borrow a geometric shape; vertices of an equilateral triangle.  </p><p> I could add a fourth, embracing excellence &ndash; but excellence is a constant running through all three vertices.        </p><h3> <strong>  3 Vertices for Advisors Skating to Where the Puck&rsquo;s Going to Be  </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Point 1: Embracing Technology</h3><p> <br/> The following are all being used very successfully by financial advisors with whom we&rsquo;ve worked.  Obviously it&rsquo;s essential that every financial advisor keep their use of technology within their compliance guidelines.  </p><p> &gt;  <strong>  Video Portfolio Reviews </strong> &ndash; There&rsquo;s a handful of financial advisors we&rsquo;ve coached who are conducting portfolio reviews for time crunched clients through video.</p><p> &gt;  <strong>  Social Media </strong> &ndash; This goes beyond LinkedIn, albeit LinkedIn is the most robust for professional use.  A financial advisor&rsquo;s brand is digital and it&rsquo;s important to be capitalizing on all aspects of social media.</p><p> &gt; <strong>  Websites </strong> &ndash; Because your brand is digital and financial advisor Google searches are becoming commonplace, your website needs to be clean, current, and reflect your value proposition. </p><p> &gt; <strong>  Video Content </strong> &ndash; Today&rsquo;s affluent don&rsquo;t like being the target of marketing campaigns and don&rsquo;t trust advertising.  So what&rsquo;s a financial advisor to do?  Embrace content marketing.  YouTube and Facebook have taken videos mainstream.  95% of Millennials think they can learn how to do anything on YouTube.  We&rsquo;ve helped a number of financial advisors get on the cutting edge of this by creating 2-3 minute helpful videos on topics like; 3 Things You Should Know When Creating a Financial Plan, and so on.  As an aside, I was talking to my attorney last night and he said &ldquo;At 61 years old I learned how to box &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve gotten good!  My instructor &ndash; YouTube.&rdquo;</p><p> &gt;  <strong>  Podcasts </strong> &ndash; Not popular with financial advisors yet, but an excellent medium for content marketing.  A word of caution, these require a lot of work.</p><p> &gt;  <strong>  Blogging </strong> &ndash; Another form of content marketing, somewhat similar to podcasts, without the structure.  But again, these require work.</p><p> The objective with content marketing is being positioned as a thought leader, a knowledge based resource.  The above list is far from complete and will always be fluid, technology is changing faster than I can write these words. </p><h3> Point 2: Embracing the Entire Affluent Household</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the first client video review by one of our financial advisors included the entire household; husband, wife, daughter who was in graduate school and son who was an undergraduate student.  The client specifically asked to schedule the video review when the children were going to be home.  That video review led to opening accounts for both of this household&rsquo;s next generation.  As an aside, the financial advisor was convinced that the father wanted to show-off his new video technology to his kids.  Ha!</p><p> Today&rsquo;s affluent want their financial advisor to oversee every aspect of their family&rsquo;s financial affairs.  That includes the children.  Whether it&rsquo;s setting up college funds, educating them on investments, role-playing job interviews, or offering career guidance &ndash; affluent parents are starved for this kind of care and guidance.  Yet, only 21% of financial advisors have ever expressed an interest in working with the children of their affluent clients.  I&rsquo;ve had advisors tell me &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them &ndash; they&rsquo;ve got no money and are a hassle.&rdquo;  A sad example of Larry Fink&rsquo;s short termism.</p><h3> Point 3: Embracing Comprehensive Wealth Management</h3><p> <br/> Financial advisors seem to have a disconnect between how they get paid and the services they provide.  This is the mentality of the stockbroker of yesteryear.  And they are today&rsquo;s dinosaur.  From the viewpoint of today&rsquo;s affluent, it&rsquo;s not how you get paid, it&rsquo;s whether they are getting their money&rsquo;s worth for the service their family needs.  Elite advisors understand this and provide services that go far beyond the immediacy of compensation.  </p><p> The idea is to provide real and comprehensive financial planning.  Help your clients follow the plan, make adjustments when necessary &ndash; but don&rsquo;t be like this financial advisor who checked the box on a form that indicated that he&rsquo;d provided a financial plan for each of his affluent clients.  This led to, on their statements, each client being informed that they had a financial plan and were on track.  Not good.  Clients were lost and negative affluent buzz (word-of-mouth influence) was activated within affluent COIs.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to be a forward thinker who takes the appropriate actions.  Be it with technology, the next generation, seniors in need of assisted living, or the ongoing evolution of wealth management solutions &ndash; much like today, tomorrows affluent will want a financial advisor who is current, truly cares for his or her clients, and has incorporated excellence as the DNA of their practice.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 21:11:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 21:11:38.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_xKgSEc4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-are-you-skating-to-where-the-puck-is-going-to-be/\", \"post_id\": \"8684\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 21:11:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 21:11:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-are-you-skating-to-where-the-puck-is-going-to-be\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8682\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4119\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Building-Relationships-with-Clients-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"620\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453280400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3970,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Find Real Value With Impact Investing","link":"find-real-value-with-impact-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In 2000, I had an established network of supporters who had trusted me through the funding of three ventures.</h3><p> <br/> Like me, these investors did not want the best of the worst (often referred to as &ldquo;best of class&rdquo;), but wanted to invest in companies that were making a positive difference in the world. Here are some lessons learned in the interim that apply to all investors.</p><p> First, I had to persuade clients to compromise their values a bit for the sake of diversification and invest in imperfect mutual funds while I developed my own list of positive stocks.</p><p> Second, to make sure <strong>  my incentive was always aligned with my clients&rsquo; goals I opted for a set fee arrangement rather than charging commissions on transactions. </strong>   I had been taught to avoid brokers who rely on your willingness to pay commission on each sale (especially annuities). There are, however, ethical brokers who trade only occasionally, and one may argue that this works out to be less expensive than a set advisory fee charged year after year with essentially little change in the portfolio. Now my firm offers impact strategies without advisory fees.</p><p> Third, I wanted to find ways to <strong>  avoid simply rising and falling with the markets changing fortunes. </strong> Most brokers who trade individual stocks depend on analysts from big banks, and when I looked at prospects&rsquo; portfolios I saw a remarkable similarity in the mix of holdings.  I wanted to find companies not followed by analysts but that had great stories. My courage and perhaps my confidence were boosted altogether too much with my first stock pick, which went up 2,000 percent in two years.</p><p> The best-performing stock in that ten-year period was Hanson Natural Soda, whose Blue Sky brand was carried by Whole Foods and Trader Joe&rsquo;s. While Trader Joe&rsquo;s was private, Whole Foods stock was overpriced, selling at more than twenty-five times what the company was currently earning. Meanwhile, Hanson was a deep &ldquo;value stock,&rdquo; priced at five times earnings. I guessed the company would surely benefit by the astounding growth of these two retailers, so I acquired it for all my clients.</p><p> An article about Hanson in the  Wall Street Journal  soon afterwards caused its price to double and double and split (a share is issued for each share owned because the price is too high to believe!). It continued on in this way, growing exponentially in two years. Eventually I learned that, in addition to &ldquo;natural&rdquo; soda, Hanson produced Monster, a caffeine drink targeting kids. I decided to get out, taking a handsome profit for my clients.</p><p> Realizing this experience was anecdotal and perhaps beginner&rsquo;s luck, I was still encouraged to look outside the boxed-in universe that I saw in almost every prospective client&rsquo;s portfolio. The same stocks were weighted heavily, with many different mutual funds owning the same stocks. Following the majority, and listening to the same commentators and analysts and wholesalers, seemed to me inherently risky. The phrase &ldquo;a high tide lifts all boats&rdquo; would apply equally to a low tide, so I wanted to find a deep cove away from the marina. The problem with this approach is liquidity. You can buy but it is sometimes hard to sell.</p><p> Every bank or brokerage firm has a limited list of managers allowed on its platform (the &ldquo;stable&rdquo;) and have agreements with only certain analysts, each of which has a small universe of stocks they tend to follow and know something about. Emerging managers with fresh ideas and unheard-of stocks are largely off-limits. Many public companies (more than 60,000 globally) are hard to trade.</p><p> Certainly the status quo feels safer but my question remains: <strong>  &ldquo;What is the value of advisors if they all follow the same course of action?&rdquo; </strong> They may be better hand holders than I, but the work they are doing for clients is often neither original nor truly customized. This bothers me, especially since the common theme in all marketing is &ldquo;performance.&rdquo; The reality I have observed is that:</p><li> The best managers in any five-year period tend to be in the middle or worse in the next five (they&rsquo;ve already taken their profits and often run out of steam);</li><li> The average active manager, trying to beat the market by picking the best stocks, underperforms the market by the amount charged in fees;</li><li> Most investors underperform mutual funds by coming in late on a growth spurt and leaving in disbelief on a downturn. <br/>  </li><p> Investors being shown &ldquo;performance&rdquo; still want &ldquo;in,&rdquo; despite disclaimers that past performance may not be indicative of future performance. I was at Legg Mason in the heyday of Bill Miller, who broke all records by beating the S&amp;P 500 fifteen years in a row. This was unheard of. And to his credit he warned new investors that this pattern might not continue. Despite his brilliance, much of his success could be attributed to his troop of advisors who flowed new cash to him every month. He could risk buying stocks at lower and lower valuations as they slid downward&mdash;then, like magic, when they popped back up, he had an unusual gain. As soon as all the advisors including me were shipped off to Citigroup Smith Barney in 2006, Miller&rsquo;s cash cow reversed as the advisors took their profits and moved on. His performance went from best to worst in a relatively short time.</p><p> This article was first published on <u>  <a href=\"http://stretchadime.com/real-value-impact-investing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stretch A Dime  </a>  . </u></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 21:22:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 21:22:47.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_VQGpMGY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/find-real-value-with-impact-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"8686\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 21:22:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 21:22:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"find-real-value-with-impact-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8685\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4120\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Find-Real-Value-With-Impact-Investing.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"673\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453298400,"author_id":181,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3971,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Being Reliable Is Not A Winning Career Strategy","link":"why-being-reliable-is-not-a-winning-career-strategy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of the most common questions I hear when I talk to people about their careers goes something like this:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;How come nobody cares about the work I'm doing? I&rsquo;m reliable, I&rsquo;m never late with my projects, and I hardly ever make mistakes. Meanwhile, people around me who aren&rsquo;t half as dependable as I am, keep getting all the promotions. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> This one hurts my heart a little bit. So many people feel this way and frankly they deserve so much more than they get. If reliability and consistency were the stepping stones to success they would be at the top. They&rsquo;re dependable, smart and hardworking. But it isn&rsquo;t enough. It almost never is.</p><p> Whether it feels fair or not, we have to take an honest assessment about what it really takes to advance your career in a corporation. And having spent many years studying success factors from the competent and incompetent alike, I can say with great confidence, and more than a little regret, that being reliable is just not enough to advance your career. At least not to the executive level. </p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s why: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Reliability is a passive career management strategy that will not bring you the visibility required to make it to the top. </strong> Contrary to conventional logic, a career strategy based on consistency and small victories is actually higher risk than one based on big wins and major projects. Many of us like to think we will be noticed for consistently solid work. But in practice consistency is only enough to provide career security. Career advancement demands more.  </p><p> <strong>  To advance your career you have to put points up on the board. </strong> Points, in your career, like in football or rugby, come in a couple of varieties. Consistently delivering against your responsibilities and doing solid work in your day to day tasks wins you lots of small points. We&rsquo;ll call them career field goals. And if you never make any mistakes, those points accumulate over time &ndash; slowly. On the flip side, when you inevitably do make mistakes you lose points too. The problem is, in my experience, one career mistake is worth at least five career field goals. So it can be a challenge even for very reliable people to build up enough points using the field goal strategy to put a winning score up on the board in the end. </p><p> On the other hand, recognition for being associated with a big project gets you big points. We&rsquo;ll call them career touchdowns. If you&rsquo;re actively looking for them you&rsquo;ll see that opportunities for career touchdowns present themselves all the time. They often don&rsquo;t directly impact your personal objectives and it will frequently look like there isn&rsquo;t much to gain from all the extra work you&rsquo;ll have to do by taking them on. You should do it anyways. Because like in football and rugby, even if you score a lot of field goals, your opponent is always only one or two touchdowns away from catching or surpassing you. </p><p> An effective career strategy has to be about scoring touchdowns. It&rsquo;s about big plays and projects.  While playing a safe, consistent game will keep you employed and keep your boss happy, it&rsquo;s an extremely difficult strategy to actually win with. As you&rsquo;ve no doubt experienced a few times in your own career, a less competent opponent can beat you with a few lucky touchdowns even if you&rsquo;re more reliable on a day to day basis. </p><p> To break from the metaphor for a moment, <strong>  the only people who are paying attention to the reliability of your daily work are your direct teammates and your boss. </strong> This is almost never enough to get you a promotion. At least not after you&rsquo;ve reached a senior management level in your career. To get promoted you need recognition outside of your direct circle of influence. Mistakes by contrast, have a tendency to reverberate across an organization. Nobody will ever notice the twenty times you get the process right but the one time you mess it up, it will seem as though the entire company has been affected.</p><p> So what does this mean for your strategy? It starts with changing your personal career score card. Stop focusing on the consistency of your daily work as the number one priority and start seeking out opportunities to participate in big projects. It should go without saying this doesn&rsquo;t imply abandoning quality altogether &ndash; it&rsquo;s a matter of emphasis. You need to focus your time and energy on projects and initiatives that can actually put up enough points to beat your competitors.</p><p> If you want to learn more about this and other unconventional career strategies, check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Corner-Office-Strategies-Business/dp/1601633203\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stealing The Corner Office  </a> </u> .</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 21:28:31.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 21:28:31.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_l6StVmS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-being-reliable-is-not-a-winning-career-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"8688\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 21:28:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 21:28:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-being-reliable-is-not-a-winning-career-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8687\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4121\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Being-Reliable-is-Not-a-Winning-Career-Strategy-.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"701\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453312800,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}

I helped build a product to transform consumers lives but one meant to reach them through the bank as the best channel, so I have intimately grown to know many bellies of many beasts, so #BankBashing always meets with an eye roll from me when one of my fellow commentators reaches for it, as it&rsquo;s the eternal obvious, easy to sing, villain song, but with all that disclaimer I&rsquo;ve decided to get my &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with the banks&rdquo; article out of the way early this year not for populist reasons but because I believe I&rsquo;ve boiled down what my top reasons as to why they deserve to &ldquo;go and&hellip;. love&rdquo; themselves (to quote a popular song).</p><p> <strong>  Because they are self-loathing  </strong></p><p> &ldquo;My many weaknesses are beginning to show their heads. I simply must get this thing out of my system. I&rsquo;m not a writer. I&rsquo;ve been fooling myself and other people. I wish I were. This success will ruin me as sure as hell. It probably won&rsquo;t last, and that will be all right. I&rsquo;ll try to go on with work now. Just a stint every day does it. I keep forgetting.&rdquo; &ndash;  John Steinbeck&rsquo;s private diaries</p><p> Many argue banks are not even remotely as angst ridden as they should be but I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s the case, insecurity is paralysing and paralysis is the last we need. If anything, they are too quick to repent after the Occupy Wall Street moments.</p><p> The argument is that banks are organisations who, for very little effort as compared to their counterparts in retail, have achieved enormous amounts of fame and money in a short interval of time. That it&rsquo;s underserved. That they were dishonest about it and that bankers got fat bonuses for no reason. Banks seem to be self-aware and readily critical enough to agree.</p><p> Yes, banks are organisationally the fraud we think they are, but if you won it all and think you don&rsquo;t deserve it and it will all end at some point &ndash; what would you think if someone came and said you need to change, to do better, or others will win? Ready for action or willing to hang on to your chair, not move and not breathe until the ship sinks?</p><p> <strong>  Because they lost their religion </strong></p><p> They meant well one day a long, long,  <strong>  LONG </strong>  time ago, didn&rsquo;t they?</p><p> The branch manager listening to Trudi&rsquo;s dream of taking Gary on that promised cruise before he passes, was compassionate and concerned with how to make it happen not calculating if a remortgage is more profitable to the bank and his sales bonus than a consumer loan.</p><p> The guys designing those ghastly first websites knew they weren&rsquo;t to replace that bank manager but may save people a call or a trip to the bank. The execs we can never find the names of these days all started wanting to change the world one way or another did they not?</p><p> And then everyone individually and the bank collectively lost their religion.</p><p> Likely at the end of countless yet emotionally costly personal lost battles, yes, but lost it nonetheless.</p><p> Bankers are still humans who want to do well and want to do well now but in banks their ability to achieve any instant gratification plays out internally easier through abject office politics than it does externally in changes to consumers.</p><p> <strong>  Because they create human tragedies </strong></p><p> Have you ever heard a banker answer direct questions about whether consumers want X or need Y and whether others &ndash; challengers or big established digital banks are a real threat? You should. It&rsquo;s a feast of inconsistency and self-contradiction in multiple sound bites.</p><p> &ldquo;Oh please, as if consumers even want X!&rdquo;;</p><p> &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t measure if they need Y, we don&rsquo;t have the back-end to get that data!&rdquo;;</p><p> &ldquo;We know just how bad the mobile app is but without changing all our systems we can&rsquo;t do any better&rdquo;;</p><p> &ldquo;No one would trust Z with their data!&rdquo;;</p><p> &ldquo;Why would W even want to enter banking?!? There&rsquo;s no money in it!&rdquo;;</p><p> &ldquo;New banks have it so easy, ah if we could start one tomorrow we&rsquo;d make it rock!&rdquo;</p><p> I could go on. It&rsquo;s a mishmash of excuses and self soothing internal jargon delivered with either theatrical passion or staggered words depending on how good an actor the banker is. Yes, it&rsquo;s an act because no matter how we want to vilify tens of thousands of people working in the industry, we can never dispute their level of intelligence and that level sadly ensures that in the back of their minds, they are aware these arguments are intensely intellectually disingenuous and that, is a tragedy.</p><p> Tolstoi himself could write a novel about the tragedies of the Frustrated Innovation Manager, the Used-to-Care Head of IT and the Ex-Dreamer Director of Digital Strategy. Maybe call it &ldquo;The PNL of Love/Hate&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  Because they don&rsquo;t praise and foster BB&amp;H </strong></p><p> Wars, world hunger, intolerance, global warming. This is a potentially exhaustive list of things banks are not responsible for. What&rsquo;s NOT their fault.</p><p> Mobile apps being sluggish and serving no real need beyond a skewed, and nonsensical view of one&rsquo;s balance, antiquated back-ends causing online blackouts when customers most need their money, having built products consumers have to try and mould their needs into, instead of seamlessly fitting into the rhythm of their lives, the subprime crisis and most of world&rsquo;s economical issues are all, sadly, the bank&rsquo;s fault but if you sum up the above the one thing I hold them responsible for, the one thing they could change within the blink of an eye with enough good will and passion is: culture.</p><p> I wrote about this before. What I passionately believe will save banking is not new and innovative technology, it&rsquo;s people. The right people with their B(rains)B/C(ourage)&amp;H(earts) uncompromisingly on display for others to see and grow theirs in turn.</p><p> Banks do need to start loving themselves enough to give themselves a serious shake-up and breath new life into their journey.

{"original_id":3973,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Customer Experience - Fact or Fiction?","link":"customer-experience-fact-or-fiction","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Over the last few years, many experienced business people all over the world have been working hard to create, nurture and develop a brand new profession. Whilst organisations have always delivered experiences, it is only now that most are starting to recognise the importance of them. However&hellip;there is usually one of those&hellip;there are still A LOT of people who DO NOT recognise Customer Experience &ndash; either as something of significant importance to business strategy OR as a profession at all.</p><p> As a practitioner on the inside and a consultant on the outside &ndash; I, like my peers have fought very hard to get Customer Experience the recognition it needs&hellip;.it deserves. In my experience, there are three main behaviours displayed by organisations that almost see Customer Experience more as &lsquo;fiction&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;fact&rsquo; &ndash; those behaviours are:</p><p> <strong>  1. &lsquo;The Know It All&rsquo; </strong>  &ndash; this type of company does not think it needs to &lsquo;do&rsquo; Customer Experience because &lsquo;we already do it&rsquo;; or &lsquo;we do not need to do it&rsquo;. Often, led by business leaders who believe that their organisation is already customer centric&rsquo;, there is little recognition of the need for any skills or competencies badged as &rsquo;Customer Experience&rsquo;.</p><p> <strong>  2. &lsquo;The Confused&rsquo; </strong>  &ndash; increasingly, I am coming across organisations that are just confused by Customer Experience. They often think that CX is a &lsquo;project or an initiative&rsquo; that will &lsquo;cost money&rsquo; and are likely to have a lack of ownership or governance from the very top. It is possible that different groups of people are all trying to do CX related activities that are not aligned. The more confused they become, the more common it is for CX to be passed over for &lsquo;the next big thing&rsquo;.</p><p> <strong>  3. &lsquo;The Incompetent&rsquo; </strong>  &ndash; whilst &lsquo;incompetent&rsquo; is a very strong word, consider this more from the perspective of a business that does &lsquo;not possess the competencies&rsquo; to drive an approach to CX. The &lsquo;incompetent&rsquo; business is actually one that may well have come to the conclusion that CX is something that is critical to the sustainable future of the organisation, but just does not have the skills &ndash; the competencies &ndash; to know exactly how to do it.</p><p> Whilst I acknowledge that these three behaviour &lsquo;types&rsquo; are extremely broad, they roughly represent what I see across the globe. They also demonstrate why it is so important for CX to be recognised as a PROFESSION &ndash; for the world to recognise that CX is not some fictional business fad, but a genuine, fact based professional occupation.</p><p> Since 2012, the  <u>  Customer Experience Professionals Association (CXPA) </u>  has been flying the flag for all those who work in the field of CX. Never before had there been a global body to represent people like me &ndash; a group of experienced specialists whose major interest is to continually develop their specialism and educating the business world as to the benefits CX Professionals can bring to the party.</p><p> In 2014, the CXPA launched the first ever Professional Qualification in CX &ndash; yes&hellip;..that is right&hellip;..professional qualification. For the very first time, people who possess internationally recognised skills and competencies to tangibly and demonstrably improve customer experience were able to get accreditation to show their authority to the world. The qualification &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ccxp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CCXP (Certified Customer Experience Professional)  </a> </u>  &ndash; is (as one recent CCXP was quoted as saying) reassuringly difficult to achieve. It is because to become a CCXP you MUST possess the knowledge AND experience of utilising and applying a set of core competencies.</p><p> The competencies that a CCXP is expected to have experiential knowledge of are as follows:</p><li> Customer Centric Culture</li><li> Customer Experience Strategy</li><li> Voice of Customer, Customer Insight and Understanding</li><li> Metrics, Measurement and ROI</li><li> Organisational Adoption and Accountability</li><li> Experience Design, Improvement and Innovation <br/>  </li><p> These are not fictional &lsquo;text book&rsquo; type subject areas &ndash; these competencies contain a plethora of tools, techniques and concepts that will enable an experience, callable practitioner to guide an organisation on its &lsquo;never ending&rsquo; customer centric journey.</p><p> In 2015, I worked with many practitioners aspiring to become a CCXP &ndash; they are all finding it challenging &ndash; some more than others. There is a growing realisation to some of the practitioners that they have GAPS in their knowledge &ndash; and competencies that require development. This only further highlights the need for something like CCXP &ndash; an international qualification based on internationally recognised competencies.</p><p> In 2016, there are still TOO MANY organisations who are yet to fully COMMIT to Customer Experience &ndash; they have a lack of leadership; governance; emotion; and knowledge on how to become more customer centric. To address these significant challenges, they must START talking about Customer Experience as though they really mean it. Yet they must not just TALK about it &ndash; they need to start actually DOING it. That is where CX as fiction becomes CX as FACT.</p><p> The best way to stop CX from being fiction is to ensure that your business has the skills and competencies it needs to turn CX into FACT. If you have colleagues in the business who do not understand what CX is &ndash; you need to EDUCATE them.

Only 38% of those who had been in a previous partnership that &ldquo;ended badly&rdquo; report having worked with their current partner prior to joining forces. This is slightly lower than for those in first partnerships.</p><p> Working together before taking the leap into a partnership is one of the most important steps that prospective partners can take. Here is a reminder of the top three things that potential partners should do to prevent being part of the grim 70% failure rate for business partnerships:</p><h3> 1. Work together first.</h3><p> <br/> We cannot stress this enough. Experience tells us that nothing helps to build the critical trust and respect for your partner, and them for you, than working together before becoming partners.  Seeing how your potential partner solves problems builds confidence for the inevitable tough times that your business will face.  Conversely, partnerships based on professional acquaintance or personal relationships have a much harder time when problems arise.</p><h3> 2. Get a formal assessment of your partnership dynamics.</h3><p> <br/> Such assessments (DISC, Talent Analytics, for example) are relatively inexpensive and can provide important insights into your compatibility as partners.  We have found that exceptional partners engage in formal assessments much more often than those who are in less-successful partnerships.</p><p> When a business partnership ends badly it is often due to unpleasant surprises about the actions or attitudes of a partner.  Having formal assessments raises awareness about the behavior of partners and how close (or not) the partners&rsquo; core values are.  These are things that often surface after the &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; period and can cause havoc in a partnership.</p><h3> 3. Make effective communication a priority.</h3><p> <br/> Even when partners recognize that a communication breakdown was a factor in a past failed partnership, often they do not take steps to make sure it does not happen again in a new partnership.  Good communication seems like something that should just happen with people who have a shared vision, but it doesn&rsquo;t. The assessments (see #2!) can provide information about the most effective ways to communicate with each other and help devise a good communication plan.</p><p> In 1791, English poet Samuel Johnson referred to second marriages as &ldquo; <strong>  the triumph of hope over experience. </strong> &rdquo;  Unfortunately, second marriages have a lower success rate than first marriages, but we can do better in second business partnerships, if we learn from our mistakes.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-19 21:56:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-19 21:56:01.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_GRkhEqd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/learning-from-partnership-failures/\", \"post_id\": \"8695\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-19 21:56:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-19 21:56:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"learning-from-partnership-failures\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8694\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4125\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Learning-from-Partnership-Failures.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"954\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453287600,"author_id":478,"chart_url":""}

It tells you the dollar value of a country or region&rsquo;s goods and services over a specific time period. But GDP&rsquo;s like looking in the rearview mirror, in that it shows you where you&rsquo;ve been and little more. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;blind&rdquo; to what&rsquo;s ahead of you.</p><p> For that you need another indicator, and if you&rsquo;re a regular reader of the Investor Alert or  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/subscribe/FTSubscribe.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Frank Talk, </a>  my CEO blog, you probably know which one I&rsquo;m referring to: the purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI).</p><p> Unlike GDP, the PMI forecasts future manufacturing conditions and activity by assessing forward-looking factors such as production levels, new orders and supplier deliveries. PMI, then, is like the high beams that help guide you at night through the twists and turns of a mountain road.</p><p> Several times in the past, we&rsquo;ve shown that there&rsquo;s a high correlation between the global PMI reading and the performance of commodities and energy three months later.

Such rules have gunked up the gears of industry, and it&rsquo;s essential that they be cleaned out to ignite synchronized global growth.</p><p> It&rsquo;s hard to overemphasize just how important the American manufacturing sector is to the national (and world) economy. According to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), manufacturing has the highest multiplier effect and drives more innovation than any other sector. For every $1 spent on manufacturing, $1.40 is created and pumped back into the U.S. economy. The sector employs more than 12 million Americans, or roughly 9 percent of the workforce, and supports more than 18 million additional jobs.</p><p> If it were its own country, American manufacturing would be the ninth largest in the world.</p><p> And yet the cost of federal regulations falls disproportionately on manufacturers, who pay an average $19,500 per worker in compliance costs&mdash;about $10,000 more than what other industries must pay on average.</p><p> George Mason University&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://mercatus.org/publication/regulation-and-productivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mercatus Center  </u>  , </a>  a free market think tank, studied the effects of federal regulations on the productivity of various industries between 1997 and 2010. Unsurprisingly, the group found that the most regulated industries experience the least amount of growth. Whereas output per person for lightly regulated companies grew 63 percent during the period, output grew only 33 percent for those that carry heavier regulatory burdens.</p><p> More rules means less productivity and efficiency. As an analogy, imagine if professional basketball were played with more referees than players on the court, and with more rules than anyone can remember. No one would be able to score!

Two tankers have already departed from Corpus Christi, Texas, to deliver crude to Europe. In anticipation of the policy change, infrastructure companies have poured billions into building new pipelines and oil storage facilities and expanding loading capacity at ports.</p><img alt=\"TPP Expected to Increase Member Countries' GDPs, Exports and Imports\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/COMM-TPP-expected-to-increase-member-countries-GDPs-exports-and-imports-01152016.png\"/><p> That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m excited for Congress to ratify the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/how-these-12-tpp-nations-could-forever-change-global-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),  </a> </u>  which was finally settled upon in October by the 12 participating nations, the U.S. and Canada included. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been writing and speaking extensively about the TPP, yet I can&rsquo;t seem to emphasize enough how vital the passage of this landmark free-trade agreement is for global economic growth and job creation.</p><p> Once ratified, 18,000 tariffs are expected to be eliminated among the 12 TPP nations, which together account for 40 percent of global GDP and 20 percent of global trade. The World Bank estimates that individual GDPs will rise between 0.4 and 10 percent by 2030 as a direct result of the TPP.</p><h3> Could 2016 Be Gold&rsquo;s Turnaround Year?</h3><p> <br/> As the Periodic Table of Commodity Returns above indicates, gold has seen annual losses for the past three years.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.19 percent. The S&amp;P 500 Stock Index fell 2.17 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.34 percent. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost 3.68 percent this week.</li><li> The Hang Seng Composite lost 5.05 percent this week; while Taiwan was down 1.67 percent and the KOSPI fell 2.02 percent.</li><li> The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 8 basis points to 2.03 percent. <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/interactive/the-periodic-table-of-commodity-returns-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Uncocver the Patterns in Commodity Returns\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/banners/2015/PeriodicTableCommodities-IA-Banner-2015.jpg\"/> </a></p><h3> <strong>  Domestic Equity Market </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/DOM-SP-500-Economic-Sectors-01152016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"S&amp;P 500 Economic Sectors\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/DOM-SP-500-Economic-Sectors-01152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><h3> Strengths <br/>  </h3><li> Utilities were the strongest sector for the week trading up .70 percent and unfortunately it was the only place for equity investors to hide. </li><li>  The strongest performing stock for the week was Sempra Energy, rebounding from being oversold last week.  The company said it should be able to plug a leaking natural gas well before the end of February. <br/>  </li><h3> Weaknesses <br/>  </h3><li> The materials sector declined the most this week, falling 4.4 percent.</li><li> Freeport-McMoRan lost the most this week, and there seems to be several drivers for the company&rsquo;s decline. Most notable was Freeport&rsquo;s credit downgrade to BBB- from Fitch along with the possibility of being forced into an asset sale. <br/>  </li><h3> Opportunities <br/>  </h3><li> According to BCA Research, the S&amp;P telecommunications services sector traditionally outperforms during economic recessions and/or when overall profits contract. While the former is unlikely at this point, the latter is already underway. Industrial output growth will continue to sink, according to the bearish message from the ISM manufacturing survey.</li><li> Retail sales at toy stores are soaring at a time when the overall retail market is struggling. This acceleration in consumer spending on toys and games is inversely correlated, with a lag, with fuel prices.</li><li> Booming pharmaceutical drug demand should ensure that pharmacy foot traffic continues to grow. Pharmaceutical shipments have skyrocketed in the past few months. Given these trends, the defensive, growth-oriented S&amp;P retail drugstore index provides an entry point at a market forward P/E multiple for above market potential earnings growth. <br/>  </li><h3> Threats <br/>  </h3><li> Global semi-conductor sales are contracting, lagging well behind overall GDP growth. As a result, deflation pressures are intense.</li><li> According to BCA Research, prospective relative returns for the S&amp;P capital markets index are tilted heavily to the downside on the back of waning risk appetites.</li><li> Media companies are undergoing a fundamental shift in consumer media consumption habits. Several companies have already started warning that cord cutting could have a negative impact on profit results. <br/> <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Economy and Bond Market </strong></h3><p>  </p><h3> Strengths <br/>  </h3><li> Consumer sentiment in the U.S. rose in January to a seven-month high, according to the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Consumer Sentiment Index.  At 93.3, sentiment surpassed analysts&rsquo; expectations of 92.9. </li><li> Amid the risk-off rout in global equity markets this week, bond prices rose significantly as yields declined, almost across the board, in developed markets.  The yield on the U.S. two-year Treasury fell to levels last seen in early November, more than retracing its rise into and following the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s December rate hike.</li><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/BND-two-year-treasury-yield-drops-to-pre-hike-levels-01152016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Two-Year Treasury Yield Drops to Pre-Hike Levels\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/BND-two-year-treasury-yield-drops-to-pre-hike-levels-01152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><h3> Weaknesses <br/>  </h3><li> Highly correlated selloffs in global equity markets this week speak to broad concerns of slower global growth, ongoing deflationary fears and policy uncertainties internationally.  The week saw multiple indices, including the broad European equity Stoxx 600 Index and the Shanghai Composite Index, enter technical bear markets.  Questions over growth prospects prompted several large brokerage houses to reassess fourth-quarter U.S. GDP estimates, even as analysts brace for China&rsquo;s fourth-quarter GDP release over the holiday weekend in the U.S.</li><li> The Empire State Manufacturing Index came in today at -19.37, considerably weaker than expectations for only -4.00, and marking new multi-year lows.  December data was revised lower as well, adding fuel to the fire on a day already wracked by risk-off sentiment.</li><li> Initial jobless claims in the U.S. ticked up this week to 284,000, short of expectations for 275,000. <br/>  </li><h3> Opportunities <br/>  </h3><li> Investors should not overreact to alarming headlines about China selling Treasuries, as private-sector buying in the U.S. is more than offsetting official Chinese selling. That is why longer dated Treasury yields have remained flat, even as China&rsquo;s stock of U.S. treasuries has decreased. Furthermore, additional weakness in the Chinese currency can eventually be bond bullish, to the extent that it acts to tighten U.S. monetary conditions via a stronger dollar.</li><li> According to BCA Research, it would be a mistake to think that the economy is about to go off the rails. While inflation expectations have come down in recent months, they remain well above 2010 levels. Wage growth has also picked up, and with the job openings-to-applicants ratio at its highest level since 1992, further gains are likely. Crucially, many of the forces that have contributed to deflation, such as falling property prices and corporate deleveraging, have abated. Real estate prices are rising in most cities and Japanese corporations are sitting on more cash than their entire stock market capitalization.</li><li> In comments filed in the U.S. International Trade Commission&rsquo;s official review of the Trans-Pacific Partnership&rsquo;s (TPP&rsquo;s) impact on the overall U.S. economy, the Progressive Policy Institute highlighted the beneficial economic effects of the TPP&rsquo;s groundbreaking provisions on small business trade, international e-commerce and the digital economy. <br/>  </li><h3> Threats <br/>  </h3><li> High-yield corporate bond stress could have unintended consequences because of the prevalence of \"go anywhere,\" fixed-income funds that stretched for yield in recent years. Fund redemptions and retail selling of ETFs could spur self-fulfilling liquidation.</li><li> Politics are becoming a headwind to risk assets in both Europe and the U.S. as populism ascends.</li><li> The combination of Chinese equity/currency weakness and Fed hawkishness triggered the sharp, across-the-board selloff in risk assets last August, and the past week seems like a repeat performance, especially for currencies. Concerns about China and the Fed continue to pose material downside risks to the global economy and risk assets. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Gold Market </strong></h3><p> <br/> This week spot gold closed at $1,089.03, down $15.02 per ounce, or 1.36 percent. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, fell 9.63 percent.  Junior miners outperformed seniors for the week as the S&amp;P/TSX Venture Index traded down 5.00 percent.  The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar Index gained 0.38 percent this past week.</p>DateEventSurveyActualPriorJan-14U.S. Initial Jobless Claims275k284k277kJan-15U.S. PPI Final Demand YoY-1.0%1.0%-1.1%Jan-18China Retail Sales YoY11.3%--11.2%Jan-19Germany CPI YoY0.3%--0.9%Jan-19Eurozone CPI Core YoY0.9%--0.9%Jan-19Germany ZEW Survey Current Situation53.1--55.0Jan-19Germany ZEW Survey Expectations7.9--16.1Jan-20U.S. Housing Starts1200k--1173kJan-20U.S. CPI YoY0.8%--0.5%Jan-21Eurozone ECB Main Refinancing Rate0.050%--0.050%Jan-21U.S. Initial Jobless Claims280k--284k<p>  </p><h3> Strengths <br/>  </h3><p>  </p><li> In a down week for most markets, silver fared the best, falling only 0.11 percent.  There was no particular story supporting the move, but note that silver really didn&rsquo;t fully participate in the precious metal rally last week and perhaps had less to lose.</li><li> Over the past five days investors bought 26.8 metric tonnes of bullion through exchange-traded products backed by the metal, according to Bloomberg, the most since January 2015 as seen in the chart below. In addition, Reuters says gold and silver demand is off the charts; the U.S. Mint sold nearly as much gold on the first day of 2016 as in all of January 2015, with silver sales equally as astounding. <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/GLD-gold-attracts-cash-in-market-turmoil-01152016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold Attracts CAsh in Market Turmoil\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/GLD-gold-attracts-cash-in-market-turmoil-01152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><li> HSBC believes that gold has &ldquo;shrugged off&rdquo; two bearish developments, a strong dollar and weaker commodity prices, announcing that they remain bullish on the precious metal. The group sees good emerging market demand, eventual dollar declines and central bank accumulation helping gold this year. As reported by Bloomberg, the FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index, which rallied 20 percent this year, has had the best start since 1995. <br/>  </li><h3> Weaknesses <br/>  </h3><li> Platinum faced the worst losses this week with a 5.75 percent price decline.  Price action seemed to track the falling equity markets but in countries like South Africa and Russia, which have had falling local currencies, the incentive to continue producing remains attractive.</li><li> Rubicon Minerals is having a rough start to the year, tumbling nearly 80 percent for the week, after a revised new resource estimate showed a significant decrease in metric tons and ounces compared to a 2013 report. Similarly, Royal Gold extended its drop (24.5 percent for the week) after an update on its Phoenix Gold Project, and Eldorado Gold tumbled 29.85 percent due to &ldquo;Greek mining woes,&rdquo; as reported by Bloomberg.</li><li> The controversial Pebble Mine project, a proposed gold mine near Alaska&rsquo;s Bristol Bay, was deemed an environmental risk by the Environmental Protection Agency which is moving toward a formal decision to bar mining operations there. The EPA, however, was questioned on its &ldquo;misuse of authority,&rdquo; according to the Washington Post, and now the group&rsquo;s internal watchdog has announced there is &ldquo;no evidence of bias in the agency&rsquo;s efforts.&rdquo; Critics who have followed the EPA&rsquo;s review process noted that the EPA investigator did not consider a significant body of publically available information brought to light by the Congressional Science Committee that demonstrates clear instances of bias and predetermination. <br/>  </li><h3> Opportunities <br/>  </h3><li> Evercore ISI took a look at sectors they believe are candidates for being &ldquo;exalted&rdquo; in 2016, meaning those that have underperformed over the past several years, but could now perform in excess of their index. Of these &ldquo;exalted&rdquo; industries, gold makes the list. Jeremy Wrathall of Investec is quoted this week in Mineweb reinforcing ISI&rsquo;s annual rotation picks, stating &ldquo;we will see a very different mining industry in 12 months&rsquo; time&hellip;those who haven&rsquo;t got debt will reshape the industry.&rdquo;</li><li> In its Technical Outlook 2016, UBS writes that the seven-year cycle in equities is rolling over and now it&rsquo;s time to &ldquo;buy gold.&rdquo; The group warns investors not to be surprised by &ldquo;record spikes in volatility over the next 12 to 17 months.&rdquo; Adding to UBS&rsquo; rhetoric, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is quoted in Bloomberg this week saying that &ldquo;risks are substantially tilted to the downside,&rdquo; when it comes to global commodity and stock markets.</li><li> Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital and one of the first to predict the oil price crash in 2014, thinks that gold could surge this year. Gundlach believes that as investors look for safe haven assets in a volatile market, the precious metal could &ldquo;soon climb&rdquo; 30 percent higher from its current price, according to an article on StreetTalk. <br/>  </li><h3> Threats <br/>  </h3><li> Gold demand in India could take a hit this year as farmers are likely to reduce buying on account of a poor crop production this season, according to a CommodityOnline article. This could also mean that gold demand will see a dent during wedding season. Experts predict a 10 to 15 percent dip in purchases this year.</li><li> According to Pranabesh Ray of the Xavier School of Management (during a conference on e-waste this week), 50 pounds of gold and 20,000 pounds of copper could be extracted from one million discarded cell phones if processed properly. &ldquo;E-waste,&rdquo; which comprises precious metals like gold and silver, can produce more gold than what is obtained through mining, according to a Bloomberg article recapping the conference.</li><li> Bullion may drop to around $995 per ounce in the fourth quarter, according to Societe General&rsquo;s Asia Head of Commodities Research Mark Keenan. During a Bloomberg TV interview this week Keenan reminded viewers that SoGen has been bearish on gold for some time. <br/> <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Energy and Natural Resources Market </strong></h3><p>  </p><h3> Strengths <br/>  </h3><li> Gold posted its biggest gain in six weeks on falling equity markets after investors lost confidence in Chinese authorities&rsquo; efforts to stimulate the market. U.S. equities tested the August 2015 lows on disappointing retails sales growth, giving way to gold to outperform based on its safe haven status.</li><li> The best performing sector for the week was integrated oil. Despite oil prices collapsing to lows not seen since 2003, major integrated names held up better than other resources sectors, owing to their more robust balance sheets which allow them to weather the downturn for longer.</li><li> The best performing stock for the week in the broader natural resource space was Cal-Maine Foods Inc., the largest producer of eggs in the U.S., as investors expect egg prices to inch higher following the confirmed presence of a new breakout of avian influenza in Indiana. <br/>  </li><h3> Weaknesses <br/>  </h3><li> U.S. oil production rose to 9.23 million barrels per day last week, a fresh four-month high with VTB Capital reporting that lenders are pushing producers to maximize output to keep-up interest payments, even when losses continue to mount. According to the Wall Street Journal, it is estimated North American oil and gas companies are losing nearly $2 billion every week at current prices.</li><li> The worst performing sector for the week were major miners after signs of a slowdown in China sent copper down sharply, to a fresh six-year low. The weakness intensified after BHP announced a major write-down, leading investors to question the sustainability of the high dividends in the space.</li><li> The worst performing stock for the week in the S&amp;P Global Natural Resources Index was First Quantum. The Canadian-listed copper miner slumped as copper prices fell below $2 per pound as weaker demand in China is met with excess supplies. <br/>  </li><h3> Opportunities <br/>  </h3><li> The recent selloff in the refining space should be seen as a buying opportunity. According to Raymond James analysts, the chart below highlights how similar this year&rsquo;s refining performance has been to 2015, with refining stocks setting lows in mid-January before rallying through much of the year. Further to this, gasoline crack spreads have remained at double-digits in January, implying higher profitability for the space than at this same time last year. <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/ENGY-january-seasonal-patterns-provide-attractive-entry-point-for-refiners-01152016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"January Seasonal Patterns Provide Attractive Entry Point for Refiners\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/ENGY-january-seasonal-patterns-provide-attractive-entry-point-for-refiners-01152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><li> China commodity imports rose to near-record highs in December as prices for raw materials weakened to their lowest prices since 2008. Data showed oil imports rose 9.3 percent, a new record high, while copper imports increased 9.3 percent to the second highest reading on record. While some of the growth has been attributed to strategic stockpiling, it may also suggest better demand from the world&rsquo;s biggest consumer.</li><li> The long-term outlook for oil supply and demand has improved, as Wood Mackenzie estimates 68 major projects worth an expected 27 billion barrels of oil were cancelled during 2015. Furthermore, the consultancy company estimates the average breakeven costs for major projects sits at $60 per barrel thus making it unlikely for the new projects to be initiated under current prices. <br/>  </li><h3> Threats <br/>  </h3><li> BHP Billiton, a leading mining and energy company, booked a $7.2 billion write down on the value of its U.S. shale assets, as it accounts for major declines in oil and gas prices. The write down sparked fears that most other major mining and energy companies could be forced to reassess their reserves and resources at lower commodity prices, which could trigger a sequence of write downs in the space.</li><li> Crude prices fell to fresh lows this week on prospects of Iran quickly increasing oil export volumes to an already oversupplied market. The sanctions on Iran could be lifted as soon as next week, opening the way for an additional 500,000 barrels per day to hit the markets almost immediately.</li><li> Soybean margins have slumped to the lowest level in more than two years as a record U.S. harvest flooded the market. Fertilizers have also seen price declines as weaker farmer economics limit demand growth for agricultural chemicals. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  China Region </strong></h3><p>  </p><h3> Strengths <br/>  </h3><li> The Indonesian rupiah held up well this week, strengthening by 0.38 percent.  The Jakarta Composite Index is among the strongest in the region over the last quarter.</li><li> After largescale intervention by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) in foreign exchange markets to try to stabilize the yuan earlier in the week, the Chinese government backed off toward the end of the week, which may have avoided roiling markets further.</li><li> Wynn Resorts Ltd. rose about 13 percent in U.S. trading today after the casino operator reported better than expected results.  Macao earnings at Wynn came in ahead of estimates, and may be a sign of better things to come for Macao. <br/>  </li><h3> Weaknesses <br/>  </h3><li> The Shanghai Composite Index entered a technical bear market&mdash;for the second time in a year&mdash;and finished the week with its lowest close in more than 52 weeks.  The Hang Seng Composite Index made new 52 week lows. <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/CHI-shanghai-composite-index-slides-01152016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Shanghai Composite Index Slides\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-15/CHI-shanghai-composite-index-slides-01152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><li> New loans for December in China came in much weaker than expected, at only 598 billion yuan versus much higher analyst expectations of 700 billion yuan.</li><li> The Hong Kong dollar weakened by 40 basis points this week, and while investors may not fear Hong Kong&rsquo;s ability to maintain its longstanding peg to the U.S. dollar in the near future, the foreign exchange movement garnered attention as a possible sign of capital outflows from the Chinese mainland, which could itself distressingly signal a potentially-diminished ability of the PBOC to stabilize the yuan going forward. <br/>  </li><h3> Opportunities <br/>  </h3><li> China will release its fourth quarter GDP data on Monday. Analyst expectations are for 6.9 percent, in line with China&rsquo;s third quarter GDP number. A decent GDP print may lead Chinese markets to bounce in relief.</li><li> The people of Taiwan will go to the polls tomorrow and vote on whether the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen will become Taiwan&rsquo;s first female leader. Tsai Ing-wen is pitted against the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party&rsquo;s Eric Chu, who is the mayor of New Taipei City.  While the DPP officially supports independence from China, the KMT has maintained closer ties to the Chinese mainland. In any case, the Taiwanese market and people should soon have some resolution. </li><li> The rapidity and scale of the recent global selloff means that numerous equities markets are heavily oversold in the very short term, and may present opportunity for a regional rebound. <br/>  </li><h3> Threats <br/>  </h3><li> Investor chatter and expectations of possible forthcoming stimulus from the Chinese government may make for expectations that run too high, and could be easily disappointed.  Largescale foreign exchange intervention by the PBOC, another technical bear market for Shanghai, and a recent global equities rout may collectively mean that additional negative news or missed expectations weigh more heavily upon markets, especially in China, where the Shanghai Composite is now sitting precariously upon its 52 week lows.</li><li> Jakarta suffered a terrorist attack this week in which multiple people were killed and several handfuls more were wounded.  That ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack raises more concern about the expanding reach of that sinister group.</li><li> Taiwanese election results might yield significant potential changes in Taiwanese government policy, the effects of which may not be anticipated fully. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Emerging Europe </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> Strengths <br/>  </h3><li> Turkey was the best-performing market this week, gaining 64 basis points. The country revised up its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to 4.5 percent in 2016 and 5 percent in 2017. Its budget deficit should stand at 1.3 percent in 2016 and 1 percent in 2017.</li><li> The Hungarian forint was the best-performing currency this week, gaining 2.8 percent against the dollar. November&rsquo;s trade surplus data, just published by the Central Statistical Office, reached 673 million euros. Exports were up 6.5 percent year-on-year, and imports gained 7.7 percent in November year-on-year, in euro terms.</li><li> The utilities sector was the best-performing sector among Eastern European markets this week. <br/>  </li><h3> Weaknesses <br/>  </h3><li> Russia was the worst-performing market this week, losing 8 percent. The Russian Ministry of Economic Development revised down its outlook for 2016. Country GDP is expected to contract 0.8 percent instead of the earlier estimate of 0.7 percent growth. The revised outlook is based on the oil price assumption of $40 per barrel. Brent crude oil declined 15 percent in the past five days and closed below $30 per barrel.</li><li> The Ukrainian hryvnia was the worst-performing currency this week, losing 4.3 percent against the dollar. Conflict with Russia put pressure on the economy and currency.

{"original_id":3978,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Putting the \"I\" in Team: Be Inclusive of the Women in Your Workplace","link":"putting-the-i-in-team-be-inclusive-of-the-women-in-your-workplace","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The workplace still favors male employees.</h3><p> <br/> While certain industries are taking steps toward adjusting their cultures to be more inclusive of women, there are still some that don&rsquo;t seem to understand there&rsquo;s a problem. The technology field is one we&rsquo;ve talked about quite a bit, but female economists face similar problems.</p><p> Justin Wolfers discusses this issue in his article  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/upshot/when-teamwork-doesnt-work-for-women.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;When Teamwork Doesn&rsquo;t Work for Women.&rdquo; </a>  He says that many economists work at universities where professors must receive tenure to keep their jobs. Like other academics, this requires economists to conduct and publish research. While some of this research can be done individually, many economists work in groups. The problem is, women who work in groups rarely receive credit for their work, thus making it more difficult for them to earn tenure.</p><p> &ldquo;When women write with men, their tenure prospects don&rsquo;t improve at all. That is, women get essentially zero credit for the collaborative work with men,&rdquo; writes Wolfers. &ldquo;Papers written by women in collaboration with both a male and female co-author yield partial credit. It is only when women write with other women that they are given full credit.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, if there are multiple authors and if there is any question as to who the research belongs to, credit almost always goes to the male author involved in the research. Because economists need to be published to earn tenure, this is problematic for female economists. Wolfers talked to Heather Sarsons, a young economist who is publishing her dissertation on this subject. Sarsons notes that, because male economists receive more credit on team publications than women, &ldquo;Female economists are twice as likely to be denied tenure as their male colleagues.&rdquo;  </p><p> Although this article focuses on women studying economics, this could easily apply to any company that puts an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration. Are we being inclusive of women when they&rsquo;re on teams and committees with men? Are we listening to their ideas and giving them credit where credit is due?</p><h3> As inclusive leaders, it&rsquo;s our duty to answer these questions.</h3><p> <br/> We need to make sure that women and their ideas are taken seriously and respected by giving them credit for their work. They shouldn&rsquo;t have to take on the burden of an entire project only to have credit or compensation taken away. It&rsquo;s up to us to evaluate our workplace cultures and make sure that men are respectful of women&rsquo;s ideas. If women are more comfortable collaborating and sharing their ideas, then they&rsquo;ll likely have more opportunities to advance their careers, which only makes our businesses stronger.</p><p> Talk to the women in your office, and ask for their feedback on their experience working in teams. Much like Sarsons is trying to do with her research, we need to give women a voice to not only express their ideas, but we need them to express when things aren&rsquo;t working if we&rsquo;re to fix the problem at hand.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s time to put the &ldquo;i&rdquo; in team for inclusion. </strong> Listen to all of the voices on your team. Most importantly, make sure you're giving credit to the voices that deserve it!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-20 15:03:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-20 15:03:44.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_32RyrOc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/putting-the-i-in-team-be-inclusive-of-the-women-in-your-workplace/\", \"post_id\": \"8700\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-20 15:03:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-20 15:03:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"putting-the-i-in-team-be-inclusive-of-the-women-in-your-workplace\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8699\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4128\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Be-Inclusive-of-the-Women-in-Your-Workplace.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"503\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453399200,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}

Should I fire this person? Should I give them another chance? I just don't know what to do&hellip;\"</h3><p> <br/> I've had this conversation with so many people across so many different industries over the years. Why they choose to ask me for advice, I don't know. What I do know is that I should write my answer down.  </p><p> The conversation is nearly always the same, even though the details seldom are. What's relevant is that an employee has blatantly failed to deliver on their end of the employment contract - showing up and doing what they're paid to do. And yet here is their manager - the person asking me for advice - unsure of what to do. Fire the person and risk disrupting the team? Give the person (yet) another chance to show compassion and mentoring-intent? It's a difficult balancing act that rarely looks or feels graceful.</p><h3> My advice, ironically, takes the form of a question:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Has your employee irreparably breached your trust in them? Stated differently, can you forgive AND forget what's happened?! </strong></p><p> Wait, Kevin, you're probably thinking. They're the ones not doing their jobs. You're asking me if I can forgive and forget? How are MY trust issues the problem?! Well, it's simple, actually.</p><p> Imagine for a moment that you are able to compel your employee to change - maybe a little, maybe a lot. Doesn't really matter. Now fast-forward 6 months or 9 months or however far into the future and imagine that they slip-up. Will you go straight to,  \"Again?!\" As in, \"they're messing up again. I should have fired them X (days/weeks/months/years) ago?\" Because we all know they will eventually mess up again - hey, mistakes are just part of being human.</p><p> In that mistakes-were-made future moment, what happens then is decided by your trust issues, not their performance.  That problem employee can change - I've seen it happen. But their success is dependent upon your honesty with yourself because, if the trust is irreparably fractured now, you're just delaying the inevitable break that will happen in the future.</p><p> <strong>  Failure to be honest with yourself and your team about your Trust issues, no matter how well-intentioned, simply ensures there will be no happily ever after for you or your problem employee. </strong></p><p> So you see, the other person's failure to perform may be the catalyst. But its your honest appraisal of your own tolerance for a breach of trust that must ultimately inform your action, and decide whether they should have a chance to correct their course. </p><p> Agree? Disagree? What advice / guidance do you give about problem employees?

This is also a very smart collaboration for them and for the consumers who use Lyft. Although these organizations produce different products and services, they could visualize how they could support one another and grow their brands. It takes great leadership vision to see how working with someone else from an entirely different industry can be a growth opportunity and a win-win for both organizations.</p><p> The same thinking can be explored for each of us no matter where we work or whatever our field. We can ask ourselves: Who could we collaborate with this year to help us build our brand or career and at the same time help someone else grow too?</p><p> The collaboration journey doesn&rsquo;t stop there; it is just the beginning. Before inviting a person or company to join us at the table, we need to set ourselves up for success.</p><p> Here are 8 ways to lead your  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/10/26/five-ways-to-lead-a-collaboration/#sthash.QZzciVGi.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best collaboration  </a> </u>  ever:</p><h3> <strong>  1. RESEARCH THE BEST-FIT PARTNER </strong></h3><p> <br/> To locate a great person or organization to collaborate with can take research and patience. It is usually a good idea to find someone or some company that complements our skills. We should never be afraid of collaborating with a talented person, thinking they may outshine us. Just the opposite is true! When we work with gifted individuals or successful firms, we will create the best and most innovative products or services.</p><h3> <strong>  2. SET UP A MEETING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Oftentimes collaborations fail because not everyone affected is part of the initial decision-making. It is critical to reach out to all possible stakeholders to get their input and perspective. It could save you confusion down the line.</p><h3> <strong>  3. CREATE A CLEAR VISION TOGETHER </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once all the necessary players are in place, focus on developing a  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/06/08/four-ways-to-kick-into-leadership-hd/#sthash.himcGrwi.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   concise vision  </a> </u>  that meets the criteria for the collaboration.</p><li> Brainstorm a strong vision that shows purpose and direction</li><li> Decide on which values from each constituent should be included</li><li> If partnering with another department make sure to integrate the different department goals and dreams</li><li> If collaborating with another individual, give one another undivided attention and listen strategically to each other&rsquo;s suggestions</li><li> Try not to judge or use negative language <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  4. CHOOSE SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES </strong></h3><p> <br/> Assigning specific tasks to each person or organization is important so that all the steps are covered and each knows what is expected of them. This action, if not done with clarity, can derail a collaboration easily. Additionally, folding the process and procedures into the vision and direction is key.</p><h3> <strong>  5. ESTABLISH FEEDBACK AND CHECK-IN MECHANISMS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Mutually build in timeframes to get back to one another so that the collaboration stays on track.</p><li> How often do we want to present feedback?</li><li> What forum do we want to use?</li><li> Who should attend the  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/03/16/have-you-conducted-your-leadership-spring-tune-up/#sthash.s8S78Fao.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   check-ins  </a> </u> ? (This can change depending on the issues)</li><li> Should we send the updates and  information to each other ahead of time to think about? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  6. CHAMPION ONE ANOTHER </strong></h3><p> <br/> No matter how the collaboration goes down, it&rsquo;s important for the participants to support one another. Staying positive and optimistic is important. Also, many managers I work with in collaborations have shared the value in  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/blog/#sthash.FFhNBBQB.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   praising people  </u>    </a> for their hard work and contributions.</p><h3> <strong>  7. ALWAYS BE HONEST </strong></h3><p> <br/> If there isn&rsquo;t any honesty during a collaboration, there will never be a successful outcome. We need to stay open-minded but truthful in how we feel. If something doesn&rsquo;t seem right or sound right, we need to have the courage to speak up. There is no place for &ldquo;group thinking&rdquo; just to move things along. That type of mentality will merely lead to inaccurate or less than optimal results.</p><h3> <strong>  8.

{"original_id":3982,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Hand-Holding Rises to the Top of Advisers' Skill Sets","link":"hand-holding-rises-to-the-top-of-advisers-skill-sets","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@GlobeInvestor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dianne Maley  </a> </u></p><p> First published in <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Globe and Mail  </u> </a></p><h3> Being a financial adviser isn&rsquo;t easy. Their clients break down in tears, they find themselves dealing with daily panic attacks, they spend hours each week keeping investors calm. As the weight of their clients&rsquo; distress increases, some advisers might be feeling this is not the job they signed up for.</h3><p> <br/> Effective financial advisers need the same insight, perception and ability to deal with crises as a top psychologist, especially when clients are hurting and markets are down.</p><p> &ldquo;The psychology of it is amazing,&rdquo; says Kurt Rosentreter, an investment adviser and chartered accountant at Manulife Financial Corp. in Toronto. &ldquo;My day-to-day job is 80 per cent psychologist and 20 per cent money manager.&rdquo;</p><p> It begins with managing people&rsquo;s expectations but quickly goes beyond that, advisers say. &ldquo;Money is a personal thing, an emotional topic,&rdquo; Mr. Rosentreter says. &ldquo;It permeates everything.&rdquo;</p><p> Many retirees &ldquo;got the rug pulled out from under them&rdquo; by persistently low interest rates, he says. When the stock market goes down, they cancel vacations and put their spouse on a tight budget. &ldquo;It really can be all-consuming, destructive to people&rsquo;s personalities.&rdquo;</p><p> One way such misery can be avoided is by giving clients a steady source of income. When people retire after working for 30 years, their regular paycheques stop. &ldquo;That alone is a huge stress point. They can just freak out,&rdquo; Mr. Rosentreter says. A good adviser or planner will anticipate this and ensure clients are invested in such a way that they continue to get a regular cheque deposited to their bank account each month, no matter what the stock market does.</p><p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very conscientious about picking up where the paycheque stops and providing income,&rdquo; Mr. Rosentreter says.</p><p> Only then will he begin looking at portfolio construction, but even this can be fraught. New clients may be too proud to admit they cannot stand to lose money.</p><p> When markets turn down, &ldquo;people can be literally shaking,&rdquo; he says. He recalls a phone call from the daughter of a retired couple saying she was worried about her dad: &ldquo;&rsquo;He watches the market all day long, his head is three shades of red, even his doctor is worried about him,&rsquo;&rdquo; the daughter said.</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a powerful story and it happens more than you want to know,&rdquo; Mr. Rosentreter said. &ldquo;Unless clients share with their adviser how they really feel, we&rsquo;ll never get to the root cause of issues.&rdquo;</p><p> Often, clients are responding to their upbringing or other events in their lives, says Ngoc Day, a financial planner and portfolio manager at Macdonald, Shymko &amp; Co. Ltd., in Vancouver. &ldquo;It may not have anything to do with investment.&rdquo;</p><p> She tells of an elderly client, well off, who sincerely wanted to help her grandchildren through university but just couldn&rsquo;t part with the money. She and her late husband had grown up during the Depression and were extraordinarily careful with money.</p><p> In such cases, visual aids such as simple charts and graphs can help, Ms. Day says. &ldquo;Show her the numbers. Say, &lsquo;Look, you have more than enough to last your lifetime and beyond. Your grandchildren need help now. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see the fruit of your gift and enjoy it all your life rather than saying they&rsquo;re going to get it when you&rsquo;re gone?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> Sometimes, an adviser can help turn a sad situation around, says Marc Henein, an investment adviser at ScotiaMcLeod in Mississauga.</p><p> &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you how many people start crying in meetings,&rdquo; Mr. Henein said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big pain point. You have to figure out what it is and try to map out a solution. Ninety-eight per cent of the time it has nothing to do with money but with a life event.&rdquo;</p><p> A client might come in after inheriting $500,000 from her late mother. &ldquo;But she lost her mom and that sucks,&rdquo; he says. He might suggest she commit part of her inheritance to an insurance policy to make sure it is passed on to the next generation.</p><p> &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we create a legacy for your mom so her grandkids will see the benefit of their grandmother&rsquo;s hard work over the years?&rdquo; Mr. Henein says. One-hundred thousand dollars could buy a $500,000 life insurance policy that will pay out the same $500,000 to the grandchildren.</p><p> &ldquo;Then the survivor feels better,&rdquo; Mr. Henein says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all psychology.&rdquo;</p><p> Barbara Garbens, president of BL Garbens Associates Inc., a fee-only financial planning firm in Toronto, points to peoples&rsquo; &ldquo;money personalities,&rdquo; which are difficult to change.</p><h3> Some people can&rsquo;t save no matter how much they earn, while others are good at squirrelling money away.</h3><p> <br/> Many people put off financial planning because they are afraid of what they might discover, she says. If they are 55-ish and they want to retire at 60 or even sooner, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; Ms. Garbens says. All too often, their spending goals are unattainable.</p><p> &ldquo;I can see right away they won&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo; They sense this and feel anxious. &ldquo;They realize they&rsquo;re in trouble and have to make major life changes.&rdquo;</p><p> Lately, advisers have had to put on their psychologist hats to keep frightened clients from bailing out of the stock market. Retail investors are prone to buying high and selling low.</p><p> &ldquo;The role entails being a bit more of a counsellor of late,&rdquo; says Keith Davis, an investment adviser at TD Wealth in Kamloops, B.C. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s understandable with such a bombardment of negative news and panic. Investors worry, so they may look to make a quick decision,&rdquo; Mr. Davis says.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s times like these that advisers will prove their worth.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-20 17:12:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-20 17:12:38.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_b8O1IDp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/hand-holding-rises-to-the-top-of-advisers-skill-sets/\", \"post_id\": \"8708\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-20 17:12:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-20 17:12:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"hand-holding-rises-to-the-top-of-advisers-skill-sets\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8707\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4132\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Hand-Holding-Rises-to-the-Top-of-Advisers-Skill-Sets.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"934\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453409100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Don&rsquo;t you hate watching the taxi meter going up, knowing that every extra inch of the way is costing you?</p><p> Why do you hate this?</p><p> It&rsquo;s because of the pain you are suffering. Not physical pain of course, but rather activation of the same brain areas associated with physical pain.</p><p> Now, picture your client paying your hourly fee. Is it any different?</p><p> Spending money hurts. Literally.</p><p> Because your clients are not weighing their current gratification vs. future gratifications.

Do you think it would benefit the number of people you want to serve?</p><p> The question is: how?</p><h3> The Real Reason Why People Don&rsquo;t Buy Financial Planning <br/>  </h3><p> You see, when we experience pain, a certain region of our brain &ndash; the insular &ndash; lights up under a brain scan. And not only for physical pain. But also  psychological  pain.</p><p> So, what&rsquo;s psychological pain?</p><p> Well, for example,  spending money is.</p><p> It&rsquo;s what social scientists call the &ldquo;pain of paying&rdquo;. This is the unpleasantness associated with giving up our hard-earned cash, regardless of the circumstances. It turns out that the pain of paying has two interesting features.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions-ebook/dp/B002RI9QJE/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453157006&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=predictably+irrational\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Via Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely:  </a> </u></p><p> First, and most obviously, when we pay nothing we don&rsquo;t feel any pain of paying. Second, and less obviously, the pain of paying is relatively insensitive to the amount that we pay. This means that we feel more pain of paying as the bill increases, but every additional dollar on the bill pains us less!</p><p> This diminishing sensitivity to the pain of paying means that the first dollar we pay will cause the highest pain, the second dollar will cause us less, and so on, until we feel just a tiny twinge for, say, the forty-seventh dollar.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take this wisdom back to our financial planning service.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re an &lsquo;hourly-rate financial planner&rsquo; or a &lsquo;monthly-fee financial planner&rsquo;, what do you think happens when people have to pay you  <strong>  several times? </strong></p><p> Every time they have to pay you, you let people feel the pain of paying. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the price is low, they still feel a psychological pain.</p><p> It gets worse.</p><p> Because researchers from Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and MIT were able to show that activity in the insular can PREDICT whether people buy or not &hellip;</p><p> In the trial, participants first saw a product, then saw its price, and finally decided whether or not to purchase it.</p><p> As soon as participants saw the price, the insular got active&hellip; And activation was much greater for the products that people eventually didn&rsquo;t buy than for the products they did buy.</p><p> So when people don&rsquo;t buy, it&rsquo;s not just because they&rsquo;re evaluating your service and thinking about what else they could do with the money, it&rsquo;s also because they experience the IMMEDIATE psychological pain of spending!</p><h3> How to Make Buying your Financial Planning Service Hurt Less <br/>  </h3><p> First things first: why does buying your financial planning service hurt?</p><p> Well, the pain of spending stems from the fact that your financial planning service is an intangible service.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a product, which is tangible. It&rsquo;s not insurance, which is tangible.</p><p> Financial planning, by contrast, is intangible. In fact, financial planning does not even exist when people buy it from you. So, your prospect buys a service with no guarantees &ndash; and because of that  <strong>  he buys uncertainty.  </strong></p><p> Such as:</p><p> <strong>  The uncertainty </strong>  that your service doesn&rsquo;t live up to your prospect&rsquo;s expectations.</p><p> <strong>  The uncertainty </strong>  it may be a big waste of time.</p><p> And even worse,  <strong>  the uncertainty </strong>  that they just made a wrong decision that cost them a lot of money.</p><p> So, what do you need to do?</p><p> You have to  <strong>  remove the uncertainty </strong> . Because when you remove the uncertainty, you increase the number of people who want to buy your service.</p><p> How do you do that?</p><p> Well, here&rsquo;s the secret right off the bat:</p><p> You let people &lsquo;own&rsquo; your financial planning service</p><h3> Why Ownership Works (Backed by Science) <br/>  </h3><p> Why does the seller of a house usually value that property more than the potential buyer? Why does the seller of an automobile envision a higher price than the buyer?</p><p> In many transactions why does the owner believe that his possession is worth more money than the potential owner is willing to pay?</p><p> There&rsquo;s an old saying that goes like this: &ldquo;One man&rsquo;s ceiling is another man&rsquo;s floor&rdquo;.</p><p> Well, when you&rsquo;re the owner, you&rsquo;re at the ceiling; and when you&rsquo;re the buyer, you&rsquo;re at the floor. In other words: the ownership of something increases its value in the owner&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p> Ownership pervades our lives and, in a strange way, shapes many of the things we do. And since so much of our lives are dedicated to ownership, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to make the best decisions about this? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice, for instance, to know exactly how much we would enjoy the service of a financial planner?</p><p> Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. People are mostly fumbling around in the dark.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions-ebook/dp/B002RI9QJE/ref=sr_1_1_ha?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453157006&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=predictably+irrational\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Here&rsquo;s Dan Ariely again  </a> </u> :</p><li> <strong>  People fall in love with what they already have. </strong>  Ever sold a house? Then you probably remember the moment when you put the &ldquo;For-Sale-Sign&rdquo; in the window. You probably also remember the fine and special moments in that house. A warm glow of memory washes over you and the house. Now, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very likely that people get a warm glow about their financial advisor, but still it&rsquo;s hard to say goodbye to him, because most of the time it feels fine to stay put;</li><li> <strong>  People focus on what they can lose, rather than on what they may gain. </strong>  When we put a price on our beloved house, we think more about what we lose (the fine memories in the house) than what we will gain (future fine moments in the new house). Likewise your client focuses on the good moments his current advisor helped him with some difficult money-issues.</li><li> <strong>  People assume others will see the transaction from the same perspective as they do. </strong>  We somehow expect the buyer of the house to share our feelings, emotions and memories. Or we expect the buyer of our house to appreciate how the sunlight filters through the kitchen windows. Unfortunately, the buyer of the house is more likely to notice the strip of black mold in the corner. Just like many new financial advisors notice the &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; in the previous financial advice, rather than the good parts. <br/>  </li><p> Still, the question remains: how can you let your prospects &lsquo;own&rsquo; your service while not letting them feel the &lsquo;pain of paying&rsquo;?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the answer:  <strong>  You give them a rock solid guarantee. </strong></p><p> And I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: I can&rsquo;t give any guarantees about the outcomes of my financial plan!</p><p> I understand.</p><p> But that&rsquo;s not what I mean. I mean a type of guarantee that transfers the uncertainty from the prospect to YOU, the financial planner.</p><p> Like when you don&rsquo;t deliver the value as they would expect, they won&rsquo;t be out of pocket.</p><p> Just think about Zappos, FedEx and &ndash; for the Dutch readers &ndash; Coolblue. These famous companies use the perfect guarantee for their customers. And they&rsquo;ve built billion dollar businesses&hellip;</p><p> Here are 4 Types of Guarantees You Can Use</p><p> Derek Halpern (founder of socialtriggers.com)  <u>  <a href=\"http://socialtriggers.com/guarantees/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   once wrote a post  </a> </u>  about guarantees. And it got me thinking how to use guarantees in our financial planning service.</p><p> And what&rsquo;s the irrational thing you should know about guarantees?</p><p> You might think that guarantees with the least conditions are always the best. But that certainly isn&rsquo;t true.</p><p> Research shows that if customers are uncertain about the outcome of using your service until they experience it, conditions actually make your offer more credible.</p><p> So, let me walk you through some types of guarantees you can use with your financial planning service.</p><p> <strong>  Guarantee #1: The Standard Money Back Guarantee </strong></p><p> Offering a money back guarantee doesn&rsquo;t seem possible for our financial planning service, right?</p><p> Wrong.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute how to do that, but first remember this:</p><p> A simple money back guarantee won&rsquo;t make your service stand out from your competition, unless you&rsquo;re the only one who is offering it!</p><p> Because I&rsquo;m so sure this works, I&rsquo;ve implemented this in my own financial planning service. Here&rsquo;s how I do it:</p><p> So, what happens here?</p><p> First of all, what I&rsquo;m doing here is adding a little context.</p><p> You see, the most expensive option (the offer I  <strong>  don&rsquo;t </strong>  want people to choose) is seen as a price-anchor, making the other two options appear cheaper &ndash; and the cheapest option is a real no-brainer. The effect is that people rationalize purchasing the less expensive option by avoiding the most expensive option.  <u>  You can read psychological evidence here </u> .</p><p> But it&rsquo;s not the only weapon in my psychological armory.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve also added a money back guarantee to my &euro; 195 option. People get a &euro; 195 consultation with me. And if they aren&rsquo;t satisfied, then they can easily use the money back guarantee. No strings attached.</p><p> Pretty powerful.</p><p> <strong>  Guarantee #2: The Extensive Money Back Guarantee </strong></p><p> If you want to go crazy, you can do what Zappos does. They offer a 365 day return policy.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a huge benefit for you when using this strategy. Just think about what I told you about ownership a couple of sentences ago and you&rsquo;ll know.</p><p> And by the way, you become really, really remarkable when using this strategy.  <u>  And if you want to know why being remarkable is rewarding .., just click here </u> .</p><p> (One side note: if you offer this type of money back guarantee, please put that money aside &hellip;)</p><p> <strong>  Guarantee #3: More than Money Back Guarantee </strong></p><p> Put yourself in your customer&rsquo;s shoes for a moment. When they decide to hire you, they&rsquo;re not only risking the money they spent. They&rsquo;re also investing time and passing up other opportunities.</p><p> So, in reality, if they don&rsquo;t like your service, they still suffer a loss, even if they get their money back.</p><p> As a clever financial planner, you can adjust the payoff of your guarantee and offer MORE than money-back to solve that problem&hellip;</p><p> You can say something like this: &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t satisfied, you get your money back AND we&rsquo;ll guide you to other financial planners who can better serve you&rdquo;.</p><p> Huh?</p><p> Promoting other financial planners?</p><p> Yep. You&rsquo;re right. Again, try to stand in your customer&rsquo;s shoes. When you are offering a guarantee like this, you&rsquo;re actually saying: &ldquo;We really care about YOU (and not about our Assets under Management).</p><p> <u>  And by the why, science proves that vulnerability leads to powerful relationships with your prospects </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Guarantee #4: The Minimum Result Guarantee </strong></p><p> Instead of a vague satisfaction guarantee, it&rsquo;s always better to be clear and specific about the results customers can expect. And that&rsquo;s what a minimum result guarantee does.</p><p> Now, I know that offering this type of guarantees can be scary. I mean, what result are you really delivering after say one year? You can&rsquo;t say something like: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll reach our life-time financial goal in one year&rdquo;.</p><p> So, what are the alternatives?</p><p> Think smaller. Look at the results you achieved with your previous clients. And ask yourself: what&rsquo;s the minimum result I can guarantee?

If you&rsquo;re not aware of it, the gist of the case is that over the Easter 2015 weekend, a gang of thieves broke through a thick wall into the safe boxes of London&rsquo;s most elite jewellers and stole up to &pound;25 million worth of gold, silver and other collectibles and cash (originally the newspapers said up to &pound;200 million, but this was rationalised in court).  They achieved this by climbing down a lift shaft before drilling through a concrete wall before escaping with the jewels.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a classic old robbery which gained notoriety as not only one of the largest and most audacious raids in British history, but also the fact that the gang were inside the building whilst police ignored an alarm that could have caught the guys  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/22/police-release-pictures-of-hatton-garden-jewellery-raid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in the act  </a> </u> .</p><p> Nevertheless, after such embarrassment, the police did a good job and arrested nine men  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/hatton-garden-heist-arrests-seven-men-held-in-raids-in-north-london-10260986.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a month later  </a> </u> .  Again, it&rsquo;s been an intriguing case, as of the nine arrested, three are old age pensioners (OAPs) and the gang have a combined age of being 442 years old, or an average age of 63.  Did I say it&rsquo;s a classic OLD robbery?</p><p> Their crimes were played out in court just before Christmas and most were found guilty this week:</p><li> Ringleaders Brian Reader, 76, Terry Perkins, 67, Daniel Jones, 58 and Kenny Collins, 75, admitted conspiring to commit burglary from the start;</li><li> Carl Wood, 58, and William Lincoln, 60, were found guilty of the same charge by a jury following a trial;</li><li> Hugh Doyle, 48, was found guilty of conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property; whilst</li><li> Jon Harbinson, 42, was cleared of all charges. <br/>  </li><p> The robbery was planned over three years, starting in 2012 when gang leaders brought the book Forensics for Dummies (no, I&rsquo;m not making this up).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-20-at-11.06.54-AM-2.png\" width=\"622\"/></p><p> By May 2014, the planning had become far more specific, with the gang spending hours researching tools like the Hilti DD350 drill used to hollow out three large holes in the thick, concrete of the safety wall.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-20-at-11.06.59-AM-2.png\" width=\"629\"/></p><p> In January 2015, they started watching 88-90 Hatton Gardens, the target for the raid that occurred in April over three days during Easter.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/647085659093204994/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-647085659093204994;1043138249'\"/><p> So how come they got caught so quickly in May?  After all, during the trial, prosecuting counsel Philip Evans pointed at the ringleaders saying: &ldquo;these four&hellip; brought with them a great deal of experience in planning and executing sophisticated and serious acquisitive crime.&rdquo;  These weren&rsquo;t some young punk upstarts, but seasoned criminals who knew what they were doing.  But maybe that&rsquo;s why they were caught.  After all, some of this reads like a comedy script.</p><p> The main players were caught out as they boasted of their exploits during a drinking session at the Castle pub in Islington.  Undercover officers filmed Terry Perkins as he enthusiastically demonstrated to Brian Reader how they smashed their way into the vault, as Kenny Collins looked on.  The footage was recorded less than a month after the heist.</p><p> During the raid itself, it turns out, John Collins fell asleep while acting as a lookout, and later seemed partially deaf in court. Terrence Perkins was recorded by police complaining about his medicine regime and boasting that the haul &ldquo;could be his pension&rdquo;. Bill Lincoln was left out of the raid due to bladder problems and wet himself while in police custody. The oldest gang member was Brian Reader, dubbed &ldquo;the Master&rdquo; or &ldquo;the guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; by his colleagues. On the first day of the raid he rode to Hatton Garden using a borrowed over-60s travel card.</p><p> More than this, the old style gang were up against new style digital detectives.  For example, how did the police know the gang met at the Castle pub?  Easy.  The planning proper began at Islington&rsquo;s Castle pub in mid-January and, using mobile phone and vehicle-tracking data, police were able to establish that ringleaders Jones, Collins and Perkins were meeting there, usually on busy Friday nights.  Jones would usually call Wood the next day to keep him updated on their plans.</p><p> The police were further assisted by the fact the jewel safe had more sophisticated alarm systems and CCTV, as well as being able to use other supporting forensic developments, such as DNA analysis and facial recognition software.  One of the reasons the Hatton Garden burglars were caught is because they missed a single CCTV camera in the alley behind the building.  Then there are physical alarm devices: motion sensors, window monitors which detect glass shattering, or devices which trigger when a door is opened.</p><p> Other things have changed too.  For example, one of the largest robberies before this one was the Brinks Mat bullion robbery in 1983 when &pound;82 million was stolen.  A famous story about the Brinks Mat case is that &pound;500,000 in cash was taken into a bank in the City of London, worth around &pound;1.5 million today.  The cash was placed on the bank branch counter and the teller given instructions to send it to a bank account in Lichtenstein. Back then, the bank would only have said, &lsquo;do you want a receipt with that?&rsquo; Today, this would be nigh impossible thanks to money laundering regulations as the bank and its management would be criminally liable for any fraudulent transaction.</p><p> This is why physical crime such as this case, is a dying art in the digital age.  It&rsquo;s no longer robbing bank branches &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s where the money is&rdquo; but robbing bank websites &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s where the money is&rdquo;.  For example, the rate of bank robberies  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.bba.org.uk/news/press-releases/the-decline-of-the-british-bank-robber/#.VpQHwfntlBc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   as tracked by the British Bankers&rsquo; Association  </a> </u>  dropped from 847 in 1992 to just 66 in 2011. Something similar has happened in the USA, where bank robberies  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/14/todays-bonnie-and-clydes-getting-tougher-to-find.html\" target=\"_blank\">   fell 60%  </a> </u>  between 2004 and 2014.</p><p> On the other hand, crime in the internet age should be getting easier.  Google Maps lets you surf and find hundreds of potential targets while online directory services, such as TraceSmart, use the electoral register to match names to addresses. There&rsquo;s also the big change from social media as people post information on Facebook and LinkedIn which can easily be used to put pressure on them. If an employee is living a lifestyle which makes them vulnerable to blackmail, that&rsquo;s great for a criminal.</p><p> Similarly, clever malware and viruses are reaping rewards.  Mikko Hyponnen, chief research officer of Helsinki-based security firm F-Secure, reports that cybercriminals using  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.databreachtoday.com/malware-hides-except-when-shouts-a-8743\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CryptoWall ransomware  </a> </u>  version 3 have collectively cleared a cool $325 million. The figure could be higher because it represents only the ill-gotten CryptoWall gains that authorities have been able to trace (see  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/blogs/ransomware-are-we-in-denial-p-2031\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ransomware: Are We in Denial?  </a> </u> ).  There are certainly a few folks who are seeing Cybercrime Unicorns  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/blogs/i-believe-in-cybercrime-unicorns-p-2033\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   out there  </a> </u> , and this can only be set to rise.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"203\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-20-at-11.14.00-AM-2.png\" width=\"467\"/></p><p> So, in some ways it&rsquo;s sad to see the Granddad Gang being locked up for committing a good old analogue crime.  In other ways, it&rsquo;s sad to realize that the biggest physical heist in British history was $1 billion in bonds in 1990 followed by just $150 million in 1987.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"868\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-20-at-11.12.00-AM-2.png\" width=\"586\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-20-at-11.12.05-AM-2.png\" width=\"567\"/></p><p> Compared with the idea that we&rsquo;re now seeing multiple Cybercrime Unicorns reaping billions in stolen data, maybe the old analogue age wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all.</p><p> If you want to know more about the Hatton Cross crime, these articles are particularly good and provided the basis for much of the above coverage:</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/hatton-garden-heist-timeline-full-7180482\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hatton Garden heist timeline: The full details of how crooks pulled off the most daring robbery ever  </a> </u></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3399427/Three-men-guilty-Hatton-Garden-jewellery-raid-ringleaders-pleaded-guilty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bumbling villains aged 442 were snared by 21st century police surveillance after &pound;24million Hatton Garden heist  </a> </u></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/Hatton-Garden-is-it-still-possible-to-get-away-with-a-heist/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Is it still possible to get away with a heist?  </a> </u></p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-20 19:18:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-20 19:18:32.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_pj3QD0E.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/analogue-criminals-in-a-digital-world/\", \"post_id\": \"8717\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-20 19:18:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-20 19:18:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"analogue-criminals-in-a-digital-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8711\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4134\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Analogue-Criminals-in-a-Digital-World.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"945\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453388400,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3985,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Sales By 2020: What Will The World Look Like?","link":"sales-by-2020-what-will-the-world-look-like","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently, a lot has been said about what the outlook for sales by 2020 will look like. </p><p> Forrester kicked things off with their famous prediction that  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sales-jobs-vanishing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1 million sales jobs will vanish by 2020  </a> </u> . And then everyone, from Cranfield University to HBR jumped on the bandwagon. </p><p> Globally, there seems to be a consensus building around a few things. Yet, sales is a notoriously short-sighted profession. A world of weekly dashboards, quarterly targets and annual goals. </p><p> Most sales managers I speak with are firmly focused on 2016 &ndash; not 2020. At best, they&rsquo;ll be vaguely aware of what everyone is going on about, and be slightly amused by all these changes the &ldquo;analysts&rdquo; seem to be predicting.</p><p> Most sales managers are horribly wrong in ignoring the tidal wave of changes to come &ndash; for two main reasons.</p><p> First, thinking about sales by 2020 is not focused on some far-off point in time. We&rsquo;re talking 4 years here. 16 quarters. Most organisations move like oil tankers. Meaning that, if the world is going to change substantially by 2020, the time to get moving and start preparing is &hellip; now.</p><p> Second, the world that Forrester and others are predicting will come &hellip; is already here. The shift has already started. Sales by 2020 is in essence just a further development of sales in 2016. </p><p> We&rsquo;re not talking about how we&rsquo;ll all hoverboard to client meetings, or hold our annual sales retreats on Mars.</p><p> Much of what Forrester and everyone else is claiming will happen is already happening. Order takers on the way out ? Check. Consultants on the way up ? Check. Social selling becoming mainstream ? Check. </p><p> It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re all going to wake up one day and find the world magically transformed &ndash; the changes that everyone who&rsquo;s keeping a long-term perspective on sales are predicting are already here.</p><p> Specifically, there are 7 major shifts that have already started, and will gradually change the nature of sales by 2020. </p><h3> #1. Order Takers On The Out, Consultants On The Rise</h3><p> <br/> Maybe I have a biased perspective (most of my clients sell complex, high-end B2B services and already sell as consultants), but this train has definitely already left the station.</p><p> Many sales managers and business leaders I speak with have already caught on to the fact that the skillset (and mindset) for success in sales today is very different from what it was 10 years ago. They see it on their dashboards, and their sales figures. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Those%20who%20are%20successful%20in%20sales%20today%20act%20more%20like%20high-end%20management%20consultants&amp;via=Acluytens&amp;related=Acluytens&amp;url=http://agocluytens.com/sales-by-2020/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Those who are successful in sales today act more like high-end management consultants  </a> </u></p><p> They educate their clients with new ideas and perspectives. Co-create and collaborate on solution development. And win the sale not by deploying some clever closing technique, but by demonstrating that the overall value they deliver is superior to other options.</p><h3> #2. &ldquo;Prospecting&rdquo; Will Move From Outbound To Inbound</h3><p> <br/> For as long as we can remember, prospecting has been about generating outbound sales leads &ndash; but recently that&rsquo;s started to shift around completely. </p><p> In the future, a key skillset for successful sellers will not be their ability to prospect &ndash; it will be their ability to generate inbound leads (for themselves), and qualify those leads. Sellers will become their own mini-marketing department.</p><p> Buyer behavior is changing. With every single study, the effectiveness of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo;, outbound prospecting techniques is dropping. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/04/b2b-salespeople-can-survive-if-they-reimagine-their-roles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Savvy sellers are already transforming themselves  </a> </u>  as experts in their space. They already understand the value of being prominently placed on search engines. And they have caught on to the fact that if buyers want to go online to consider their options, they need to be highly visible as one of those options.</p><p> In the future, &ldquo;prospecting&rdquo; will revolve around brand positioning, SEO/SEM, online relevance and supporting the buyer journey. The very idea that once we used to pick up the phone to call complete strangers and try to generate &ldquo;meetings&rdquo; will be seen as ridiculous and antiquated.</p><h3> #3. Inside Sales, Outside Sales. Tomato, Tomato.</h3><p> <br/> OK. So there are a bunch of people now predicting that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.insidesalesbox.com/blog/5-reasons-why-inside-sales-will-replace-outside-sales-by-2020\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   inbound sales is growing faster than outbound sales  </a> </u> , and will ultimately come to replace it. </p><p> In the future, there will be no distinction between inbound and outbound sales. Everyone will ultimately come to rely, for the most part, on what we now call outbound sales (except, by then, we&rsquo;ll just call it &ldquo;sales&rdquo;).</p><p> I can&rsquo;t think of a single seller who hasn&rsquo;t already embraced the fact that technology makes it easier, more cost-effective and more efficient to sell. Not a one.</p><p> In the future, we&rsquo;ll all use online meeting solutions, chat, social media and a host of other technology as the core part of how we do our jobs. In fact, for many sales pros, that&rsquo;s already the case (I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I went out to see a client for a &ldquo;sales meeting&rdquo;).</p><h3> #4. Social Selling Will Henceforth Be Known As &ldquo;Just Selling&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> When I started my career in management consulting, there were two hot topics on the horizon: mobile and e-business. Today, those things are just as natural and normal to us as breathing. </p><p> For 95% of the population, there is zero need for training or education around &ldquo;how to buy online&rdquo; or &ldquo;how to use your smartphone&rdquo;.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=In%20the%20future%2C%20ALL%20sellers%20will%20use%20social%20media%20to%20position%20themselves%20as%20experts%20in%20their%20space&amp;via=Acluytens&amp;related=Acluytens&amp;url=http://agocluytens.com/sales-by-2020/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   In the future, ALL sellers will use social media to position themselves as experts in their space  </a> </u></p><p> It&rsquo;s not going to require any special training, or cause great debate around whether or not it&rsquo;ll &ldquo;revolutionize selling&rdquo;.</p><p> It&rsquo;ll just happen.</p><p> Except, we&rsquo;ll  <a href=\"http://barbaragiamanco.com/why-im-over-social-selling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   just call it &ldquo;selling&rdquo;  </u>  . </a>  Plain and simple. </p><h3> #5. Salespeople Will Become Businesspeople. And Specialists.</h3><p> <br/> In 2016, you can still get away with having a fairly high-level understanding of your client&rsquo;s industry, business model and organizational issues. When we&rsquo;re in sales by 2020, that will no longer happen.</p><p> As buyers demand increased levels of professionalism, insights, knowledge and in-depth understanding of their challenges, industries and operations,  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/SalesCubes/sales-2020-the-future-of-sales-and-sales-management/58-Find_our_book_on_Amazon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   sellers will be forced to specialize  </u>  . </a></p><p> Yet, at the same time, buyers will expect sellers to have a broad-based business background, and be conversational on things like corporate strategy, finance, operations and management. </p><p> The most successful sellers will be businesspeople first, sellers second.</p><h3> #6. The Tension Between Sellers And Clients Will Disappear.</h3><p> <br/> For decades (and perhaps longer), the interests and objectives of sellers and clients were virtually diametrically opposed.

{"original_id":3986,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Email Rules: 8 Tips So You Don't Drive Your Readers to Distraction!","link":"email-rules-8-tips-so-you-dont-drive-your-readers-to-distraction","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It drives me crazy when I email information to people &ndash; information that they requested &ndash; and they don&rsquo;t acknowledge that they received the email, let alone thank me! <br/> <br/> Have you ever felt a similar sentiment? Many have. <br/> <br/> I believe strongly that people in the workplace should let you know they have received information you have sent them, and, if they requested that information, good manners requires that they thank you.  <br/> <br/> One of my students followed my advice and sent an email to her professor, thanking him for his email answering several of her questions about an upcoming project. The professor was so pleased that the student had thanked him that he gave her two additional points on her project.  No student had ever thanked him before.  <br/>   <br/> It is rude when people don&rsquo;t acknowledge your time or effort to help them. Replying with a simple &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; is all that is needed. You can, of course, write more, such as: &ldquo;Thank you for the information. It will be helpful.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Here are 7 additional suggestions so you don&rsquo;t drive others crazy with your emails:  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Remember that you are writing an email, not a text. </strong>  Do not use text shortcuts. All too often, people forget and write &ldquo;u&rdquo; for &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;GR8&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;great,&rdquo; and so on. Email is informal communication, but not that informal.  Also avoid text acronyms, such as BAU for  &ldquo;business as usual,&rdquo;  as in,  I had a slow morning , but this afternoon it was BAU. It is also rare for emoticons or emoji to be appropriate for business email. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Use a descriptive subject line. </strong>  Make the subject line informative and inviting. Often, people will not open an email unless the subject line indicates it&rsquo;s something worth reading. Target the reader. Good lines may be something like &ldquo;Question about your service,&rdquo; &ldquo;Suggestion for the meeting,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good news about the project.&rdquo; Think about what subject lines have caught your attention. You can often model yours after them.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Pay attention. </strong>  You need to concentrate. If you don&rsquo;t, you can easily send an email before you have finished editing your comments, or send the email to the wrong people. One senior manager wrote to me:  &ldquo;Feel free to use me as an example of why you never want to multi-task when it comes to emails.&rdquo;  She was interviewing a candidate for a leadership position and emailed a question to HR &ndash; or so she thought. It went to me instead!  <br/> <br/> Some email errors can have more serious implications. Consider what happened at the New York Times a few years ago, as the Associated Press reported:  <br/> <br/> The New York Times thought it was sending an email to a few hundred people who had recently canceled subscriptions, offering them a 50 percent discount for 16 weeks to lure them back. Instead, Wednesday's offer went to 8.6 million email addresses of people who had given them to the Times. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Include a signature block </strong> , providing your reader with some information about you. Generally, this would state your full name, title, the company name, and your contact information, including a phone number. People have said to me:  Why is he making me search for his number? I hate that!   You also can add a little publicity for yourself, but don&rsquo;t go overboard with any sayings or artwork. Use the same font, type size, and color as the rest of the email. One engineer wanted her name to stand out, so she used 24 point, bright blue type. The rest of the email was 12 point black type. Her name stood out, but not in a good way.   <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Don&rsquo;t overuse &ldquo;reply all.&rdquo; </strong>  Too often, this only contributes to email overload. People don&rsquo;t want to receive emails that they don&rsquo;t need to see.  It wastes their time. Use &ldquo;reply all&rdquo; only when it is necessary for everyone on the list to see the email.   <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Don&rsquo;t send an email when you are angry. </strong>  In angry mode, you are likely to write unkind or nasty comments. Before you hit the send button, consider what the consequences of your words might be. Put the email aside until you calm down. Then re-read what you have written, and decide whether you really want to send those comments.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  7. Tell the sender if you received an email in error.  </strong> Unless you do, the person who sent the email will believe it was delivered to the correct person. A simple reply to the writer is all that is needed, such as:  I don&rsquo;t think you intended to send this to me. Just wanted to let you know.   </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-20 19:27:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-20 19:27:01.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_eM1byF3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/email-rules-8-tips-so-you-dont-drive-your-readers-to-distraction/\", \"post_id\": \"8720\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-20 19:27:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-20 19:27:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"email-rules-8-tips-so-you-dont-drive-your-readers-to-distraction\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8719\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4136\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Drive-Your-Readers-to-Distraction-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"606\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453395600,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3987,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Maximize Your Employees' Potential With Personalized Performance Development Plans","link":"maximize-your-employees-potential-with-personalized-performance-development-plans","source_link":null,"content":"<p> So you&rsquo;ve just finished with performance and 360 degree reviews and you notice one of your employees is struggling. Though some employees may take constructive feedback as a great opportunity to implement new insights into their work style, others may instead become discouraged. After  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.feedback.tips/give-constructive-feedback-to-employees-team-members/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   giving constructive feedback  </a> </u>  what more should you be doing to help them get back on track? </p><p> As a manager your key responsibility is to help your employees grow and develop professionally. The cost of hiring, onboarding and training a new employee far outweighs the cost of simply taking time to coach and develop your existing team members. Not to mention the impact firing one employee can have on the team as a whole.</p><p> Great coaching always begins with a strong performance development plan. When you&rsquo;re working with an employee who&rsquo;s really struggling the most difficult question becomes where to start? It&rsquo;s important not to overload them with too many improvements at once. This can lead to confusion or work to further discourage them. The best strategy is to pick a few areas to focus on first. So should you begin with the area where they&rsquo;re struggling the most or the skills that are most relevant to their job description? The answer may surprise you.</p><p> It may sound counterintuitive, but what you should actually focus on are the areas where they show the most potential. Strengths based development is an HR movement that has been growing in popularity. According to a  <u>  2015 survey </u>  by Researcher and Applied Psychology expert Michelle McQuaid, 64% of employees believe they are more successful when building up their strengths as opposed to weaknesses. This can have a major impact on motivation as employees who have strengths discussions with their managers are 78% more likely to feel their work is appreciated and making a difference within the team.</p><p> Similarly, the survey found that managers who know their employees&rsquo; strengths are 71% more likely to have employees who are engaged and energized. When managers know their employees&rsquo; strengths they are in a better position to assign tasks that will motivate and incentivize them. This can have a major impact on employee turnover. According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/186311/making-career-moves-americans-switch-companies.aspx?g_source=STRENGTHS_BASED_DEVELOPMENT&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Gallup Survey  </a> </u> , 93% of US adults who left their employer left to pursue a career change. If managers instead create more opportunities for career mobility within an organization they will be more likely to retain and grow a more talented workforce.</p><h3> Follow these steps to help your employees personalize their own strengths based development plan: <br/>  </h3><h3> Self Assessment <br/>  </h3><p> Everyone has their own skills, they just need to learn how to identify and develop them. After giving them the results of their 360 or performance review, first ask your employee to come up with a list of their interests. This should also include hobbies outside of the workplace. It&rsquo;s important that they have time to think this over and aren&rsquo;t influenced by others. While some HR experts may advise you to be involved in this step, as their manager, employees may be inclined to agree and take your advice simply to keep you happy.</p><p> They should then come up with a list of their skills. If they&rsquo;re having trouble deciding where to begin, Impraise&rsquo;s self assessment feature can be a useful tool to organize thoughts and get ideas for teamwork, leadership and company specific skills. However, their self assessment shouldn&rsquo;t only focus on traditional workplace skills. Skills or habits that are perceived to be weaknesses can also be honed into strengths if directed in the right way. For example, daydreaming can lead employees to get distracted from their work easily but daydreamers also tend to have strong analytical skills which can be geared towards coming up with out of the box solutions.</p><p> The results of their review can also be a great resource to get better insights into what others perceive as their strengths in the workplace. At the same time, be sure to advise them not to let the perception of others influence them too much. If they&rsquo;re good at inputting data but hate doing it, this is probably not a career path they want to pursue. Comparing the list of their interests and strengths will help them to come up with the workplace skills they are most interested in developing.</p><h3> Set up a one-on-one <br/>  </h3><p> At this meeting you&rsquo;ll go over the list together. Your job is to connect their skills and interests to your company&rsquo;s objectives. If they have a knack for languages, they may be a great fit for a team tackling a new foreign market.</p><p> If they don&rsquo;t already have some short and long term goals in mind help them to come up with some in the context of your company and team&rsquo;s objectives. These goals should be challenging yet attainable, providing the right amount of motivation without the risk of getting lost along the way.</p><p> With your employee&rsquo;s strengths, interests and goals in mind, offer suggestions for ways they can train, develop and improve their skills. This can include offering stretch assignments, giving them information about extra trainings they could attend or helping them to seek out mentors who can provide them with further guidance.</p><p> Help them come up with time frames and measurements for achieving these goals. Remember being too ambitious could lead to disillusionment, while leaving things too open may lead them to get side tracked. Maybe you set them a goal to write up two reports on consumer trends in new markets or to increase inbound leads by x%. As long as they are assignments that play to your employee&rsquo;s strengths and are within reach you will see a significant change in motivation and engagement levels.</p><p> A useful method to make sure these goals will incentivize rather than discourage your employee is the  <u>  <a href=\"http://hrweb.mit.edu/performance-development/goal-setting-developmental-planning/smart-goals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SMART model  </a> </u> . This includes making sure their goals are specific, measureable, attainable, relevant and time bound. Use this model as a check list.</p><p> By helping them to link their strengths and interests to attainable goals, employees will be able to take ownership of their own professional development plan.</p><h3> Encourage through Feedback</h3><p> <br/> After this meeting you want to keep encouraging your employee to continue on the development plan but also be careful not to put them under pressure to achieve results immediately. The best way to encourage them is through  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.impraise.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   continuous feedback  </a> </u> . When you see they&rsquo;ve reached a milestone in their development, be sure to acknowledge their success. When you see them struggling, offer up some advice. It&rsquo;s important that they know you&rsquo;re taking a vested interest in their development but are encouraging, not demanding quick results.</p><h3> Review</h3><p> <br/> Schedule another one-on-one to review their progress. This could be in two weeks or a month, the important thing is that it gives them enough time to meet some of the measurement targets. Hopefully at this point they&rsquo;ve made some strides in the right direction. Now it&rsquo;s time to check in and make sure they keep up the progress. Start off by telling them about the progress they&rsquo;ve made. Knowing specifically what they&rsquo;ve been doing right will help them to continue on the same path. Then tell them what they still need to improve and give them advice on how they can accomplish this.</p><p> Once they&rsquo;ve developed their strengths, your employee will have the confidence and experience to begin developing other areas they may need more improvement on.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-20 19:31:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-20 19:31:06.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_PyPJDKa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/maximize-your-employees-potential-with-personalized-performance-development-plans/\", \"post_id\": \"8722\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-20 19:31:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-20 19:31:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"maximize-your-employees-potential-with-personalized-performance-development-plans\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8721\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4137\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Maximize-Your-Employees-Potential-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"404\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453402800,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3988,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"12 Es Impacting Employee Experience","link":"12-es-impacting-employee-experience","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  A lot of elements comprise the employee experience. Many, ironically, start with the letter E. </strong> <br/> <br/> Last year, I  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/03/whats-meaning-of-all-of-this-employee.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wrote about some of the employee lingo  </a> </u>  that gets bandied about, often interchangeably - and, sadly, incorrectly so. For whatever reason, as I started writing today's post, I was reminded of that post. Regardless, the lingo I'm writing about today is more specific to what makes up the employee experience.  <br/> <br/> Oddly enough, as I started thinking about what impacts the employee experience, the factors I came up with all started with the letter E. I know there are others, but I think these cover a lot of territory. <br/> <br/> Stick with me here. <br/> <br/> First and foremost, let me define  <strong>  employee experience. </strong> My definition is:</p>The sum of all interactions that an employee has with his employer during the duration of his employment relationship. It includes any way the employee \"touches\" the company and vice versa in the course of doing his job. And how he feels and what he thinks about those interactions.<br/> <p> Basically, the experience is impacted by all the Es I'll share; I'm sure there are a few other factors, as well. <br/> <br/> Without a doubt, the first E is the  <strong>  employee </strong> ! They're obviously an essential ingredient! <br/> <br/> The other critical E is the  <strong>  employer </strong> . And this one plays a huge role in the experience, obviously. The employer sets the tone for the relationship at the outset, as early as the candidate experience. Which leads me to talk about... <br/> <br/> <strong>  Expectations: </strong> The difference between expectations and performance leads to (dis)satisfaction. Expectations about the company, the brand, the role, and the employee experience are set as early as during the  <u>  <a href=\"http://cxjourney.blogspot.com/2012/09/how-recruiting-impacts-brand-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recruiting  </a> </u> , interviewing, and hiring processes. Communication is key; communicate them clearly. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Emotions/Emotional Intelligence: </strong> When you understand how your emotions affect others, when you have this emotional awareness, you can better control your reactions - to your co-workers and to your customers - and use the emotions in a positive way. It then keeps you from attacking others, allows you to feel empathy, and allows you to solve problems and resolve conflict more effectively and diplomatically. Your emotions will affect your own experience and that of the people working with or around you. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Effectiveness: </strong> What does the employee bring to the table? How good is he at delivering the desired outcome? Does he have the tools, resources, attitude, background, common sense, and motivation to do the job and to get the job done? If we don't feel effective, it's a bit of a downer. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Effort: </strong> There are two types of effort; one is  discretionary effort , which refers to going above and beyond what is expected, the other is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/10/reduce-employee-effort-for-great.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   overall effort  </a> </u> , in terms of how easy it is to get the job done. In this instance, I'm referring to the latter. Are there processes that hinder the employee's ability to do his job in an efficient manner? This definitely impacts the experience. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Engagement: </strong> Some might argue this doesn't belong here - and perhaps there's a chicken-and-egg thing going on here - but if the employee is engaged, the experience is going to be much better than if he's not.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/05/employee-engagement-is-not-mandate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Engagement  </a> </u>  comes from within, and yet the company has a role in it, as well. When there's some confluence of: (1) emotions, commitment, passion, sense of ownership, etc. on the part of the employee about the brand and (2) what the organization does (purpose, brand promise, who the company is and why, etc.) to facilitate and enhance those emotions or that commitment - then we have employee engagement. (And this is where discretionary effort comes in to play.) <br/> <br/> <strong>  Empowered/Enabled: </strong> When employees are empowered, they walk around with a sense of ownership, thinking and acting like they own the business. When you own a business, you put your heart and soul into it, into making it succeed.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/11/empower-employees-to-increase.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Empowered  </a> </u>  employees don't stand on the sidelines waiting to be spoon-fed; they know what to do. They take the horse by the reins and run with the directive (aka the brand promise), being accountable for their roles in the execution of the customer experience and in the success of the business. They work together with others who are just as passionate and who share a common goal. These things combined result in efficiencies from a variety of angles. And a better experience. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Efficiency: </strong>  If we reduce employee effort and increase employee empowerment, the outcome ought to be improved  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/12/work-harder-or-smarter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employee efficiency  </a> </u> . If we hire the right employees, if our employees are engaged and passionate about what they do, the outcome ought to be improved employee efficiency; they'll find the right way to work.</p><p> <br/> <strong>  Education: </strong> The better educated your employees are about the task at hand, the vision, the mission, the brand promise, your products, the desired customer experience, etc., the better they will work, the better their experience. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Environment: </strong>  This one might seem like a catch-all, but the overall environment has a huge impact on the employee experience. A positive environment, one that prioritizes and facilitates a great experience for employees, is conducive to employees giving their all. I include in environment: workspace, tools, resources,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/12/define-your-employee-centric-culture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   culture  </a> </u> , values,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/08/cx-journey-musings-guiding-principles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   guiding principles  </a> </u> , leadership, feedback, communication, and more.</p><p> <br/> <strong>  Energy: </strong> The energy, the passion, the emotional investment that employees have for the brand, the product, and their roles certainly impacts the experience they'll have as an employee of the company. It will impact the amount of discretionary effort put forth on a daily basis, too. <br/> <br/> What else would you add?  <br/> <br/> It all came down to employee engagement.

{"original_id":3989,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Ways To Boost Your Emotional Intelligence","link":"three-ways-to-boost-your-emotional-intelligence","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I think the single common characteristic found in senior leaders is they almost all have exceptionally high emotional intelligence. </p><p> Andrew Coleman in  A Dictionary of Psychology  defines emotional intelligence as the ability of individuals to recognize their own and other people's  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions\" target=\"_blank\">   emotions  </a> </u> , to discriminate between different feelings and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior.</p><p> Raising your emotional intelligence will help you be a better and more effective leader. </p><p> Although, some are born with an inherent sixth sense, if you will, it&rsquo;s also a talent that can be learned, nurtured and improved upon.  Here are 3 ways to boost your emotional intelligence.</p><h3> Journal To Aid Reflection.  <br/>  </h3><p> Take time off to reflect.  Sounds easy and it&rsquo;s a bit of a clich&eacute;.  Everyone takes time off to recharge his or her batteries, but rarely is this time used for reflection.  It&rsquo;s hard. </p><p> Journaling helps.  It makes us stop to think about specific events from the past and then translate these events into written words.  It&rsquo;s almost the very definition of personal reflection. </p><p> There are some added benefits as well. I learned to write better and I now have a historical document I can pass on to my daughter when she gets older.   </p><p> Additionally, when reflecting upon past events I find it most effective to explore the situation entirely from someone else&rsquo;s vantage point. </p><p> This way, we can glean key insights into our own behavior and how we are coming across to others.  This is powerful stuff for our own growth.  </p><p> Go out and get one of those huge industrial journals and get started.</p><h3> Look In The Mirror.  <br/>  </h3><p> When things go wrong, and invariably they will, where do you look first?  Great leaders look inward initially and ask themselves a key question, &ldquo;What could I have done better to prevent this from happening?&rdquo; </p><p> Ever notice most head coaches accept the blame for when their teams lose?  They always know there are a few decisions they could have improved upon.  Perhaps they could have prepared the team better or maybe they could have devised a different game plan. </p><p> Leaders of any organization should do the same thing.  A leader&rsquo;s job is to ensure planning takes place, approve the plan and establish conditions for successful execution. </p><p> Granted, sometimes things just go wrong without any explanation, but more often than not, if we as leaders are honest with ourselves, we know we could have always done better. </p><p> It&rsquo;s a tough burden to bear to be sure, but that&rsquo;s part of being a leader. </p><p> Here&rsquo;s something to think about on this topic.  Which leader would you follow?  The leader who blames everyone for everything and never accepts responsibility, or the leader that shoulders the blame when appropriate, passes on lessons learned in a constructive manner and moves on?  Be the latter, not the former.</p><h3> Read Biography.   <br/>  </h3><p> Ok. I&rsquo;ll admit it. I love biography.  However, beyond being fascinating stories, biographies show us there are things that almost every great person has had in common.</p><p> They all worked hard.  I haven&rsquo;t read a single biography where the subject lucked into their good fortune. Certainly some people get breaks along the way, but more often than not, their &ldquo;luck&rdquo; is really the result of being prepared for opportunity.</p><p> Additionally, every historical figure has had to deal with the people of their time.  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  This tells us we aren&rsquo;t alone in dealing with the people of our day. </p><p> Not everyone we meet will agree with us, no matter how good our ideas are, and not everyone will like us either.  We&rsquo;ll have to work with people we&rsquo;d rather not and we&rsquo;ll have to put up with their peccadillos, just like they put up with ours.</p><p> Finally, biography is history and history teaches us that most ideas, concepts and situations are not necessarily new.  We can use these lessons and apply them to our current situation. </p><p> Additionally, we gain a more informed and nuanced perspective.</p><h3> Conclusion. <br/>  </h3><p> Want to prepare yourself for the C-Suite?  Start learning the skills and honing the talents you&rsquo;ll need.  Reflect, practice some introspection and read biography.   Good luck.</p><p> Got some other ideas for boosting your emotional intelligence?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-20 19:47:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-20 19:47:28.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ueTicgP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-ways-to-boost-your-emotional-intelligence/\", \"post_id\": \"8726\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-20 19:47:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-20 19:47:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-ways-to-boost-your-emotional-intelligence\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8725\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4139\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Emotional-Intelligence.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"424\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453406400,"author_id":381,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s a great community. But I just can&rsquo;t trust that builder. If they hire someone LIKE HER as their sales manager, I question who&rsquo;s running the place. How can they allow her to act so cocky? How can we be sure their project managers or contractors will be any less self-centered? I&rsquo;m sorry, I know you like it, but can we just keep looking a little more?&rdquo;</p><p> We settled on a similar house a mile down the road. They probably thought it was the fireplace options. Nope. It was &ldquo;Sarah.&rdquo;</p><h3> 6 Competencies Your Sales Team Must Master</h3><p> <br/> Great selling never feels like it. That&rsquo;s why so many companies are moving away from traditional sales roles and teaching their teams to be &ldquo;consultants,&rdquo; &ldquo;strategic partners,&rdquo; and &ldquo;solutions architects.&rdquo; Of course a rose by any other name&hellip; Here are six key competencies fundamental to your sales team&rsquo;s success.</p><h3> 1. Knowing When To Walk Away</h3><p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXRq4L4BcbQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kenny Rodgers  </u>    </a> was right, at least on this note.  Your team will do more harm selling the wrong fit. Train your team to understand the value proposition behind: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure this is the best solution for you right now, may I recommend&hellip;(insert competitors name here).&rdquo; Trust me, I do this all the time in my own business. It&rsquo;s painful. But this approach builds loyalty and referrals. Never sell anyone anything that isn&rsquo;t just right.</p><p> Your customers must know that your team has best interests at heart. They have to be sure you care more about their mission and the greater good, than your numbers.</p><h3> 2. Asking Great Questions</h3><p> Your team can&rsquo;t make great recommendations if they don&rsquo;t get the scene. Train them to ask strategic, open-ended questions and truly listen to the response.</p><h3> 3. Showing Up With Confident Humility</h3><p> Your customers want to know you have a great solution to their problem. Start with a great product that your team can be proud of. Then work hard to get your team past their own agendas, listening well to offer real solutions that meet the need. If it&rsquo;s ever more about the sales guy than the customer, you&rsquo;re sunk. You can&rsquo;t fake confident humility.</p><h3> 4. Building Genuine Connection</h3><p> People don&rsquo;t do business with businesses, they do business with human beings. Encourage your team to slow down and learn about the people they&rsquo;re working with. Then stay connected by remaining interested. &ldquo;How did your daughter do in that game?&rdquo; &ldquo;How was your trip?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is your wife feeling any better?&rdquo;</p><h3> 5. Staying Patient</h3><p> Yes, I know that most B2B sales take at least seven touch-points before the decision maker takes action. Of course your best sales people stay hungry. But no one wants to be rushed into a decision. Customers appreciate being given the space to make the right decision.</p><h3> 6. Giving Generously</h3><p> Almost every day I get asked, &ldquo;If you keep giving away all this free content why would any one ever hire you?&rdquo; Sure there are companies that will take your free ______ (trial, consulting, white paper) and run. But those aren&rsquo;t the clients you want to work with in the long run. Teach your sales team to give generously and add value above all else. It might take some time, but your company will be top of mind when they&rsquo;re (and others they know) are ready.</p><p> In an era where almost anything can be bought with one click, if your customer wants to talk to a human, be sure they&rsquo;re a good one.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-20 19:53:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-20 19:53:43.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_pl4sd50.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-competencies-your-sales-team-must-master/\", \"post_id\": \"8728\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-20 19:53:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-20 19:53:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-competencies-your-sales-team-must-master\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8727\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4140\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-Competencies-Your-Sales-Team-Must-Master-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"703\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453373100,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3991,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Writing for Investors? Avoid Industry Jargon","link":"writing-for-investors-avoid-industry-jargon","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Like most highly specialized industries, the investment industry has a unique set of words and phrases that mean little to people outside of the industry.</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s essentially the definition of industry jargon, and it isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing. When you&rsquo;re writing or speaking to other professionals within your industry, those industry-specific words and phrases can sometimes be the fastest and most effective to communicate.</p><p> On the other hand, when you&rsquo;re communicating with anyone who doesn&rsquo;t work in the investment industry, including investors, industry jargon can be confusing at best and completely meaningless at worst. Here, we&rsquo;ve chosen five terms to avoid when writing for investors.</p><h3> 1. Headwinds/tailwinds</h3><p> <br/> To people outside of the investment industry, headwinds and tailwinds are something they experience when they&rsquo;re on an airplane. When they fly west, they have to deal with headwinds, so their flight takes longer. When they fly east, they benefit from tailwinds, so their flight is a bit quicker.</p><p> Hmm&hellip; that must mean that headwinds are bad and tailwinds are good, right? Usually, but your reader had to make a lot of connections before they could figure out what you were trying to say. Why not say &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; or &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; if that&rsquo;s what you mean? Better yet, be specific and explain exactly what challenges or benefits you&rsquo;re talking about.</p><h3> 2. Secular</h3><p> <br/> This is another term that takes on an entirely different meaning outside of the investment industry. It generally means the opposite of spiritual or religious. If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re writing about, &ldquo;secular&rdquo; is absolutely the right word to use. If not, the word you&rsquo;re probably looking for is &ldquo;long term.&rdquo; To avoid any confusion, keep it simple.</p><h3> 3. Upside potential/downside risk</h3><p> <br/> For investors who don&rsquo;t have in-depth knowledge of the investment industry, these terms lack any meaning. We understand that it&rsquo;s much simpler to write &ldquo;upside potential&rdquo; than it is to explain that you expect a certain stock price to increase over the short term and tell your readers why. But if your audience doesn&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re writing about, why write it at all. We would say the exact same thing about the term &ldquo;downside risk.&rdquo;</p><p> We understand that it&rsquo;s much simpler to write &ldquo;upside potential&rdquo; than it is to explain that you expect a certain stock price to increase over the short term and tell your readers why. But if your audience doesn&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re writing about, why write it at all.</p><h3> 4. Alpha and beta</h3><p> <br/> When an investor reads about a fund&rsquo;s performance, they care how that fund performed relative to a benchmark index. If a fund had higher returns than the index, just say so. There&rsquo;s no reason to throw the word &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; in there.</p><p> The word &ldquo;beta&rdquo; is a bit different, because it has a very specific meaning when you&rsquo;re talking capital asset pricing models, and there&rsquo;s no other word that quite works. If you have to use &ldquo;beta&rdquo; in that context, consider defining it for investors. However, we find that &ldquo;beta&rdquo; is often used to mean risk or volatility in general. If that&rsquo;s what you mean, either of those words would be a much better choice.</p><h3> 5. Underlying fundamentals</h3><p> <br/> This one makes our list because it can mean so many things that it becomes almost meaningless. If you&rsquo;re writing about a certain company, are you focusing on its revenues, earnings, assets, liabilities or all of the above? The defining &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; of a given sector could range from pricing structure to regulatory issues to supply versus demand.</p><p> The term gets even fuzzier when you&rsquo;re talking about the underlying fundamentals of a broad market. Avoid this term completely and explain exactly what factors you&rsquo;re concerned about or encouraged by.</p><p> This list is far from complete, but it&rsquo;s a good place to start if you&rsquo;re looking to make your writing more investor-friendly. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 18:49:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 18:49:40.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_3MkOAp9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/writing-for-investors-avoid-industry-jargon/\", \"post_id\": \"8729\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 18:49:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 18:49:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"writing-for-investors-avoid-industry-jargon\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8727\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4141\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-Competencies-Your-Sales-Team-Must-Master-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"611\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453455900,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}

Imagine it: machinery was replacing &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; jobs at breakneck speed, and in a span of just 40 years people saw the invention of the telephone, the lightbulb, the airplane, and the Model T Ford. The changes were a shock to nearly everyone&rsquo;s way of life.</p><p> I&rsquo;d love to see Chaplin&rsquo;s take on the rapid change we&rsquo;ve seen over the past 40 years. Computers and other advancements have altered how we earn our dollars, how we spend our dollars, and how we shape our own futures. And just as it was in the early part of the last century, there are pros and cons to every change.</p><li> <strong>  Communication:  </strong> Can you imagine life without a cell phone? 87% of adults in the US now use mobile phones, and it&rsquo;s hard to remember a time when getting lost on the road meant searching for a pay phone for help! From cell phones to the Internet to Skype, it seems every time we turn around there&rsquo;s a new way to stay connected. Instant communication has changed our lives in many ways. Yet who would have expected to pay hundreds of dollars each month for what most people now consider necessarytechnology?</li><li> <strong>  Energy: </strong> The focus on alternative energy sources was fueled (pun intended!) by the need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and imports from the Middle East. As a result, natural gas is back on the map, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fracking  </a> </u>  is providing new sources of energy as well as jobs. To compete, oil companies have &ldquo;turned on the pump,&rdquo; making oil cheaper than it&rsquo;s been in years. And while consumers are smiling at the gas pump, the downside is less incentive to continue to invest in solar power, wind power, and other alternatives that reduce the impact on natural resources.</li><li> <strong>  Banking: </strong> Just 15 years ago, waiting in line at the bank to deposit your Friday paycheck was the norm. Then came the ATM. Then mobile banking. Now, apps allow you to take a photo of your checks for mobile deposits. We use  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Applepay  </a> </u>  to pay for goods and services, and  <u>  <a href=\"https://venmo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Venmo  </a> </u>  to pay our friends. In the brokerage world, roboadvisors are streamlining processes and helping to reduce costs. Automation is, it seems, everything.

Now that doctors are being compensated for keeping patients out of the hospital rather than filling hospital beds, they&rsquo;ve had to completely rethink their business models to focus on patient outcomes instead of patient volume.

On the plus side, all of this new intelligence is expected to give us more free time to do the things we love to do (less driving, more playing!). I&rsquo;m all for that! <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s an interesting time, to say the least. From a financial planning perspective, here are three things that can help see you through the changes that I&rsquo;m certain will continue for a long time to come:</p><li> <strong>  Build an emergency fund. </strong>  If you&rsquo;re in an industry that&rsquo;s facing disruption, it&rsquo;s important to have enough cash to cover 6 months of your current spending if you need to make a transition. One of the most important things you can do during a job search is maintain your dignity. Having an emergency fund can keep you from accumulating debt (no borrowing from your parents or racking up charges on your credit cards) and give you the support you need to make the best possible decisions when it comes to a change in your career.</li><li> <strong>  Diversify, diversify, diversify. Personally and financially. </strong> As things shift, it&rsquo;s important to embrace change. Educate yourself. Learn new skills. Take charge, leverage new opportunities, and never, ever, put all your eggs in one basket! And when it comes to investing, take a lesson from the  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal\" target=\"_blank\">   Enron scandal  </a> </u> . Few people would risk investing in a single company, but investing in a single industry can be just as detrimental. By investing in great companies and allocating assets among various industries, demographics, and geographies, you can hedge the risk of a major disruption in any single sector.</li><li> <strong>  Continue to invest for the long term. </strong>  Keep your eyes on your goals when it comes to your career and your financial outlook. Remember that even when volatility exists, the economy is on a steady upward climb. In the US, our economic data is better than it&rsquo;s been in years. Unemployment is down to 5.1%&mdash;the lowest it&rsquo;s been since early 2008. The GDP and housing starts are both continuing on a steady climb, and consumer confidence levels have rebounded. So take control of your investments, make non-emotional smart choices, and Invest in yourself while consistently building your wealth&mdash;regardless of changes around you. <br/>  </li><p> Whenever societal changes reach the tipping point, the men and women who rise to the challenge are the big winners after the dust settles. So get excited about what&rsquo;s happening. Adapt as quickly as you can and take advantage of new advancements to create a better future for yourself (even if a self-driving car tries to steer you in another direction!). Remember, you&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat. It&rsquo;s time to jump in, be smart, and get ready for a wild and exciting ride!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 18:54:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 18:54:38.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_sdxHS66.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-new-age-of-opportunity/\", \"post_id\": \"8731\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 18:54:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 18:54:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-new-age-of-opportunity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8730\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4142\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-New-Age-of-Opportunity.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"990\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453581000,"author_id":341,"chart_url":""}

That&rsquo;s where my focus &mdash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://returnonrelationship.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Return on Relationship  </a> </u>  &mdash; got started, and I carried that into the social commerce explosion.</p><p> My advice to everyone is stop worrying about what&rsquo;s next, and execute on what&rsquo;s now. I see too many people looking too far out into the future. I am rarely the first guy on new platforms. It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m just waiting to see if they take hold. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m very busy executing in the current media. I&rsquo;m very present.</p><p> For me being future strong is about being fully present in the now. Who I am as a person is being very responsive. I need to get back to people. The best way to leverage social is to engage people, to have conversations, and the only way to do that is to be available for people. A lot of people don&rsquo;t think that interactivity can scale. I believe it can. To stay strong, I interact with the people who really want to interact with me. Because the extended trail of our interactions &mdash; through tweets, additional posts and more &mdash; creates vicarious participation for lots of others who can see or become part of our interacting. Ninety-eight percent of the people on social media are vicariously participating, by watching other people have conversations, and then feeling or being a part of that.</p><p> Another big part of who I am and what keeps me future strong is the concept of  <u>  <a href=\"http://begoodtopeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Be Good to People  </a> </u> . This is a movement started by Kris Wittenberg. I wear her t-shirts, I have her stickers on all my stuff. We met because I started the hashtag of  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/just_b_nice\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #JustBeNice  </a> </u> , and I preach this to companies. If you&rsquo;re nice to people, if you&rsquo;re employees are nice to people, if you treat your vendors well&hellip;it makes a very big difference in how you do business.</p><p> It&rsquo;s All About Who You Decide to Be: A while ago, I went through a four- year battle to keep my daughters in my life. It cost me everything I had. I had to rebuild after that. When it ended, I had lost a lot of years of my daughters lives and I was angry. And I woke up one morning and realized I don&rsquo;t want to be angry any more. I wanted to be happy. Children default to happy, but many adults do not. We default to angry, upset, and lots more. So I just made a decision to change my mindset. So I now do my best every day to live by this quote: Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it&rsquo;s about learning to dance in the rain. I do for others without any expectation of anything in return. That&rsquo;s at the heart of Return on Relationship because, in the end, that will come back to you, one way or another.</p><h3> What do leaders need to do to build Future Strong companies? </h3><p> <br/> The smarter companies are telling their employees: &ldquo;Build your personal brand&hellip; Make yourself better. Because the better you are, the better we are as a company.&rdquo; If you have one thousand employees, and every one of them has one hundred or one thousand followers on social channels &mdash; if those people like where they&rsquo;re working, think about the reach that you&rsquo;re getting.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/network-gives-you-reach-community-gives-you-power/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A network gives you reach, but a community gives you power  </a> </u> . If you build your employees into a community, the power you will get is astronomical! This is the Age of Influence, where anyone can build a brand, affect change, make a difference, 24/7 &mdash; without a big budget.</p><p> There is no line anymore between work and who you are as a human being.</p><p> Empathy is important. You need to better understand your employees.</p><p> We need leaders who are mentors and coaches vs. a boss.

When they grow up, empty-nesters face a decision about what to do with their extra money.</h3><p> <br/> What they choose is crucial to their retirement security for two reasons &ndash; one obvious, and one subtle but very important.</p><p> The Center for Retirement Research estimates that about  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IB_14-20-508.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   half  </a> </u>  of U.S. workers might not have enough savings to maintain their standard of living after they retire. So, the obvious thing to do after being freed from child-rearing obligations is to put more money into an employer retirement plan. But 401(k) saving increases only modestly after the kids leave home, according a  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/do-households-increase-their-savings-when-the-kids-leave-home/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  by the Center comparing empty-nesters with parents whose kids are still living at home.</p><p> The Center&rsquo;s researchers confirmed this finding using two separate sources of data on married households&rsquo; finances. One was a University of Michigan survey of nearly 2,500 households in which the man was over age 50, with financially independent offspring defined as those who are no longer living at home and, if they are college students, have not attended school continuously. The other was U.S. Census data on more than 40,000 adult households of all ages, with independence defined simply as over age 23.</p><p> The researchers found that soon after the kids are gone, the increases in 401(k) savings, as a percentage of household incomes, range from 0.3 percentage points to 1.0 percentage points, depending on the survey and the definition of dependents used. In any case, the additional amounts are small relative to what most empty-nesters would need to prepare for retirement. The researchers also found no meaningful increase in saving through two other avenues: non-401(k) accounts and  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/mortgage-payoff-freedom-vs-the-math/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   additional mortgage payments  </a> </u> .</p><p> The flip side of saving is spending, which also affects retirement security in a subtle but important way. If empty nesters decide to continue spending the same amount they did when the kids were living at home, the smaller household of two is actually raising its standard of living. This increase sets the bar higher for how much income the couple will require to maintain that standard of living after they retire.</p><p> After the kids leave, it&rsquo;s understandable that self-sacrificing parents might want to splurge a little on a trip, theater tickets, or an expensive hobby. But be sure to figure out how much to save and spend to adopt a sustainable standard of living for retirement.</p>The research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) funded as part of the Retirement Research Consortium.

Give yourself a pat on the back. The goal is to get to a place where you feel compassion towards yourself. Even if you&rsquo;ve made some bad money mistakes in the past, find something for which you can acknowledge yourself. Remember, you were, and are, doing the best you can with what you know.</p><p> Women sometimes need permission to be kinder to themselves. Many times women don&rsquo;t even realize how harsh they are with themselves, especially around money. When women realize they don&rsquo;t need to be so hard on themselves and that they can be more compassionate instead, it can be enough to take them out of their financial story. I have found that women have a tendency to create a lot of drama around money, perhaps because they get addicted to the adrenaline rush. They become self-critical and tell themselves stories about being a bad person because they have debt or because they over-spend or because they feel clueless about money. This is what keeps them feeling stuck.</p><h3> Instead, women can get to a place of forgiveness for the past money mistakes they have made.</h3><p> <br/> This forgiveness leads to feeling more empowered with money. When women feel empowered, they become aware of choices that they were not aware of before. They actually begin to create these choices for themselves out of the new, empowered space because they become more creative and resourceful.</p><p> From that point, they become more aware of their money behaviors so that the next time they feel compelled to spend money mindlessly, they can be at choice, which in turn breaks the negative cycle of their money story. The story usually goes something like this: They spend unconsciously, then feel guilty and berate themselves, so they feel badly about themselves, which then leads to feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. It becomes a habitual pattern of self-abuse.</p><p> The good news is that, amazingly, the simple process of becoming aware of unconscious patterns with money, and forgiving oneself for unwanted financial behavior, is enough to begin to break and transform the negative cycle.</p><p> This blog post is an excerpt from the soon-to-be-released book, Super Charge Your Success, co-authored by Patti Fagan.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 19:56:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 19:56:08.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_A7pbLE1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-women-can-overcome-money-guilt/\", \"post_id\": \"8737\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 19:56:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 19:56:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-women-can-overcome-money-guilt\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8736\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4145\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Women-Can-Overcome-Money-Guilt.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1176\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453530600,"author_id":375,"chart_url":""}

Budget time for disruptions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Since you know that, sooner or later, at least one of your coworkers is going to interrupt you when you&rsquo;re in the middle of something, set some time aside specifically for that purpose.</p><p> In other words, don&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;re super close to deadline to get started on an assignment.</p><p> The earlier your start and finish projects, the more time you&rsquo;ll have to gab with your coworkers &mdash; even if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Listen to music </strong></h3><p> <br/> A super easy way to discourage colleagues from stopping by your desk to talk to you: stick headphones in your ears whenever you&rsquo;re busy, and play songs that make work easier.</p><p> As an added bonus, you&rsquo;ll be able to identify which coworkers think you can hear what they have to say even when you&rsquo;re listening to music.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Go for a walk </strong></h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-desk-exercises\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Exercise  </u> </a>  makes us more productive at work. Yes, that exercise can include something as easy as a 15-minute walk.</p><p> If your coworker has something they &ldquo;absolutely need to tell you right this second,&rdquo; ask whether that person would like to join you on a walk. That way, when you return to your desk, you&rsquo;ll be re-energized and ready to dive right back into work.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Change your presence status </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a reason you have the ability to change your presence status on your team messaging app.</p><p> While someone stopping by your desk when you&rsquo;re busy can certainly be annoying, you can never take digital disruptions with a grain of salt either.</p><p> A simple solution: change your presence status to indicate that you&rsquo;re busy when you are, and you should see digital disruptions subside.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Work from somewhere else </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve got a huge project due in a few days and you&rsquo;re struggling to make progress at the office, ask your boss whether you can work from home or the library.</p><p> Make it physically impossible for your coworkers to physically interrupt you, and they won&rsquo;t.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Don&rsquo;t disrupt your coworkers </strong></h3><p> <br/> Never forget the golden rule. If you don&rsquo;t want your coworkers to disrupt you, don&rsquo;t disrupt them. Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll notice your behavior and strive to mimic it.</p><p> Interacting with your coworkers is implicitly part of your job description. Though their unprovoked disruptions might bother you, it&rsquo;s just part of the game. By managing such disruptions, however, you&rsquo;re likely to maintain strong relationships with your colleagues without having to worry about taking work home or missing deadlines. It&rsquo;s a win-win for everyone.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 20:13:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 20:13:01.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_EL6UKfD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-tips-for-managing-disruptions-in-the-workplace/\", \"post_id\": \"8739\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 20:13:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 20:13:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-tips-for-managing-disruptions-in-the-workplace\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8738\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4146\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-Tips-for-Managing-Disruptions-in-the-Workplace.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"672\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453492800,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3997,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Ten Steps To Hosting a Successful Client Event","link":"the-ten-steps-to-hosting-a-successful-client-event","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> One of the most effective ways to show your clients how much you appreciate them, is through the hosting of a client event.</h3><p> <br/> This event can be with twelve clients and guests or up to twenty clients and guests. I wouldn&rsquo;t host events much larger than this because it tends to get impersonal. Events include dinners, attending sporting events, golf clinics and outings, wine-tasting, art exhibits with the artists, fly-fishing, bowling or whatever many of your clients enjoy doing.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter what event you host because if done right, the results are stellar. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how to host a restaurant event.  A client-appreciation luncheon or dinner can be organized within four weeks if you follow this checklist. This is the exact repeatable process I have used when I have coached other top producers and helped them coordinate these events. I have hosted more than 250 events nationwide, so I know exactly what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> <strong>  1. Location: </strong> Schedule a lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a private room. It should be a place that is easy to find, with plenty of parking, good food, and room for your guests. We have found the ideal group size to be between twenty-five and fifty people, which will make this intimate and comfortable for your guests. That is why a restaurant that is easy to get to can really set the stage for a successful event.</p><p> <strong>  2. Speaker and Date: </strong> If you decide to have a guest speaker talk during dinner and the talk should be during the meal, invite a very good speaker who will provide the presentation you need for the current market or a timely topic your clients would enjoy hearing about. This should be a brief, twenty to thirty-minute entertaining presentation, not a product pitch. Remember, this is an appreciation event, not a product-pushing night. If your speaker is outstanding, this event will be very enjoyable. If your clients have fun, business and referrals will often follow. Every time I have spoken at these events, the advisor has gained more business immediately following the event. So find a terrific speaker with an interesting topic and expect to have some fun.</p><p> <strong>  3. Coordinate Available Dates and Times: </strong> Make sure to check with the restaurant and your favorite speaker about their availabilities. Be sure that you have seen them speak to an audience before and know what the presentation will be. This is your event and you get the final say.</p><p> <strong>  4. Financing: </strong> If you do not want to cover the entire costs of the event, call your favorite wholesalers and ask if they will contribute to the cost of your event, if that is okay with your company and compliance. I have found that our business is about partnerships between you, your clients, and the wholesalers who sincerely take an interest in your success. These events are not expensive, by the way, and generally one or two wholesalers can cover the costs. If you are going to ask for wholesaler support, only ask those you give business to. This is a win-win relationship.</p><p> <strong>   5. Invitation List: </strong> Your goal is to have between twenty-five to fifty people at dinner. Clients, significant others, and guests combine for that total. List the clients within thirty minutes of the restaurant. Then, call them&frac14;yes&frac14;call to invite them to your client-appreciation dinner. This is an important difference from the way most people organized events like these in the past. Tell them that you are having a small gathering of some of your local clients and would like them to join you for a nice dinner or whatever event you decide to host. Give them the 5 Ws: who, what, where, when, and why. If you call them four to eight weeks before the event, you will know immediately who can attend and who cannot. Getting fifteen clients who say yes to your lunch or dinner usually means twenty-five to thirty people will attend, when you consider couples. Let them know that they are welcome to bring a guest and dinner is your treat, but it is not mandatory that they bring someone with them. One successful advisor says it this way.  \"Jim, you and Tracie have been great clients over the years and I'd like to invite you to a dinner we're hosting for a small number of our clients. You are welcome to bring a guest if you'd like and dinner will be my treat. Just let me know if you are bringing anyone besides Tracie, so that we have enough room for seating.\" Your guests may also need to be reminded that this is not a product pitch, but instead a fun evening with plenty of nice people and a delicious meal. I'm suggesting that you call to invite them to your event because calling your clients saves you time, money, and the hassle of mailing invitations and waiting for replies. By the way, I have been to client-appreciation events with two hundred people, but they are very impersonal and your clients will not ask questions nor will they mingle much. I have found the smaller events to be much more successful for you and a lot easier to organize. You may want to try a few smaller events and see for yourself. Calling them directly works very successfully and I know it firsthand. Some clients will not be able to join you, but they will still feel special because you invited them. Let them know that you'll invite them to another event in the near future. You have just touched them again and as you know, the best salespeople in the business \"touch\" their clients at least a dozen times each year.</p><p> <strong>  6. Confirm: </strong> Confirm with all those who have said yes to your invitation. Send an e-mail or invitation with all the details and the 5 Ws. Have your sales assistant call to confirm with your guests two days before the event. Some of your guests will cancel because of a scheduling conﬂict. Do not worry about it; just invite them to the next one.</p><p> <strong>  7. Arrive Early: </strong> I always like to arrive sixty to ninety minutes before the event to allow time for any surprises. Is the room set up correctly? If not, you have time to make the necessary changes. Also, check the temperature, lighting, sound, and overall comfort. Provide your personal biography or marketing page for everyone to read. (You should definitely have one of these by now.) Then meet and greet your guests, many of whom will start arriving twenty minutes before the event. Have fun and relax, because this is your dinner party for them. Begin the Event: Welcome everyone, share your \"elevator speech,\" and tell him or her what you have planned for the evening.</p><p> <strong>  8. Guest Speaker Presentation (optional): </strong> The presentation should be given while your guests are eating, not after they are finished. Many folks have been up since early morning and will get sleepy after the meal. The presentation may be important but not nearly as important as your clients' enjoyment. I have watched events when a guest speaker has spoken for sixty minutes after the coffee and dessert was served. It was a very sleepy audience. You also want a topic that your guests will find interesting or entertaining. A heavy topic like beta coefficient or the efficient frontier will not be much fun for anyone. These folks do not care about those things, because they have you as their expert. Find a speaker who can entertain and make this evening a great success for you and your guests. A twenty-minute market overview with some fun factoids can be completed while they eat their dinner. If you do it this way, the evening will last just about ninety minutes, and your clients will be much more alert and upbeat.</p><p> <strong>  9. Close the Event: </strong> Thank everyone for joining you, have a few rafﬂe prizes, and be sure to share a gift with the clients who have shared the most referrals with you in the past quarter. One advisor by the name of Jay Irving, closed the evening like this. He said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining us tonight and it looks like we've all had a lot of fun. I want to thank you for your loyalty, friendship, and, as importantly, your referrals. This has been one of my best years ever for referrals and I sincerely thank you. As we close this dinner tonight, I'd like to share a gift with one client who has given me the most referrals these past three months.\" Jay proceeded to give this client a spectacular gift basket with cheese, wine, books, and all sorts of fun stuff, in front of the entire room. It was a fantastic sight to see. What was especially amazing is that this client, who had given Jay five referrals, was worth eight million dollars. The client was so touched by Jay's kind gesture in front of the audience that he called Jay the next morning and gave three more referrals. Public praise goes a long way in all parts of life and it sends a message to others that you really appreciate referrals of people like them! This is an excellent way to let your clients know how much you like getting referrals!</p><p> <strong>  10. Follow-up: </strong> Send a thank-you note or e-mail and ask for feedback about your event. Also review what they liked and may want to hear about in the future. Review with your speaker and sales assistant as to what went well and what should be changed. Did your guests enjoy themselves? How was the speaker? Did the restaurant do as they promised? Plan the next one and have fun.</p><h3> This is a perfect time of the year to host an event.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a new year an easy way to catch up with your clients in person. If you host an event with less than twenty clients and guests, it isn&rsquo;t time consuming and is very rewarding. Not sure? Then try it and let me know how much fun you all had and how many referrals you gained.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 21:05:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 21:05:29.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_JvIYtWe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-ten-steps-to-hosting-a-successful-client-event/\", \"post_id\": \"8740\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 21:05:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 21:05:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-ten-steps-to-hosting-a-successful-client-event\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8738\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4147\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-Tips-for-Managing-Disruptions-in-the-Workplace.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1804\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453466700,"author_id":362,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3998,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Ways to Find a Soul Mate","link":"6-ways-to-find-a-soul-mate","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> \"Before you find your soul mate, you must first discover your soul.\"</h3><p> <br/> A search for a soul mate, to me, is like going to a romantic movie and yearning for your life to be just as the characters.  In these movies, living happily ever after lasts about ninety to one-hundred and twenty minutes. What happens next? Next week? Next year? Ten years from now? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am a romantic and love romantic love. But the idea of a soul mate has always made me wonder.  </p><p> To me, we possess a duality&mdash;a primitive nature and a divine nature. The latter is where our soul resides. When we look outside of ourselves for &ldquo;completion&rdquo; that signals a pursuit directed by our primitive nature and our soul takes a place in the background. Usually looking for the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; mate takes the shape of a to-do or wish list.  Our primitive nature is forever insecure as its primary purpose is to insulate us from danger. And if you are waiting or looking for a soul mate, I suggest you honestly evaluate your requirements. You will see that they fit some criteria in order to make you feel safer.</p><p> Rather than a soul mate, strive for a soulful relationship. That is one in which both partners do not need each other. Lasting, happy, soulful relationships are not needy ones. Our divine nature does not need anything accept for release from the bounds of our frightened, primitive nature, which keeps it down and hidden. Once each party in the relationship releases their soul, the two together are greater than the sum of their individual parts. And that is the making of an enduring relationship.</p><h3> So here are six suggestions to help you. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Do something every day that is in alignment with a skill or talent you have </strong></li><li> <strong>  Upon awakening each day, close your eyes and visualize a healthy, fit body </strong></li><li> <strong>  Never meditate or visualize what your &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; mate would look like </strong></li><li> <strong>  Meditate daily for at least five minutes daily </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do not put a timeframe on meeting someone </strong></li><li> <strong>  Release fear with affirmations as, &ldquo;I will always find a way and a way will always find me.&rdquo; </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Nurturing your divine nature will help you attract those people into your life that are right for you. When you first discover your soul, you will be free to begin a soulful relationship. And there is no better way to live your everyday extraordinary than to share it with someone whom you love.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 21:25:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 21:25:25.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_s3sFHZg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-ways-to-find-a-soul-mate/\", \"post_id\": \"8743\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 21:25:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 21:25:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-ways-to-find-a-soul-mate\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8738\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4149\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6-Tips-for-Managing-Disruptions-in-the-Workplace.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"704\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453493700,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3999,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Good Selling = Good Relating","link":"good-selling-good-relating","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> In business, just as in real life, good relationships matter. It&rsquo;s a simple truth that a lot of businesspeople tend to forget.</h3><p> <br/> Many place a high premium on networking and fail to give proper care to the relationships that they have already created. While networking can certainly help build awareness and make new sales, the success of your business should not be measured by the number of names in your contact list. No matter whether your business is customer-driven or client-driven, its success or failure is ultimately defined by the quality of the relationships that you have with your &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;.</p><p> When the question comes to customer acquisition vs. retention, the winner is obvious. Customer profitability tends to increase over the life of a retained customer, and acquiring new customers can cost as much as five times more than satisfying and retaining current customers, as pointed out by Emmet C. Murphy, Ph.D., and Mark Murphy in their book &lsquo;Leading on the Edge of Chaos: Positive Leadership in a Volatile Economy&rsquo;. The cost of acquisition is high, so once a relationship is established, it is much more profitable to nurture it, than to just move on to the next one.</p><h3> Relationship maintenance is crucial in business because like our social relationships, business relationships can weaken over time if neglected.</h3><p> <br/> Think about it; if a friend whom you haven&rsquo;t seen in years calls on you asking for a big favor, how likely will you be to agree to donate your time or money to this person? The same holds true in business: You cannot leave a business relationship unattended for a time and expect your customers to come running to you next time you need to make a sale.</p><p> Customers who don&rsquo;t feel valued and cared for are not likely to remain loyal. According to 1st Financial Training Services,  <u>  96% of unhappy customers don&rsquo;t complain; however, 91% of those simply leave and never come back </u> . It&rsquo;s very easy to lose a customer, and there are multiple ways in which both business owners and sales people can sabotage themselves &ndash; showing no customer appreciation, pushing a sale on a prospect regardless of whether they need it or not, and betraying customers&rsquo; trust are just a few of them.</p><p> Although salespeople get a bad reputation for exactly those things, a good salesman would never do anything of the sort. In fact, successful salespeople would tell you that sustainable or &ldquo;good&rdquo; sales practice is all about client retention and relationshipbuilding; getting to know your prospects and working with them as colleagues and collaborators is far more important than just making the sale and moving on. A number of business benefits can be achieved through &ldquo;good&rdquo; selling and proper customer relationship management:</p><li> <strong>  Customer loyalty </strong></li><li> <strong>  Positive word of mouth (WOM) </strong></li><li> <strong>  New clientele </strong></li><li> <strong>  Desirable image </strong></li><li> <strong>  Long-lasting success </strong> <br/>  </li><p> So what do savvy businesspeople do in order to forge strong and lasting relationships with their prospects and clients? The answer is really simple, although it might come as a surprise to some &ndash; they treat their customers as they would treat their friends, or themselves for that matter. &ldquo;Good&rdquo; selling is all about:</p><li> <strong>  Prioritizing quality over quantity, because not every new relationship is going to be equally promising. </strong> No, you don&rsquo;t need everyone to be your customer; you need your relationships to reflect your values and beliefs, and to reinforce the image that you have created for yourself and your business. Relationships that you choose to maintain will require much of your time and attention, so make sure that you are able to devote yourself 100% to them even after the sale.</li><li> <strong>  Establishing a dialog, because relationships are a two-way street. </strong> People don&rsquo;t like to feel that they are being forced into doing things, so pushing a sale on a customer will do no good to your relationship. Instead of making an impression on your prospects with a strong sales pitch, opt for a softer approach that is less likely to make them feel pressured to buy something from you. Talk to them, make them feel welcomed and relaxed, and find out what they need: what problem they are trying to solve, and what is the best way to help them. If you are able to have an open dialog with your prospects, there is a greater chance of their becoming your customers in the future, as well as more room for the relationship to grow.</li><li> <strong>  Maintaining patience, because trusting relationships don&rsquo;t happen overnight. By rushing your prospects or putting pressure on them, you will not achieve the quality relationship that you desire. </strong> In order to win people&rsquo;s trust, you need to prove your loyalty to them first &ndash; and this may take time.</li><li> <strong>  Building trust, because without it relationships fail quickly and customer loyalty is impossible to achieve. </strong> The more personalized you make your relationships, the more likely you are to win your customers&rsquo; trust. Honesty and openness are key, as even a suspicion of deception or manipulation can ruin the relationship. If you are not sincere with your customers, they will find out eventually &ndash; and with the proliferation of social medial these days it is easier than ever &ndash; and then you will never make another sale to them again. Definitely not worth it.</li><li> <strong>  Practicing empathy to gain insight into the customers&rsquo; perspective and serve them better. </strong> Empathy is about relating to the other person&rsquo;s situation and feelings, as if they were your own. Once you have that understanding, it is easier to build deeper and stronger relationships with people.

{"original_id":4000,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Four Things Employees Need Most From Leaders","link":"four-things-employees-need-most-from-leaders","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Research indicates that employees have three prime needs: Interesting work, recognition for doing a good job, and being let in on things that are going on in the company.&rdquo; &mdash;Zig Ziglar </strong></p><p> What do your employees need most from the leaders in your organization? In the above quote, Zig Ziglar shares three employee needs based on research results. While I definitely agree with these needs, based on my experience I would like to suggest there are four additional things that employees need from leaders. If you take a moment to put yourself in their shoes, you realize that your employees have the same needs that you have. These are actually the same needs that people have no matter who they are, what their occupation is, or where they reside. They want to know that they make a difference, that someone cares, and that they belong. So, what four things do employees need most from leaders?</p><h3> <strong>  To be valued </strong></h3><p> <br/> First of all, employees need to know that their leaders value them. I&rsquo;m not talking about just valuing that the task they have been assigned gets completed. I&rsquo;m talking about genuinely valuing them as individuals. They each have something unique to offer. Their contributions matter and they need to know that you recognize and appreciate their expertise, their experience, and their potential. Learn to truly value every employee on an individual level.</p><h3> <strong>  To be respected </strong></h3><p> <br/> As a leader, you want to be respected. Well, your employees also have a need to be treated with respect. They don&rsquo;t want to feel taken advantage of or that they are being taken for granted. Every employee is part of your organization for a reason. No one person&rsquo;s reason is any more important than another&rsquo;s. Every employee plays an integral role in accomplishing organizational goals and achieving success as a whole. Treat them with the respect that they need and deserve.</p><h3> <strong>  To be trusted </strong></h3><p> <br/> No one likes to feel like they are not trusted to do the job they have been hired to do. When you micromanage your employees you are sending the message that you do not trust their ability or their judgment. Employees will never reach their full potential unless you learn to put your trust in them. Give them the training and access to resources that they need, then step out of the way and trust them to do their jobs.</p><h3> <strong>  To be part of a community </strong></h3><p> <br/> People need to feel like they belong. This applies to home, community, and the workplace. Employees need to know that they are part of something bigger than themselves, that they belong to a larger community of individuals working toward the same goals, and that they are making a meaningful contribution. Create a strong community in your organization and then make sure every employee feels that they are an important part of it.</p><h3> <strong>  Give Them What They Need </strong></h3><p> <br/> Employees are simply happier, more satisfied, more loyal, and more productive when leaders in the workplace are meeting their needs. Make sure that employees are being valued on an individual basis. Treat every employee with respect. Show them, through your words and actions, that you have trust in their abilities and judgment. And, create an organizational community where every employee has a sense of belonging. Step up your leadership and give your employees what they need.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 22:07:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 22:07:06.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_dkETljf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/four-things-employees-need-most-from-leaders/\", \"post_id\": \"8746\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 22:07:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 22:07:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"four-things-employees-need-most-from-leaders\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8747\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4151\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Four-Things-Employees-Need-Most-From-Leaders.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"684\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453478400,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4001,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Writing Your Letter To Self","link":"writing-your-letter-to-self","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> If you haven't written a Letter To Self yet this year, do it now. Here's why.</h3><p> <br/> The other evening, after a somewhat exhausting day, I sat down by the fireplace and decided to peek at Facebook for a few minutes before calling it a night. As I glanced through updates from friends and family, a message popped onto my screen:</p><p> <strong>  Christi - I couldn't wait to even find my work email where I've got your email address stored to message you. Just got my note I wrote a year ago to myself and that may be the most powerful piece of mail I've ever received. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. </strong></p><p> A bit of context: </p><p> Early last year, I asked our  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/ASPIRESuccessClub.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ASPIRE Success Club </a>  members to write a letter to themselves. \"I'm only going to give you three minutes,\" I explained, \"so no overthinking. I just want you to quickly write a few lines to yourself that will bring a smile to your face if you were to open it at the end of the year - something that acknowledges your beautiful self and that celebrates the amazing year you're about to have.\" I then had them each self-address an envelope, place her letter inside, seal it up, and leave it with me. Nothing more was said.</p><p> Towards the end of December, we mailed all the letters out. On or near New Year's Eve day, each ASPIRE member had that moment of confusion when first seeing something in her own handwriting waiting in the mailbox, :-) followed by the joyful experience of reading the encouraging letter she had written so many months before.</p><p> I have done this exercise with groups many times and the results are always astounding; this time was no exception. I received numerous emails and calls explaining how meaningful and deeply profound that experience of writing by hand, then forgetting about, then reading this compassionate, celebratory Letter To Self is. I save - and savor - each of these messages.</p><p> One in particular, however, impacted me deeply this year. I've known Lacey Schmidt for about twelve years. She attended a class I taught through community education when first starting my business and has been an inspiring client, colleague, and friend ever since. </p><p> This past year has been a bit tumultuous for Lacey, to say the least: When she wrote that letter to herself in ASPIRE, she was in the midst of a difficult divorce, had two boys under the age of three, and was about to be offered an opportunity to move halfway across the country for a promotion she had earned. The Letter To Self exercise came at a time when Lacey's life felt somewhat uncertain and chaotic - but she also knew that uncertainty and chaos weren't her \"essence.\" She reached deep within for this assignment, writing:</p><p> <strong>  Hey You, </strong></p><p> <strong>  Whoa. What a year. Could more have fit into this incredible journey year to more strength, wisdom, courage, and love? You've experienced it all - and came out shining. You want to be YOU and that was the most important focus you had a year ago when you didn't want to be...well, anywhere. You came out focused, fighting, and with superhero posture. You've done all that seemed impossible with grace, charisma, and inspiration. You've helped others. You are growing your boys into incredible young men. You've not lost sight of yourself or given up or compromised your values, priorities, or essentially what matters most. You have transformed.  </strong></p><p> <strong>  I am so proud of you and excited for all the next year will bring. What will you do now? Who will you continue to grow and become? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Love, </strong> <br/> <strong>  Me </strong></p><p> Wow. Powerful words, wouldn't you say? Especially coming at a time of such difficulty and uncertainty.</p><p> So, when I received Lacey's private message on Facebook, I immediately responded, thanking her for letting me know what a meaningful experience the Letter To Self exercise was for her. She wrote back:</p><p> <strong>  It was such a hard, hard year. Yet, what I set out here [in this letter] and was really focused on all year (even if I forgot the exact words) came true. </strong></p><h3> Therein lies the power of the Letter To Self exercise, and I encourage anyone reading this article to do it.</h3><p> <br/> Close your eyes for a moment and place yourself at the end of the year. Consider what you want to be feeling at that time, who you want to be and how you want to show up in the world. Then, from that expansive place, write a letter to yourself - short, positive, and in your own handwriting. Seal it up and either give it to a trusted friend to mail to you at the end of December or put it somewhere (maybe with your Christmas decorations) where you won't see it again until year-end. Then, forget it.</p><p> You will be amazed at what this experience creates for you. Absolutely amazed. We did this in ASPIRE again this year, and it will likely become an annual part of our curriculum. </p><p> Take three minutes and do this, right now. You won't regret it.</p><p> I'll close this article with Lacey's final comment before we signed off of Facebook for the night. What she wrote next brought goosebumps to my arms and tears to my eyes:</p><p> As I said to some friends, if you want to bring yourself to your knees, write a letter to yourself, forget about it, and have it sent to you a year later. And realize all of what you wrote and forgot about came true.</p><p> Most days, it doesn't feel like any of this is true. When I read it though, I know it's the exact truth. So perfect. And much needed. I can't thank you enough.</p><p> Thank YOU, Lacey, for knowing your exact truth, for sharing your experience, and for allowing me to share it with others.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 22:15:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 22:15:11.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_iW86y9o.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/writing-your-letter-to-self/\", \"post_id\": \"8749\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 22:15:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 22:15:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"writing-your-letter-to-self\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8748\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4152\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Writing-Your-Letter-To-Self.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"418\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453485600,"author_id":150,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4002,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Leaders Know How to Let Their Company Sell a Naked Product","link":"leaders-know-how-to-let-their-company-sell-a-naked-product","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Times of excessive margins are history. Every entrepreneur, CEO or CFO knows that by now.</h3><p> <br/> Organisations need to operate with lower budgets, costs need to be decreased to acceptable levels for business continuity. Companies have been confronted with this unruly reality for a few years. What is causing that reality? What changes would create a new balance for business continuity? Recognising this profound uncertainty, every organisation should stress the importance of making decisions when the time is right. In this article I hope to give you some insights on how to deal with the current turbulent market circumstances and the constantly changing customer&rsquo;s demand.</p><p> Nowadays information is available for everyone. Hardly any information stays confidential &ndash; no trade secret is kept. Ins and outs about producing techniques, inventions, strategies, technologies and so on, are for the taking. Essential parts can be copied as far as a patent allows you to. Or a (legal) work-around is created as a framework for the elaboration of a company&rsquo;s own bright ideas to match up to the original innovation.</p><h3> Smart customers require smarter stories</h3><p> <br/> With customers knowing that production is or can be cheaper than they initially thought, a lot of organisations have been disarmed. Competition is on the rise. More and more start-ups compete with the traditional styles of doing business. They can do this by using smarter operational models and connection technology on the one hand, on the other hand by the ability to meet market price demands.</p><p> What does this mean? With so much information available most false bottoms have been revealed, end users will not &ndash; knowingly and willingly &ndash; pay the bizarre margins. Consumers can now distinguish relevance and nonsense perfectly. Therefore companies have to develop that same skill and apply it even better. Ask yourself, what is important for my business? More pivotal is the why-question. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.&rdquo; as Simon Sinek described in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   his inspirational TED talk  </a> </u>  about leadership and a golden Circle.</p><h3> Leaders need to take critical decisions vigorously</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s always a comparable or cheaper alternative people can change over to. Why should they buy from you? What is your story, what makes you the most authentic choice? <br/> You need to be able to sell the naked product &ndash; no mishmash. This requires a different operating model, a different leadership style. Not only minimising costs and mitigating internal risks are the issues here. Agility to react on market demand and the unpredictable environment is crucial. Organisations that can make critical decisions when the timing is right have enormous advantages. They will have the opportunity to capture markets and compete with companies that keep on managing their future business as if their environment is considerably predictable.</p><p> Why does this need a different way of operating? What do you need to change in your company to come towards the why-answers? Organisations need to build capabilities that are needed to surface critical issues early. They need to implement processes to determine how issues are raised, what sounding board will deliver feedback and how decisions will be made. A good start for setting up these processes would be to gather knowledge, to conduct the needed research, and analyse the implications. Such approach and change should be encouraged with the right leadership style. Let go of the power play by senior managers. Businesses need to move toward a more dynamic management style.</p><h3> Change the leadership style</h3><p> <br/> This requires significant shifts in the way companies operate. This style of leadership is about &lsquo;together&rsquo; and &lsquo;sharing&rsquo;, about team spirit. Managers as respected company servants and enablers, not as powerful dictators. Top down style is useless,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/leiderschap/create-join-business-ecosystems-survive-knowledge-era/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   changing behaviour across the supply chain  </a> </u>  requires much more. The most effective leader is a listener, a motivator, a giver. He or she knows how to give space in relationship with employees. The collaboration with other managers is just as essential. No deals but partnerships. How effective executives contribute to the success of others influences a company&rsquo;s organisational, cultural, and political standards and values, and will impact the whole transition. The knowledge and skills that suits this style of leadership makes these leaders better qualified than anyone else to act decisively when circumstances require this.</p><p> Continuous performance is not enough anymore. Leaders have to reinvent themselves constantly. That is agility. That is making your company agile thus successful.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 22:26:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 22:26:34.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_AbKEMoM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/leaders-know-how-to-let-their-company-sell-a-naked-product/\", \"post_id\": \"8751\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 22:26:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 22:26:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"leaders-know-how-to-let-their-company-sell-a-naked-product\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8750\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4153\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Leaders-Know-How-to-Let-Their-Company-Sell-a-Naked-Product.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"748\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453474800,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}

Create objectives and understand what your audience want and need </strong></p><li> Understand the purpose of your content &ndash; do you want to increase traffic, increase page views or boost brand awareness?</li><li> What are your competitors doing? What can you tell your audience that they can&rsquo;t?</li><li> Know your audience better than you know yourself &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30907/9-Questions-You-Need-to-Ask-When-Developing-Buyer-Personas.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   develop  </a> </u>  in-depth prospect personas that help you plan your content <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2.   Embrace context marketing </strong></p><li> The Internet gives marketers endless free customer date, so embrace this data and use it to deliver the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.apptentive.com/blog/context-marketing-is-the-new-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   right message  </a> </u> , to the right person, via the right medium at the right place and at the right time</li><li> Develop a process to connect with prospects based on their behaviour patterns; understand what motivates them</li><li> Move beyond campaigns to interactions &ndash; slick consumer campaigns no longer convert customers like they used to. Take the time to interact with your prospects. If Westpac can tweet back, why can't you? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3.

{"original_id":4004,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Strategy Withstands the Test of Time","link":"why-strategy-withstands-the-test-of-time","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How often have you heard people say, &ldquo;Our strategy is to become the biggest and the best?&rdquo; This is not strategy. Strategy is not the what. <strong>  Strategy is the how &ndash; how will you become the biggest and the best? </strong> Of course, within the realm of the definition, there are good strategies and bad ones. Good strategies help to define a company or a brand&rsquo;s point of difference. But that seldom happens without sacrifice, without giving up something to strengthen the chosen niche.</p><h3> <strong>  You Can&rsquo;t Be All Things to All People. Or Can You? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Today, shareholder and customer demands have never been greater. Leaders and managers are expected to do more, to do it better, faster, and at lower costs. Strategic focus is taking a backseat because people find strategy constraining. They won&rsquo;t admit it, but they secretly want to be all things to all people. Hence, their quest to seek every opportunity to boost sales and profit.</p><p> Most of these opportunities fall outside of the core competency of the company and/or the positioning of the brand. The fallout? An organization taken in several non-strategic directions.</p><h3> <strong>  Business Models Change and So do Core Competencies </strong></h3><p> <br/> By its very nature, strategy is constraining. That said, business models need not be static. At one time every brick and mortar merchant keen to enter e-retailing had to figure out digital commerce. Many, like Wal-Mart and Target, sourced the competency from 3rd parties. Although late to the dance,  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/11/target-walmart/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Walmart and Target  </a> </u>  are now making huge strides as their own know-how develops.</p><p> Social media is a new model in which brand positioning is not only misunderstood, it is ignored. When social media types talk strategy, they talk media strategy &ndash; who to target, how to reach the target, and how to maximize engagement. Engagement is critical, but not at the expense of sticking to brand/company&rsquo;s character and core positioning. This is what guides content. Inherent in that is content constraint &ndash; for good reason. Those who thrive on creativity need not be deterred. These constraints better define the brand&rsquo;s relationship with customers.</p><h3> <strong>  Today&rsquo;s business world is a complex place. Strategy cuts through the clutter. Here are 5 reasons why great strategies withstand the test of time: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Great strategies define the playing field.  </strong> To some, a playground without boundaries is glorious. That&rsquo;s what you get without strategic clarity. Now, try to run a company in which people can pursue any opportunity they like. Your organization will become dysfunctional, bloated, and ill-defined by employees and customers. </li><li> <strong>  Great strategies tell you what not to do.  </strong> Back in the 1980&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/06/24/will-pepsicos-diversification-help-it-outperform-coca-cola/\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Coca-Cola  </u>    </a> divested everything in their portfolio that you could not drink. This strategy of category constraint continues. Coke isn&rsquo;t wasting time assessing non-beverage markets or searching for food acquisitions. They&rsquo;re using that time to get better at non-alcoholic beverages. The proof is in the numbers; Coke&rsquo;s profit and market cap consistently outpaces their beverage and food rival, PepsiCo. </li><li> <strong>  Great strategies enhance expertise. </strong>  At one time I worked on a global assignment for beer giant, Interbrew, the precursor to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ab-inbev.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Anheuser-Busch InBev  </a> </u> . This gig afforded me the opportunity to meet CMOs from all over the world. Never did we discuss anything other than beer. Imagine the know-how that emanates from giving 100% of your attention to one category than juggling the needs of ten others. This is the power of focus.</li><li> <strong>  Great strategies create long-term stability.  </strong> When strategic intent is clear and concise, it provides the impetus for uncovering long-term opportunities. Because Nestl&eacute; defined their core competency as convenience coffee rather than instant coffee, they were able to pioneer an entirely new category rather than flog a dead horse. Today, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso\" target=\"_blank\">   Nespresso  </a> </u>  innovation generates $5+ billion in new revenue.</li><li> <strong>  Great strategies guide short-term execution. </strong>  Promotions that drive short-term sales ought to be connected to the brand&rsquo;s positioning. Red Bull does an awfully good job of this. In keeping with Red Bull&rsquo;s image, every event goes to the extreme, from thrilling space jumps to daring sports stunts. These promotions fortify the emotional claim that &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/red-bull-settles-false-advertising-lawsuit-for-13-million-2014-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Red Bull gives you wings  </a> </u> .&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Of course this is all for not without disciplined leaders with the passion to guide their team in the direction indicated by the strategic compass.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-21 22:37:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-21 22:37:56.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ql1QzKK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-strategy-withstands-the-test-of-time/\", \"post_id\": \"8754\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-21 22:37:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-21 22:37:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-strategy-withstands-the-test-of-time\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8752\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4155\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Turn-Content-Marketing-Into-a-Flawless-Habit.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"373\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453489200,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}

He holds up an egg and says, &ldquo;This is your brain.&rdquo; Next he turns to a hot frying pan on a stove and says, &ldquo;This is drugs.&rdquo; He then cracks open the egg, fries it, and says, &ldquo;This is your brain on drugs.&rdquo; Finally he looks up at the camera and asks, &ldquo;Any questions?&rdquo;<u> Brain On Drugs Video</u> (click to view the PSA)Why is a wealth management firm talking about brains getting fried like eggs? It&rsquo;s to remind everyone that powerful stimulants can impact our investment behavior. Drugs are stimulants, for sure, but so is money, especially when money is the focus of emotional media and unsettling headlines (see examples below).Last week, <u> <a href=\"http://wealthmanagement.com/blog/your-brain-money?NL=WM-27&amp;Issue=WM-27_20160121_WM-27_490&amp;sfvc4enews=42&amp;cl=article_7&amp;utm_rid=CPG09000002658253&amp;utm_campaign=4807&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;elq2=34f722023d034266ba113e72f7274b75\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  WealthManagement.com </a></u> published a story discussing just how powerful a stimulant money can be. The daily brief gives an overview of a book out by Kabir Sehgal, Coined.The following is taken directly from the transcript of Mr. Sehgal&rsquo;s YouTube video for The Big Thing that highlights his book:<strong> &ldquo;I looked at the topic of what&rsquo;s happening in the brain when we deal with money. And there&rsquo;s a part of the brain that activates &mdash; it&rsquo;s called the nucleus accumbens. It&rsquo;s deep within the sort of evolutionary, the oldest part of the brain. I looked at studies that compared people who make money to those who are high on cocaine. Remarkably, the brain scans were almost identical.&rdquo;</strong><h3> Yes, your brain gets fried on drugs and it also gets fried on money.</h3>Stoking an emotionally charged headline or two, Sehgals goes on to say:<strong> &ldquo;I also looked at brain scans of the people who are high looking at naked women, dead bodies and money. And what got the most activation? Money.&rdquo;</strong>See <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYMoYW9uOfw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  What Excites You The Most </a></u> to view the complete videoMany studies have shown that investors are more stimulated and feel more pain when they experience losses than when they experience gains. Even without the research, however, I think we  know instinctively that we can get anchored on our failures instead of our successes or all the things we have to be thankful for.Coming back around to the stock market, we have certainly experienced a few emotionally-charged down days year-to-date.Just as it is almost impossible to resist slowing down and taking a look at a car wreck, it is very difficult to resist sensational headlines like:<strong> &ldquo;Total Fail!&rdquo;</strong><strong> &ldquo;U.S. Stocks Post Worst 10 Day Start In History&rdquo;</strong>Why don&rsquo;t we see more headlines illustrating how markets tend to have solid rebounds off 10 day downturns, which reward long-term, patient investors?My favorite so far from today is the following, which is both emotionally charged and inaccurate:<strong> &ldquo;Stock Exchanges Plunge Into Bear Market Territory&rdquo;</strong>I will not mention the well-respected daily financial paper that published the headline above, but will remind you all that a bear market is a 20% drop, not a 10% drop.Being down 10% certainly gets our neurons firing. I encourage everyone to remember, however, that 10% drops are not uncommon. Think about the old saying, &ldquo;Investors create 50 year floods every 5 years&rdquo; (yes, it&rsquo;s OK to smile when you think about the words &ldquo;investors create&rdquo;).We are getting calls from clients and fellow professionals asking our opinion about where the market will go next. I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball, but I am willing to make the following predictions. If you continue to see the market drop, you will see:<li> More sensational headlines that are designed to sell ads, but not conducive to good investing</li><li> Wall Street, which loves volatility, not missing out on the opportunity to sell a trade or a product when anxiety is high</li><li> Sales pitches for expensive downside protection products and hedging strategies</li>If and when these predictions come to pass, to paraphrase another drug-related PSA, &ldquo;Just Say No&rdquo;Finally, below is a chart that I hope will help us all feel better about the emotions we&rsquo;re feeling (professional investors included).<img alt=\"\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-22-at-7.24.07-AM.png\" width=\"546\"/>Just yesterday, two clients, who consistently push us to buy on big down days, called to make sure we were not buying this time. Instead, they wanted us to place what they acknowledged would be inefficient and expensive downside protection trades. I told them that we didn&rsquo;t recommend this and, when they pushed back, reminded them of the following quote:<strong> &ldquo;It is the long-term investor, he who most promotes the public interest, who will in practice come in for most criticism&hellip;  For it is in the essence of his behavior that he should be eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy.&rdquo; - John Maynard Keynes</strong>We aren&rsquo;t sure what the next few weeks or months will bring, but &ldquo;alarmed&rdquo; and &ldquo;frightened&rdquo; comments (see the above graph) from seasoned investors can mean it&rsquo;s a time to stay away from the market frying pan and make sure you don&rsquo;t get fried by selling at the wrong time.<strong> To read more about advice we are giving to our clients, please read the following republished posts.</strong> They include research on how investors tend to underperform the market over the long term by making short term buy or sell decisions at the wrong time, along with a few rules for investing that we hope you will find helpful.<u> <a href=\"/advisor/keep-a-steady-hand-on-the-tiller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Keep A Steady Hand On The Tiller </a></u> (wrote this last Summer during another market bump that was China related)<u> <a href=\"/advisor/no-crystal-balls-just-peace-of-mind\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  No Crystal Balls </a></u> (includes charts and links to research showing how Wall Street and Federal Reserve prognostications are never in doubt but often wrong)","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-22 15:28:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-22 15:28:06.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ovDydzl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/your-brain-on-the-market/\", \"post_id\": \"8758\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-22 15:28:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-22 15:28:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"your-brain-on-the-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8756\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4159\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Your-Brain-On-The-Market.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"812\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453719600,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}

Bilbo was able to apply many effective strategies to dealing with Smaug which your sales team can use to deal with difficult customers. </p><p> Just because your most prickly customers don't literally breathe fire, destroy villages or guard magical hordes of gold and jewels, they do require special care. Before you and your salespeople feel the heat of a difficult client, rally the troops and pass on these four tactics. </p><h3> <strong>  1. SHOW RESPECT AND EMPATHY </strong></h3><p> <br/> When approaching a difficult customer as a sales rep, or in a supervisory management role, you want to check your emotions, load up on respect, and put yourself in your customer's shoes. Whether you are visiting your client in their office, or taking an escalation call over the phone, you want to rally behind your sales rep where possible, while paying respect to the customer's needs:</p><li> <strong>  To be heard, and for their business objectives to be taken seriously </strong></li><li> <strong>  For the product or service they invested in to meet the promises your company made when contracting </strong></li><li> <strong>  For their investment of time, energy and money to be respected </strong></li><li> <strong>  To be considered in the context of their reputation within their organization for buying from you, as well as the impact of your product or service in relation to their business' reputation </strong> <br/>  </li><p> You can show respect to a difficult customer by being on time, ensuring consistency of your messaging, and solving problems. </p><h3> <strong>  2. EFFECTIVE LISTENING AND UNDERSTANDING </strong></h3><p> <br/> When a sales rep is working with a difficult customer, there are a handful of reasons why they won't be the best listeners: </p><li> <strong>  They could be concerned how the dissatisfied customer will impact their future on your team </strong></li><li> <strong>  There may be other customer demands which may take a backseat to the difficult client </strong></li><li> <strong>  The sales rep may not be responsible for the customer's dissatisfaction, or they may be powerless to resolve it themselves </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Creating an open door policy on customer problems can help to diffuse challenging customer situations. Putting customer problems on the table early can help them be resolved, and help everyone move forward. </p><h3> <strong>  3. TAKE QUICK, DECISIVE ACTION </strong></h3><p> <br/> Establishing a pattern of hearing a customer problem, and then acting on it immediately is the best way to build respect, trust and diffuse a complicated situation.</p><p> Showing accountability and commitment to customer satisfaction as a sales manager is a great way to build customer rapport, and also sets a great example for your team at the same time. </p><h3> <strong>  4. YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO HOLD 'EM, KNOW WHEN TO FOLD 'EM </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you, your colleagues and sales reports have gone above and beyond the call, and the customer is still difficult to work with, you might need to cut your losses and move on. If you are negotiating with an existing customer, do your best to find a mutually acceptable end date for your relationship, and the terms of an acceptable set of circumstances to move on.</p><p> If you are talking to a prospect, and you don't see a realistic way to a productive, beneficial relationship with a customer, you are likely better off cutting ties, and moving on to other customer business. Ensure the prospect knows you appreciate the consideration, but make it clear your business isn't prepared to work with them on their terms.</p><p> If the prospect changes their \"tune\" and tries to re-establish a working relationship, they may have been testing your limits or they might just be difficult to work with in general. Proceed with caution, and consider the potential gain of working with a challenging customer relative to the extra time and care the customer needs. If your existing accounts might suffer because of a potential client not already on your books, cutting ties early is often the best way to go. </p><p> Once you and your client improve your working relationship at a management level, make sure you either build up their existing account manager to continue to maintain the relationship, or if possible, reassign them to a more senior rep. Either way, keeping tabs on the customer's situation from an arm's length is a good way to be ready to reassert yourself if the need arises. </p><p> Have you had success in applying a specific strategy to deal with complex customers? </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-23 02:29:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-23 02:29:44.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Sjy0lQy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-manage-difficult-customers/\", \"post_id\": \"8760\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-23 02:29:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-23 02:29:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-manage-difficult-customers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8759\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4160\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Manage-Difficult-Customers.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"894\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453539600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

In the midst of hors d&rsquo;oeuvres my friend Olga Botcharova casually mentions that she has worked with folks who have experienced trauma.</p><p> In the midst of hors d&rsquo;oeuvres my friend Olga Botcharova casually mentions that she has worked with folks who have experienced trauma.</p><p> <strong>  I have a Masters Degree in Conflict Resolution, </strong> Laura Sala, 1 of the guests I have not previously met, announces.</p><p> I only know one other person with a Conflict Resolution degree. Laura&rsquo;s mention drops us into a scintillating conversation about international conflict resolution, a topic that I am most passionate about. But here&rsquo;s the part I want you to get.</p><p> <strong>  I don&rsquo;t normally mention my Conflict Resolution degree, Laura explains. People have no idea what it is or how to respond when I mention it. </strong></p><h3> Laura&rsquo;s self-revelation is the unexpected turn. We notice. A group of folks does a together-turn.</h3><p> <br/> The moment of a conversational turn can slip away at the drop of a dime. Back to predictable. And the moment only happens when it is invoked.</p><p> The unexpected turn is easy, in a way, with someone we newly meet. A surprising self-revelation may do the trick. A past experience I share that doesn&rsquo;t match my current image. Interests I have that belie the trappings of where we are. A provocative mention that is not news to my friends but new to you because, well, we have only just met.</p><p> We need to say it, just as Laura needed to say it. A private thought invokes no directional change.</p><p> The unexpected turn is tougher in a well-oiled relationship. Predictable tends to reign in many workplace conversations. I anticipate what you will say before you say it. Predicable suggestions about strategy, about process improvement, about problem-solving, about just about everything.  Same old same old same old.</p><h3> How do we invoke the unexpected turn in familiar terrain?</h3><p> <br/> Court unexpected thought. Crave unfamiliar experiences. Unexpected thought is fueled by a voracious interest in new ideas, fresh research, staying informed, not merely by sources with a predictable point of view or a narrow field of inquiry. Unfamiliar experiences jolt us into a new awareness of ourselves. A client took me Go-Kart racing last week. I was confronted with the seduction of speed, my fear of a crash, my relationship to winning, body memories. Unfamiliar turf. Potent stuff.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be predictable, please. Spit it out, the surprise, the unexpected. Invoke the turn.</p><h3> Unexpected turns energize a conversation.</h3><p> <br/> They&rsquo;re a double win. I energize others. Others, in turn, energize me. We experience the joys of the together-turn.</p><p> <strong>  Turn freely, turn unexpectedly. The alternative isn&rsquo;t pretty. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-23 18:24:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-23 18:24:05.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_pvPjdN6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/invoke-the-unexpected-turn/\", \"post_id\": \"8762\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-23 18:24:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-23 18:24:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"invoke-the-unexpected-turn\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8761\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4161\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Invoke-the-Unexpected-Turn.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"762\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453744800,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

If you were comfortable with your portfolio at the end of December, there's no concrete reason not to like it now. Don't panic: volatility is not the same as risk. Don't make rash decisions without expert advice, and remember that this too shall pass. </p><h3> The second is understanding risk tolerance and risk premiums.</h3><p> <br/> Risk is the possibility that an investment will lose all its value because a company - or the investments a fund holds - are in trouble. Risk Tolerance is how much risk you are comfortable with. Risk Premium is the extra potential reward you get for investing in riskier instruments, such as equities, rather than lower-risk instruments such as bonds and cash. </p><p> If you believe that the stock market is efficient over the long-term, then you accept a certain level of risk in order to earn that premium. That probably won't prevent you from feeling anxious when the market is turbulent. It simply means that you accept volatility as part of the risk/reward equation. If the market is keeping you up at night, your portfolio is probably carrying too much risk and you may want to better align it with  <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/clients/index/809537908\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  your risk tolerance </a> .</p><h3> The third is to make sure you are getting trust-worthy advice.</h3><p> <br/> When the going gets tough, \"experts\" often get going. It's easy to feel anxious when the airwaves and internet are filled with talking heads predicting doom and gloom or, worse, surefire bets.</p><p> A good financial advisor does not suggest trying to time the market or reacting based on fear or anxiety.  A good financial plan is one that can weather volatility, matches your risk tolerance, has a risk-mitigation crisis plan already built in, and is based on a long term strategy, not a hasty reaction to short-term market ups and downs. </p><h3> If you're in the path of the storm, stay safe and drive carefully!</h3><p> <br/> And as we all weather the current market \"storms,\" remember that with a good financial plan in place, you'll feel comfortable about your strategy through calm weather and a little turbulence too. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-23 18:33:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-23 18:33:54.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_wlNuTwd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/winter-storm-jonas-isnt-the-only-turbulence-were-weathering/\", \"post_id\": \"8764\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-23 18:33:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-23 18:33:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"winter-storm-jonas-isnt-the-only-turbulence-were-weathering\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8763\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4162\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Winter-Storm-Jonah-Isnt-the-Only-Turbulence-Were-Weathering.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"813\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453741200,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

Who doesn&rsquo;t like a roaring bull market!</h3><p> <br/> But markets never rise in a straight line, and downturns, including violent selloffs, are a part of the investment landscape. We know they will come. We just don&rsquo;t know when.</p><p> I recently had the privilege of talking to two financial advisors. Advisor A told me he&rsquo;s had his clients in 90 percent cash since the start of the year. He doesn&rsquo;t try to call tops or bottoms but hopes to exit and re-enter near market peaks and troughs. It sounds simple.</p><p> <strong>  Advisor A </strong> said he anticipates a recession by mid-year. He plans to &ldquo;nibble&rdquo; at stocks following a 20 percent dip and get more aggressive when shares slide by 30 percent.</p><p> <strong>  Advisor B </strong> takes a different approach. She recently commented to me that when it comes to market-timing, you have to be right twice: <strong>  getting out and getting back in. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Advisor A </strong> did a good job of avoiding the turbulence at the start of the year.

Is it a well crafted and powerful response? No?  If you&rsquo;d like it to be set aside 15 minutes to do the following:</p><h3> Design it: <br/>  </h3><p> 1.  <strong>  Think about the benefits for the customer. </strong>  Don't talk about what you do but about what the customer gets.  Turn, \"I'm an accountant\"  into \"I keep Uncle Sam's fingers out of my clients wallets.\"</p><p> 2.  <strong>  Check your wording. </strong>  Make sure your words are concise &amp; active. No passiveness. Don't start with well, um, actually or just. These words don't belong anywhere let alone your elevator pitch. I do this with my first-time clients.  Role-playing, I ask them, \"what do you do?\" and they almost invariably start with an undermining passive word. Don't do this!</p><p> 3.  <strong>  Record yourself and relentlessly assess yourself: </strong>  Are you going down at the end of your sentences resulting in a strong, confident sound?

{"original_id":4012,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Nine Things That Won't Happen in FinTech This Year","link":"nine-things-that-wont-happen-in-fintech-this-year","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wescott_Capital\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Wescott Capital  </u> </a></p><h3> Given FinTech&rsquo;s surge in 2015, prognostications for next year have gotten pretty bold.</h3><p> <br/> We decided to take a different, more muted approach by offering predictions on things we do not expect to see this year. Here is our list:</p><p> <strong>  1) Financial services will avoid an Uber moment: </strong> Global financial services firms may have innovation problems, but the emergence of a dominant, death star company like Uber wiping them out isn&rsquo;t one. We also think that at least some banks and asset managers will start doing a better job of incorporating new technologies into their offerings. Finally, Uber has bolstered its dominating position by imposing its will on regulators and anyone else who has attempted to thwart it. Next year, we anticipate more aggressive counterpunching by established firms seeking to level the regulatory playing field in certain areas.</p><p> <strong>  2) The fintech bubble won&rsquo;t pop. </strong>  Valuations&mdash;especially in some B-to-C areas&mdash;look stretched, but we think great opportunities abound to fuel fintech momentum and capital formation next year. Plus, when compared to valuations seen in other tech sectors, fintech valuations seem less wild. Of the top 20 unicorns listed by CB Insights, there are only two fintech companies, Lufax and Stripe.</p><p> <strong>  3) Insurance tech will not be derailed by a myriad of regulations and complexity. </strong>  We are bullish on P&amp;C, Life and Auto insurance start-ups and believe that the challenges to disruption are more than offset by the huge opportunities to improve insurance. Big Data, cloud, crowdsourcing, mobile and IoT advancements will continue to be unleashed on a sector that is overdue for fresh products and solutions.</p><p> <strong>  4) Online lending platforms will not defy gravity in 2016. </strong>  The long-term future remains bright for online and marketplace lending platforms that have built scale or another defensible edge. However, we see gathering headwinds next year for both large and niche participants. Specifically, rates are rising, customer acquisition costs remain high and major new entrants&mdash;Goldman Sachs and The Blackstone Group&mdash;will be joining the hunt for attractive borrowers.</p><p> <strong>  5) ApplePay will not become the Michael Jordan of mobile payments. </strong>  Jordan may have been the NBA&rsquo;s greatest player, but he was a mediocre shortstop. Apple&rsquo;s digital wallet may fare better than Jordan&rsquo;s baseball career, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have brought its Jordan-style magic into the payments sector. Part of the challenge is that there are a slew of mobile wallet offerings that have balkanized the market. Apple, PayPal, Google and other mobile wallet providers will continue to fight for market share and build adoption, but we don&rsquo;t think that 2016 will be the year that any of them emerges above the rest.</p><p> <strong>  6) The biggest B-to-B breakout won&rsquo;t be found in Silicon Valley or Alley. </strong> It&rsquo;s in Seattle. We think start-ups focused on capital markets, regulation technology and data security will do particularly well next year. But the brightest enterprise star may be Amazon Web Services. As banks ramp-up their own digital offerings to beat back fintech challengers, many firms will turn to AWS solutions for support.</p><p> <strong>  7) Blockchain technologies will transform almost everything in financial services&mdash;just not in 2016. </strong>  The Blockchain sector has great start-ups, ex-Wall Street heavyweights, VCs and consortiums betting big on its potential. All of this talent sets-up well for the future, but we don&rsquo;t think 2016 is the tipping point year. We also think that non-financial use cases involving voting, music, art and health records could vie with financial applications to be the first big blockchain success.</p><p> <strong>  8) London will not emerge as the generally accepted fintech capital of the world. </strong>  London appears ascendant when compared one-on-one to any other city. But when you compare London to Silicon Valley and New York, we think that the U.S. will continue to match up very well against any other place in attracting fintech talent and capital.</p><p> <strong>  9) Presidential aspirants won&rsquo;t refrain from using Wall Street as a whipping post. </strong>  Wall Street is not to blame for America&rsquo;s health care, education or immigration challenges. But with politicians of all stripes eager to find a fall guy for America&rsquo;s complex economic challenges, Wall Street is still the perfect patsy. Ongoing negative rhetoric over the airwaves will continue to fuel a perception issue that helps consumer facing fintech.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-23 19:26:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-23 19:26:11.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_R6L0kqE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/nine-things-that-wont-happen-in-fintech-this-year/\", \"post_id\": \"8770\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-23 19:26:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-23 19:26:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"nine-things-that-wont-happen-in-fintech-this-year\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8769\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4165\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nine-Things-That-Won\\u2019t-Happen-in-FinTech-This-Year.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"696\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453718700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4013,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Network Marketing Trumps All Other Marketing Methods","link":"network-marketing-trumps-all-other-marketing-methods","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Regular readers will know that I am a massive fan of using social media and other digital marketing tools and tactics, especially in professional services where we are trying to market our expertise, rather than sell a tangible product.  My reasons are simple:</p><p> We need to create recognition in our target markets mind as the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; person, and</p><p> We need to maintain top-of-mind-awareness with them on an ongoing basis.</p><p> Having said that, nothing is better than word-of-mouth marketing.  Network marketing. Referred lead generation. Centre of influence marketing.</p><h3> Call it whatever you like.</h3><p> <br/> Whatever the particular word-of-mouth tactic, it is that personal endorsement and recommendation from a trusted peer or friend to a prospective client citing YOU as the person they should speak to, which trumps all other forms of marketing in professional services.</p><p> It trumps all other marketing methods because it is the strategy which has the highest conversion rate.  Far more referrals, or personal introductions, result in new clients engaging the professional than any other form of lead or enquiry generation system that you can work by yourself as a total stranger to prospective clients.</p><p> When so much of what professionals do is considered complex and unfathomable, or perhaps just downright dull and unworthy of personal attention, then the prospects confidence in delegating the work to some who is trusted by someone they trust is immense.  Working to create ongoing word-of-mouth support and introductions is critical to any professionals career success, as anyone who has worked in professional services for more than 3 decades would attest.  Those who were doing this work successfully 30 or more years ago virtually onlyworked on word of mouth marketing, or had to survive hand-to-mouth from cold calling.</p><p> In todays world with the communication systems and marketing methods which are so easily introduced, and at such relatively low cost, we have more opportunity than those before us to create large communities of highly engaged potential clients who know what we do, and remember us when &ldquo;that thing&rdquo; needs doing.  Every professional should be taking advantage of that and creating a highly visible personal brand and an engaged community of potential future clients.</p><p> The objective remains the same as it always has: get them talking about the issues, and being aware of what it is we do that can have a positive impact in their life. And then remembering to talk to us when the time is right.</p><h3> My point in reality is simply this: digital marketing supports the creation of more word-of-mouth marketing than any individual could do by simply pressing the flesh in the real world.  </h3><p> <br/> It is not a competing marketing strategy, it is a complementary strategy.</p><p> Get to grips with digital as a means of building and engaging with as large a community as possible of potential clients, as it is the platform for creating more referrals than you could have thought possible. <strong>  In fact, get it right and you could easily end up generating more referrals than you can personally handle. </strong> That would be a good problem to have, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-23 19:52:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-23 19:52:06.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_W1ylN1T.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/network-marketing-trumps-all-other-marketing-methods/\", \"post_id\": \"8772\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-23 19:52:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-23 19:52:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"network-marketing-trumps-all-other-marketing-methods\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8771\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4166\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Network-Marketing-Trumps-All-Other-Marketing-Methods.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"977\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453712400,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4014,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Finding a Financial Advisor With Heart Skills","link":"finding-a-financial-advisor-with-heart-skills","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve written from time to time about the qualities to look for before you engage a financial planner, such as experience, professional qualifications, and having a fiduciary responsibility to clients. One other factor is often important, as well: whether a planner is a &ldquo;heart&rdquo; as well as a &ldquo;head&rdquo; advisor.</p><p> You aren&rsquo;t necessarily going to identify an advisor&rsquo;s &ldquo;heart&rdquo; qualifications with checklists or by asking direct questions. It&rsquo;s often more effective to observe advisors&rsquo; behavior and listen to what they say in initial interviews. Here are a few ways to learn answers to important questions you may not know how to ask:</p><h3> 1. Are you authentic? Do you live what you teach?</h3><p> <br/> Even in pre-engagement interviews, planners may expect you to disclose substantial personal and financial information: your approximate net worth, significant life events like divorces or serious illness, and career or life goals. Notice whether planners seem comfortable sharing appropriately about their own related experiences.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also helpful at this point to ask two direct questions. One: Is your own portfolio invested in the same funds and with the same philosophy as those of your clients? Two: are you a client of another financial planner?</p><h3> 2. Will you  <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/weekly-column/clarify-financial-planning-advice-with-reflective-listening\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   listen  </a> </u>  to me with attention and respect?</h3><p> <br/> Do advisors talk more than they listen? Do they interrupt? Do they brush aside concerns that you raise or fail to answer your questions? For couples, do they fail to interact with both of you? All of these are red flags.</p><p> In addition, you might ask for brief examples of how the advisors help clients navigate difficult situations. Here&rsquo;s the kind of response that would be a positive sign: &ldquo;When the markets drop and a client becomes fearful and wants to go to cash, here is what my response would be. First I would assure them they could absolutely get out of the market if they choose. I would give them time to talk about their fear. Then I would ask questions about how would it feel if they did go to cash, how would they know when to get back into the market, and what would they do with the cash. Essentially, I would support them in talking through their fears rather than simply telling them what they should do.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. Can I trust that you won&rsquo;t judge and criticize me for my financial mistakes?</h3><p> <br/> A useful piece of advice I received years ago was, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell people about your successes and how great you are. Tell them about your warts. Nobody can relate to someone who is perfect.&rdquo;</p><p> It may seem counter-intuitive to trust financial advisors who talk about their own financial screw-ups. Yet someone who can admit to mistakes and learn from them often demonstrates more genuine confidence and maturity than someone who tries to impress you with successes. If advisors seem willing to share their &ldquo;warts,&rdquo; they are unlikely to shame or judge you for asking questions or disclosing your own misjudgments.</p><h3> 4. Does what you do really make a difference for clients?</h3><p> <br/> Ideally, a planner&rsquo;s passion for and commitment to the profession is about people as much as numbers and investment returns. If advisors share client success stories, notice whether they appropriately guard clients&rsquo; privacy, focus on relationships and life transformation, and appear to regard clients with respect and appreciation.</p><p> Essentially, when you interview a prospective financial planner, what you want to know is: <strong>  &ldquo;Can I trust you? Not only with my money, but also with my fears, my life challenges, and my dreams.&rdquo; </strong> Even though you don&rsquo;t put that question into words, you can and should expect planners to answer it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-24 15:13:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-24 15:13:14.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_vcTtCVa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/finding-a-financial-advisor-with-heart-skills/\", \"post_id\": \"8774\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-24 15:13:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-24 15:13:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"finding-a-financial-advisor-with-heart-skills\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8773\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4167\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Finding-a-Financial-Advisor-With-Heart-Skills.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"601\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453752300,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4015,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Purpose Washing, and How to Avoid It","link":"purpose-washing-and-how-to-avoid-it","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  Haley Boehning </u></p><h3> Cause washing, greenwashing, pinkwashing</h3><p> <br/> &hellip; all monikers developed to describe an age-old business tactic: inauthenticity &ndash; and in some cases bold faced deception &ndash; in the name of profitability. I&rsquo;ll add one to the list: purpose-washing.</p><p> We have all seen the flashy marketing campaigns touting a company&rsquo;s purpose, soon revealed to be just expensive hot air when compared to the realities of how the company actually operates (internally and externally).</p><p> How to avoid this? Before you use your purpose for external marketing &ndash; look inward. Follow these three steps.</p><h3> Step #1: Understand the difference between articulating a purpose and living it.</h3><p> <br/> A recent <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/millwardbrownvermeer/insights2020\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Millward Brown Study  </u> </a> revealed that growth companies have one key characteristic in common: purpose. But that&rsquo;s not all. Many under-performing companies also have stated purposes &hellip; so what&rsquo;s the difference? Growth companies in the study not only had a purpose, but made sure their purpose was more than a marketing tag line. A remarkable 80 percent of over-performing companies in the study invested in ensuring that all activities in the company were purpose-led, compared to only 32% of under-performers. Discovering your purpose is just the beginning.</p><h3> Step #2: Align everything in your organization &ndash; not just your external positioning &ndash; with your purpose.</h3><p> <br/> Look at external and internal positioning, people, programs, processes, products, profits, and philanthropy. All programs and all activities should be considered through the filter of your purpose.</p><p> The study&rsquo;s authors state it well: &ldquo;The biggest challenge lies not in defining a purpose, but in living it consistently across the whole organization, ensuring that it remains elevated and a guide to all business activities, not just an element of brand communications or marketing mix. Ultimately, purpose should be the foundation of all strategic choices and decisions and used to create a movement for employees and customers, a movement that has an emotional and societal impact.&rdquo;</p><h3> Step #3: Engage all your stakeholders in your purpose. </h3><p> <br/> As my colleague Barry Chandler wrote in  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.storyforge.co/how-to-avoid-cause-washing-your-brand/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   his reflections on cause washing  </a> </u> , &ldquo;the fish can also rot from the head, so purpose driven brands are driven from the boardroom to the mail room.

{"original_id":4016,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"HR's Role in the Modern Organization","link":"hrs-role-in-the-modern-organization","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Like virtually all other departments, human resources has changed tremendously over the years.</p><p> In fact, while bearing some similarities to their counterparts from history, today&rsquo;s HR departments look almost completely different than their predecessors. So what exactly is HR&rsquo;s role in today&rsquo;s organization? Let&rsquo;s take a look:</p><h3> <strong>  Recruiting </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t just post a job listing and hire the first person who applies.</p><p> HR departments serve as gatekeepers between job seekers and their organizations. They sift through the onslaught of resumes and cover letters &mdash; or at least utilize applicant tracking systems &mdash; to find qualified candidates that appear to meet their company&rsquo;s needs.  </p><p> Once that pool of candidates has been selected for a specific position, HR employees need to proactively manage the talent pipeline. They need to communicate with candidates early and often, providing relevant information and answering any questions that may arise.</p><h3> <strong>  Employee Onboarding </strong></h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s HR departments are also partly responsible for a smooth employee onboarding process with new hires. They need to make sure new employees know who their coworkers are, where their work spaces are, what devices they can use, and the like. They also need to make sure new hires are familiar with company culture and the company handbook.</p><p> Beyond that, HR departments are charged with enrolling new hires in benefits packages (e.g., health insurance, dental insurance, and 401k programs) and adding them to payroll.</p><p> While these tasks have been known to take up a considerable amount of time in the past, thanks to the proliferation of HR software suites, a lot of these responsibilities can be automated.</p><h3> <strong>  Employee Engagement </strong></h3><p> <br/> HR departments can also play a role in ensuring employees are engaged.</p><p> For example, HR professionals who have open-door policies might hear the same complaints from a number of employees &mdash; and relay that information to their manager, suggesting they change the way things are done so workers are happier.</p><p> What&rsquo;s more, HR professionals can also  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/?utm_source=unpaid&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=blogtrial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   help administer weekly pulse surveys  </a> </u> , which are designed to provide a snapshot into the health of an organization at a specific moment in time.</p><p> These surveys provide managers with actionable information in near-real time. So any problems that arise can be addressed immediately.</p><h3> <strong>  Compliance </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are tons of laws that need to be followed. And at each organization, there are company-specific policies that need to be enforced.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s HR departments are charged with the task of ensuring compliance across the board. Professionals need to make sure that their organizations are following the law exactly as it&rsquo;s written. Some of the things HR departments oversee include employee classification (e.g., a full-time employee vs. an independent contractor), compensation discrimination, and EEOC regulations.</p><p> It&rsquo;s critical that HR departments work to ensure their organizations are always in compliance. Otherwise, their companies could be subject to fines, sanctions, or worse.</p><h3> <strong>  Employer Branding </strong></h3><p> <br/> According to the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Small Business Administration  </a> </u> , there were roughly 28 million businesses in the United States in 2010. With so many organizations out there, it can be difficult to make your stand out amongst the rest.</p><p> Your business needs to attract and hire top talent if it wishes to succeed.  One way to do that is through employer branding &mdash; another responsibility that falls under the purview of HR.</p><p> Quite simply, employer branding is the sum of the HR team&rsquo;s efforts at promoting their organization to a specific set of individuals. For example, if a business is looking to hire rock-star graphic designers, it might begin poking around on sites like  <u>  <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dribbble  </a> </u>  and make a presence there.</p><p> You know how everyone thinks Google would be an awesome company to work for? The company obviously builds great products &mdash; but a lot of that sentiment is tied to masterfully successful employer branding.</p><h3> <strong>  Organizational Change Management </strong></h3><p> <br/> Successful organizations understand that, in order to succeed, they have to be able to pivot on a dime if the business climate calls for it.</p><p> As an example, consider the case of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-case-studies-successful-change-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nokia  </a> </u> : A leader in the mobile phone space in the 1990s and early 2000s, Nokia missed its chance to continue its dominance when Apple beat them to market with a smartphone. Understanding that they had essentially lost the mobile wars, Nokia sold its phone business and shifted its focus to networking and mapping.</p><p> In this vein, HR departments play a huge role when it comes to change management. When employees are expected to do one thing one day and then something entirely different the next, not all of them will take the news well. In these situations, it is imperative that the HR team works its magic to help assuage concerns and improve morale.</p><h3> <strong>  Compensation and Benefits </strong></h3><p> <br/> Woohoo! It&rsquo;s payday! Every employee loves to be handed a check. And each one also enjoys having health insurance and dental insurance. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to be able to contribute to a company-matching 401k account either.</p><p> Everything related to compensation and benefits is housed within the HR department.</p><h3> <strong>  Development </strong></h3><p> <br/> No matter the position, virtually all new hires will have to learn at least some skills on the job. For example, even the most seasoned journalist who doesn&rsquo;t need any help when it comes to writing a story might need to be trained on how to use their new company&rsquo;s content management system.</p><p> On top of that, even if someone&rsquo;s been at the company for a decade, new technologies come along and all of a sudden, that individual has no idea what they&rsquo;re doing anymore.</p><p> HR departments are also responsible for ensuring that employees have the tools and knowledge they need to succeed at their jobs. Beyond that, HR workers can keep their eyes open for other professional development opportunities that may present themselves &mdash; and share them with the team.</p><h3> <strong>  Exit Interviews </strong></h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s HR departments oversee candidates from the first day they walk through the door until the day they leave. Part of that supervision includes conducting exit interviews in which HR employees pick the brains of departing workers.</p><p> By conducting exit interviews, organizations learn why an individual decided to leave the company, what aspects of work that person liked the most, and which areas of work could be improved. That information is then analyzed, and any necessary changes are made.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-24 16:18:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-24 16:18:45.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_hQrv226.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/hrs-role-in-the-modern-organization/\", \"post_id\": \"8778\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-24 16:18:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-24 16:18:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"hrs-role-in-the-modern-organization\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8777\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4169\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HRs-Role-in-the-Modern-Organization.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"649\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453734000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4017,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Blogging Tips to Connect Better With Readers","link":"8-blogging-tips-to-connect-better-with-readers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_blogging\" target=\"_blank\">   Blogging  </a> </u>  came on the scene in 1994 but at that time it was more of a personal journal or &ldquo;log&rdquo; of activities. In 1997 the term was &ldquo;weblog&rdquo; for web log or diary. Today blogging is evolving once again. Some are writing their long-form content on  <a href=\"https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47445/~/long-form-posts-on-linkedin---overview\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   LinkedIn as a post  </u>    </a> and now on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/488014787881885/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook&rsquo;s revamped NOTES  </a> </u> , but whether we call it a blog, a post, or a note, the purpose in our writing is to connect with our readers and share information that is either helpful or interesting.</p><p> It&rsquo;s usually a little more casual in tone. It&rsquo;s not a novel (which I always have to remind myself) but it should be worth your reader&rsquo;s time. Here are my 8 tips to connect with your readers in your blogging:</p><h3> 1. Write with a conversational tone when blogging.</h3><p> <br/> Your reader should feel as if they are sitting at a fireside chat with you, hearing you share your nuggets of wisdom. Speak directly to a person as you write as often as possible. &ldquo;I often hear &hellip;&rdquo; Unless, of course, you are writing a company blog that requires you speak in third person, posts that are directly from YOU, sound more warm and conversational when you use &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;you.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Don&rsquo;t speak so formally when blogging.</h3><p> <br/> Using contractions will make your writing feel a bit more casual. Let that voice of your 4th grade English teacher go. It&rsquo;s okay to squish your words together. Instead of &ldquo;Do not speak so formal that people can not relax into your writing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so formal.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re not writing a textbook, you&rsquo;re writing a blog post. Loosen your tie, put on a flannel and relax a bit.</p><h3> 3. Respect your reader&rsquo;s intelligence but don&rsquo;t go all corporate jargon on them.</h3><p> <br/> When you write a piece with tips or advice that is so basic or elementary people leave hungry for a meatier piece, you have wasted your reader&rsquo;s time. If you use so much technical jargon, that they need to Google every other phrase, they go away frustrated. This starts with knowing your audience. Are they beginning their career right out of college and need very basic and obvious information about interviewing? Then write as a friend would write to them. If they are a highly technical audience, use terminology they know, but perhaps explain it once for those who might be visiting or just beginning their journey. You may have been doing something for 25 years, but don&rsquo;t forget those who are still learning.</p><h3> 4. To Piggy-back on the last point, write with words real people use&hellip;in this century.</h3><p> <br/> There must be some writers who get paid by the number of words people have to look up in the dictionary or ask SIRI for the meaning. Instead of writing, &ldquo;Basic skills are needed&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;Rudimentary proficiencies are necessary&hellip;&rdquo; SERIOUSLY? Was their writing coach Shakespeare? Use simple language that you would use in casual conversations. A blog post should be a conversation, not a legal document&hellip;unless you&rsquo;re writing about the legal industry&hellip;then go ahead and write like Shakespeare, those reading it are probably used to that. You can run your writing through tools that measure readability, like  <a href=\"http://readability-score.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  readability-score.com </a>  or check your entire website with sites like  <a href=\"http://read-able.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Read-Able.com    </a></p><h3> 5. Make others the hero in your stories.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re always writing about your awesomeness, how great your company is, or how amazing your life is, people tune out. We want to hang out with people who make us feel better, not worse. We connect with people who are more like us. Sure it&rsquo;s great to hear how you overcame adversity or how you did something that was incredible but bring it back to ME. How can I apply what you learned, to my life? Give us 3 tips you learned that we can apply. 5 lessons that will help all of us do something better.</p><h3> 6. Don&rsquo;t use ridiculously obvious questions in your writing.</h3><p> <br/> I was reading a post yesterday that started with, &ldquo;What is it that we breathe in every day? We want it fresh, but we&rsquo;ll breathe it in dirty if we have to&hellip;&rdquo; I kept thinking it was a riddle and was waiting for an answer that wasn&rsquo;t so obvious. The answer, of course, was AIR. It was a waste of words. Don&rsquo;t write long obvious questions that are just meant to add more words to a post without a real purpose. Unless your readers are kindergartners, ask questions that we really want to know the answers to.</p><h3> 7. Be relevant to your audience.</h3><p> <br/> Unless you are writing for retired executives over the age of 85, using words like stewardess or secretary immediately makes me wonder if the person writing was part of a cryogenic experiment and was frozen for the past 50 years. Referencing Captain Kangaroo or Gunsmoke will send your readers to  <u>  <a href=\"http://imdb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IMDB.com  </a> </u>  to find out what you are talking about. (By the way,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047718/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Captain Kangaroo  </a> </u>  was the longest running kids morning show in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s until Sesame Street dethroned it, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gunsmoke  </a> </u>  was an old western TV drama in the late 50&rsquo;s through the 70&rsquo;s&hellip;but I had to look these up&hellip;I&rsquo;m not THAT old!). Bottom line is use language, examples, television show references, and anything else that your readers would be experiencing. If you aren&rsquo;t sure what they are watching or reading, you probably need to do some blog reading yourself. Take a walk over to  <u>  <a href=\"http://huffingtonpost.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Huffington Post  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Business Insider  </a> </u>  for what&rsquo;s hot. These are two of the most popular blogs.</p><h3> 8. Where&rsquo;d you find that?</h3><p> <br/> If you are using statistics or a fact that leaves your readers asking, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you find that?&rdquo; you should do the work for them and add a hyperlink to the text. If you are writing about a topic in your industry niche and link out to more resources in your industry (even if you are just deep-linking to another post on your website where people can find more information) Google gives you kudos for this. It is providing more relevant information and expanding on the topic. (Linking out to Captain Kangaroo and Gunsmoke, however, probably do nothing to give you search engine brownie points.)</p><p> What are your tips for better blog connections? Are there specific things that make you feel disconnected with a blogger or more connected? I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.

The same is true for your health. In this interview, Heidi Hanna, PhD., an EO speaker and the CEO and founder of SYNERGY, shares her insights into the significance of stress and how it can be harnessed to recharge your business owner battery.</p><h3> What is the biggest contributor to stress, and how can entrepreneurs avoid it?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  HH/ </strong>  &ldquo;Stress in itself isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, so we don&rsquo;t necessarily want to avoid it. A completely stress-free life would actually lead to atrophy and breakdown because we would lose the stimulation for growth. The problem with stress lies in our interpretation of it, how we perceive it and our inability to balance it with adequate recovery. The primary reason why stress affects people in negative ways is because they don&rsquo;t have the energy necessary to keep up with demands. It&rsquo;s the energy deficit, not the specific stressor, which causes problems across multiple dimensions&mdash; body, mind and spirit. Therefore, the key to a successful relationship with stress is maintaining adequate energy throughout the day by oscillating periods of spending energy with strategic energy investments.&rdquo;</p><h3> How can entrepreneurs better manage the stress of maintaining a work/life balance?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  HH/ </strong>  &ldquo;Work/life balance shouldn&rsquo;t be measured by the amount of time we spend on each, as most entrepreneurs know there are seasons where different aspects of our lives demand more focused attention. The reality is that balance comes by creating harmony between the different elements of life as they all interact with one another, and training ourselves to be more fully focused on each moment we are in, rather than constantly multitasking or worrying about things that we could or should be doing elsewhere. This mental gymnastics wears us out and leaves us depleted at the end of the day, so we&rsquo;re unable to give our best energy to those we love at home.</p><p> &ldquo;By managing our energy more effectively throughout the day, taking breaks consistently and training our brains to be more engaged in the present moment, we can have more energy to spend in the time we do have with friends and family. If we obsess about how much time we have or don&rsquo;t have, we can easily find ourselves just going through the motions&mdash; physically present but mentally or emotionally out of it. The key is training ourselves to show up fully in the moments that matter most.&rdquo;</p><h3> How can entrepreneurs recharge without feeling like they&rsquo;re failing their business?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  HH/ </strong>  &ldquo;Studies show that even short recharge breaks can help individuals manage energy more effectively, leading to greater levels of productivity and engagement. Learning to relax is not only good for keeping entrepreneurs charged for action, but it also significantly improves their ability to be creative and access intuition, two skills that have been shown to be critical to entrepreneurial success. Unfortunately, when we&rsquo;re stuck in stress mode, the brain experiences cortical inhibition, which locks us into doing things the way we&rsquo;ve always done them before because it feels safe. This can also mentally prevent us from trying recharging techniques because the fear of losing precious time triggers this type of brain freeze.</p><p> &ldquo;The best advice I can give to an entrepreneur is to try recharging rituals for a week and monitor their progress in areas such as energy levels, productivity and engagement. Once you see the personal benefits that you can receive in such a short time investment, it will be hard to justify not making recharge breaks part of your regular routine. People say they feel guilty taking down time when they should be working, but if you really recognize the value of down time in boosting your productivity, creativity and adaptable effectiveness, you should feel guilty not making it a mandatory part of your day!&rdquo;</p><h3> What are the long-term effects of stress?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  HH/ </strong>  &ldquo;Unmanaged chronic stress has been linked to all major diseases and disorders, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke and dementia. Stress does not cause disease to happen, but it speeds up the development of anything that might be wrong in the body or brain. When stress is acute, it actually causes short-term health improvements as a way to help protect the body. But when it&rsquo;s chronic or long-term in nature, or even just perceived as being a long-term threat (such as never having enough time, never having enough energy, never having enough resources, etc.), it causes the worst type of internal wear and tear, increasing inflammation, strain on the heart and arteries, and eventually even depleting brain chemicals needed for optimal thinking and feeling. When stress continues to be a problem, we can feel exhausted, overwhelmed and burnt out not just from a helpless perspective, but also because our brain chemistry is so depleted that the lens through which we see the world is literally dark and gloomy.&rdquo;</p><h3> How does stress affect the day-to-day operations of a business?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  HH/  </strong> &ldquo;When stress is chronic or feels out of control, it quickly depletes human capital by keeping employees stuck in &lsquo;fight or flight&rsquo; mode, hindering their ability to think clearly and pushing them toward multitasking as the norm. Studies have shown that multitasking not only &lsquo;dumbs&rsquo; us down, but it also wastes time as it can take up to 20 minutes to get back into a focused mindset after a distraction. Stress can also shift individual and group perceptions to one that is more fear-based, leading to over-reacting to challenges, an increase in frequency and intensity of errors, ineffective communication and a lack of trust in leadership. All of these negative interpersonal dynamics ultimately waste our most precious time and energy resources.</p><p> &ldquo;What most people don&rsquo;t realize is that stress doesn&rsquo;t need to be eliminated, but can actually become a stimulant for growth instead of breakdown; it just needs to be managed more effectively. Excess stress should be minimized through simple shifts like noise reduction, lighting adjustments and giving employees more encouragement to get access to fresh air. Systemic changes in the business operations can create an even more significant impact, such as scheduling in 50-minute increments instead of one hour (or 25 minutes instead of a half hour) to allow time for transition between appointments; creating a culture of energy management by providing healthy snacks and movement breaks; and incorporating strategic down time as company policy. Employees should be rewarded for investing in their own personal energy as a resource they can share with the company, and leaders must lead by example by managing their own energy first and showing up fully in the moments that matter most.&rdquo;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-24 20:15:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-24 20:15:09.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_szwco8F.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-pros-and-cons-of-stress/\", \"post_id\": \"8781\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-24 20:15:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-24 20:15:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-pros-and-cons-of-stress\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8782\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4171\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Stress.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1644\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453730400,"author_id":193,"chart_url":""}

To say the jury is still out on whether the change in water was responsible for the spike in Legionnaire's cases is kind of like saying the jury is still out on whether greenhouse gases cause climate change. Let's don't be silly. Of course it was the water. What did you think it was?</p><p> Flint River water is notoriously polluted, due to the river's use as an industrial dumping ground for much of the twentieth century. The river is known to have high levels of (for example) heavy metals. We also know that various species of amoeba tend to show up in high concentrations in such places:</p><p> Acanthamoebae, which are free-living amoebae, occur worldwide in soil and water. It has been isolated from ponds, lakes, brackish water,and seawater; filters of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning units; medical equipment, such as gastric wash tubing, dental irrigation units, contact lenses, and contact lens solutions . . . It has also been isolated from toxic waste dumpsites with high levels of pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, and polychlorinated biphenyls.

That's also how Legionella bacteria know how to live inside human macrophages. They've honed their intracellular survival tricks (for millions of years) in amoebae, which resemble macrophages in many important ways.</p><p> Acanthamoebae have the ability, in times of stress, to form durable cysts, and we now know that inhalation of Legionella-infected amoebal cysts is the primary means of transmission of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease. So if you create conditions that are right for a buildup of Acanthamoebae (and their cysts), you almost certainly have conditions that are right for spreading Legionnaires' disease.</p><p> Flint has exactly the kind of nasty, toxic-waste-laden water that invites microorganisms to cooperate in complex webs of interdependency in order to survive. It's the perfect breeding ground for Acanthamoebae and thus Legionella.</p><p> Sure, we need to wait for CDC to weigh in before declaring, definitively, that the polluted Flint River is to blame for the uptick in Legionnaires' cases. But anyone with any microbiological training knows what's going on here.

Simple doesn&rsquo;t always mean easy.</h3><p> <br/> And, sometimes simple is actually hard to pull off. But some companies have mastered the art of simplicity. And, in doing so, they created customer experiences that are easier, frictionless, and more desirable.</p><p> Siegle+Gale recently released their  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicityindex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Global Brand Simplicity Index  </a> </u> , and, for the third straight year, Aldi, the grocery store chain, ranked first &ndash; or should I say simplest. The grocer won this honor because of a number of things, but most notably for their &ldquo;uncomplicated offers.&rdquo;</p><p> So, I started thinking about the experiences that I&rsquo;ve had that are simple. I remember going to a The Homestead, a restaurant in upstate New York. There weren&rsquo;t menus. They didn&rsquo;t need them. I&rsquo;ll never forget what the server said when it was time for us to order. She said, &ldquo;We have three things that we serve at The Homestead. We have steak. We have lobster.

Of course you can add a slice of cheese to the burger, but what you won&rsquo;t find is a chicken sandwich or any other option that takes away from the beautifully simple concept of In-N-Out Burger.</p><p> Chic-fil-A is another example. They expanded from chicken sandwiches to chicken wraps and salads with chicken. What you won&rsquo;t find is a hamburger.</p><p> Ted Drewes is a frozen custard stand that sells&hellip; frozen custard. Nothing else. You can&rsquo;t get regular ice cream. You can&rsquo;t get gelato. You can only get desserts with frozen custard.

I can&rsquo;t speak to the success of the product, but MetLife did create a super-simple way to buy life insurance. You go to Walmart, take the box, which clearly states the details of a very simple life insurance policy, to the cashier, pay for it, and go home and register.

And when you care so much about production and sales, you are likely to have very high standards when it comes to excellence. While there's nothing wrong with aiming high, you shouldn't forget about your employees' condition during periods of growth.</p><p> Listed below are some warning signs of a negative atmosphere in the workplace, which can also indicate that you may have been overworking your employees.</p><h3> 1. Highly Emotional Employees</h3><p> <br/> Emotion and work are not supposed to mix, but you have to remember that your employees are human beings that are capable of showing their emotions. If you see someone so upset or in tears because of the pressures of the job, you will need to do something about it. Find out what's going on and listen to what they have to say about whatever it is that's bothering them.</p><h3> 2. Lack of Trust Among Team Members</h3><p> <br/> For a team to be successful, there must be a high degree of trust among your team members. There should be open communication between them, and they need to respect one another as well. A good team isn't likely to take for granted one another's feeling and thoughts. So, if your team starts blaming each other or not trusting each other, it's likely that the pressures from work are affecting their relationship.</p><h3> 3. Employee Tardiness</h3><p> <br/> There's no doubt that employee tardiness can ruin workflow, cause problems with clients, and eventually create conflicts among employees. If anyone in your team is constantly coming to work late, you have to call his or her attention. Ask what the reason is for the tardiness, and decide on a start time that's acceptable for both parties.</p><h3> 4. Work/Life Imbalance</h3><p> <br/> If it seems that your employees are married to their work and they don't seem to have time for their personal lives, it may be a sign that they're overloaded with work. You have the power to make things more manageable for them by offering flex hours or telecommuting or perhaps a compressed workweek.</p><h3> 5. High Employee Turnover</h3><p> <br/> If you've been losing employees continuously and you feel like you've been interviewing job candidates for a long time already, it just means that your employees are unhappy with their work in your company. If you want to combat the high turnover rate in your company, you should try doing the following:</p><li> Allow employees to enjoy outings or trips every once in awhile.</li><li> Grant more days or weeks off to increase vacation time for your employees.</li><li> Implement a 'casual' dress day in the workplace at least once a week.</li><li> Review and enhance your employee compensation packages every year.</li><li> Offer free lunch for workers at least once a week. <br/>  </li><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/mentor-program-details/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Holding a leadership position is no easy task  </a> </u> . You have to do everything to ensure the success of your company, but it should not be at the expense of your workers' well-being.

This meant that not only were they running and growing their own advisory practice, but they were also measured on their ability to help all other advisors in their office grow their business as well.</p><h3> They also managed the entire office and personnel. Jealous yet? </h3><p> <br/> From the outside looking in, peers and colleagues looked at them as wildly successful professionals, perched on a pedestal, juggling the world of advising and managing&hellip; creating the fairytale picture of living the &ldquo;best of both worlds.&rdquo; Who wouldn&rsquo;t want the opportunity to manage, yet still be given carte blanche to run their own advisory practice? After all, you get to spend your day doing what you love, and help others do the same, and as office production numbers go up, so does your paycheck.</p><p> This is the exact mindset that one producing manager had when I met him. He told me about how flattered he was to be asked to take on this role, how he had never really considered it before, but he stepped into it knowing just how privileged he was for being given the opportunity. He acknowledged there was a learning curve coaching other advisors, but considering how much support he had in his office, he was confident that he would grow into it. That is, until one day, he had to clean the office toilets.</p><p> That&rsquo;s right&mdash;this isn&rsquo;t a misprint&mdash;clean the toilets in the bathrooms of the office he now managed. The one where nobody else was ever appointed for coordinating janitorial services. Where his assistant (who was selected for him) worked her own determined schedule, and where no other management sat on a full time, day-to-day basis. Just another &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; producing manager&hellip;and his toilet.</p><h3> After hearing his story, this is what I shared with him: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. It&rsquo;s not just about you anymore. </strong> Managing cannot be done with tunnel vision.</p><p> <strong>  2. With great power comes great responsibility. </strong> The office you manage comes with people who need your time, direction, insight and support.</p><p> <strong>  3. If everyone is doing the same thing, nothing will ever get done. </strong> Managing any team or office requires knowing what you need in order to thrive, and then finding people who bring something unique to the table to make it happen.</p><p> <strong>  4. Forget about your own worth. </strong> As a manager you now have to put a price tag on the time and talent of your team.

{"original_id":4023,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Do You Network?","link":"how-do-you-network","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Are those LI invitations to connect from people who are offering their services, the best way to network online? My reaction to them is an automatic &ldquo;no thank you&rdquo;.</p><p> I find that the introduction is followed by a sales pitch including an offer to continue the conversation or receive some freebie. But what is missing is the lack of regard to who I am or what I might need. Although they each describe the sender&rsquo;s business, they are obviously canned and I toss them quickly.</p><h3> When they first began to come into my mailbox I actually agreed to speak to a couple of LI members who&rsquo;s product intrigued me.</h3><p> <br/> We spent a &frac12; hour on the phone and this time they did listen somewhat. I even made a referral in one case and know from the person I referred that he became a client. The LI member never let me know or thought to say thank you.</p><p> Big mistake. When I find out that this &ldquo;networking&rdquo; is viewed as a one way street, I drop out of the game. The last one I spoke to, when we ended by his asking me for referrals and I suggested he might remember me as well, his suggestion was that I could fill out the profile in the group we share membership.</p><p> If all of this sounds like complaints, that is not my purpose here. I am simply appealing to everyone to learn about proper networking to make it worthwhile for you and for everyone.</p><p> Many people have the idea that the purpose to networking is selling.</p><h3> The quickest way to lose my attention, is when you start by telling me what your services are.</h3><p> <br/> In person it&rsquo;s the equivalent of shoving your business card in my hand with the desperate look of send me referrals. Seriously? Why would I. I don&rsquo;t know you, but more importantly you have demonstrated no interest in knowing me.</p><p> The purpose of building a good network is much more than a basis for getting new clients. A network of connections, which has been built over time, is a source for many things, such as career management in general, a resource for information and even valuable friendships. It is not an overnight way to get new clients.</p><h3> The main feature of a good network is that it is mutually beneficial.</h3><p> <br/> Despite the way it is commonly done networking is not an elevator speech nor an exchange of business cards in the hope they&rsquo;ll become or refer a client.</p><p> Networking is a sincere interest to learn and understand the needs of someone else with the purpose of your being able to help them now or in the future with a referral, some information or other helpful gesture. Obviously you hope for reciprocity.</p><p> Effective networking assumes that you have good communication skills that enable you to listen well to what other&rsquo;s need and to articulate clearly what you do and how you can be of service. However, a conversation which includes talk about hobbies can be much more engaging than one limited to business and more memorable.</p><p> When you get the hang of networking, you will note that it takes place everywhere, not solely on LI or in professional and business groups. How surprised I was to find that the owner of the gift store where I was making a purchase was a formerly practicing lawyer. She gave me two referrals on the spot when our conversation led us to talk aboutl our career paths.</p><p> The maintenance and nurturing of networking contacts is as vital as making it in the first place. Renewing them through follow-up emails, holiday greetings, sending interesting articles, periodical check ins, coffee, invitations to play golf, referrals, etc. are all important parts of the picture.</p><p> Trade in your negative ideas that networking is a hard sell of you and your services in exchange for the idea that it is the practice of showing genuine interest and generosity to those you meet. Hopefully you will find the process enjoyable and enriching.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 14:09:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 14:09:30.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_x9todko.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-do-you-network/\", \"post_id\": \"8792\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 14:09:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 14:09:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-do-you-network\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8790\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4177\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cleaning-Toilets-What-They-Don\\u2019t-Tell-You-About-Running-an-Office.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"846\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453834800,"author_id":151,"chart_url":""}

The expectation of immediate personal gratification on the part of the advisor is not part of the equation, yet often has a snowballing effect that people respond to by providing referrals, which often results in more business.</p><p> In a recent conversation with a very successful wirehouse advisor who manages over a $1BN in client assets, he seemed somewhat surprised that in 2015 when the markets were flat, his team had a year of amazing growth: over 25%. I know that this group of advisors is bright, talented and capable, yet their success is likely about much more than that. They are well-known for doing the right thing for clients, always keeping their best interests in mind without an expectation of the outcome. It is a way of life for this team &ndash; one might say embedded in their culture &ndash; to ensure they follow the &ldquo;Golden Rule&rdquo; and they have been rewarded in both peace of mind and a solid bottom line.</p><p> Applying a similar philosophy to organizations and their responsibility to their advisors, the results are similarly positive. When advisors refer to the &ldquo;great culture&rdquo; at their firm, it speaks to a concept that is subjective yet palpable. A firm that fosters a great culture with the organizational philosophy of authenticity will have long-term benefits: a trickledown effect on retention and loyalty. For example, advisors at Raymond James have a very different sense of loyalty to the firm (reported at less than 1% attrition per year) when compared to advisors at wirehouses that may &ldquo;no longer look or function like the firm&rdquo; that they originally thought they joined.</p><p> Considering the vast changes to the advisory business as a whole &ndash; such as increasing regulatory requirements, evolving business models, and advances in technology &ndash; there&rsquo;s no doubt that wirehouse culture has morphed into something their employees no longer recognize. With thousands of employees to manage and the ever-watchful eye on profitability, many wirehouses have indeed become more bureaucratic and less personal. Today there are firms that counter the typical wirehouse model by having their advisors own their own book of business (even as employees), providing retention bonuses for their loyalty and treating advisors as if they are &ldquo;the clients&rdquo; deserving of responsiveness and service.</p><h3> This kind of attention to the individual from the corporate level sends the message that each individual matters&mdash;and that&rsquo;s where the positive trickledown begins.</h3><p> <br/> Not that culture can be regulated or dictated, but FINRA is working in 2016 towards a more objective set of criteria to evaluate the culture of a firm, reviewing incentives and conflicts of interest in the retail brokerage sector. They have been collecting information on how firms navigate conflicts of interest in areas like proprietary products and the compensation structure for registered reps to be sure that the clients&rsquo; interests are being served in the process. And the Labor Department is poised to release a final rule in the spring that, though controversial, is intended to ensure that financial advisers act in the best interests of their clients when dealing with retirement accounts.</p><h3> At the end of the day, successful advisors and businesses will thrive when their core principles are rooted in integrity and fiduciary responsibility.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Doing the right thing </strong> &ndash; without the thought of the immediate benefit to the individual or organization &ndash; <strong>  fosters loyalty which, in turn, has long-term positive rewards. </strong> And, in the short run, it certainly allows each of us to feel better about the work that we do and sleep better at night.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 14:12:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 14:12:30.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_dKjNq6k.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-building-a-relationship-based-on-trust-will-reward-you-with-the-key-to-success-loyalty/\", \"post_id\": \"8794\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 14:12:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 14:12:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-building-a-relationship-based-on-trust-will-reward-you-with-the-key-to-success-loyalty\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8793\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4178\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Building-a-Relationship-Based-on-Trust-Will-Reward-You-with-the-Key-to-Success-Loyalty.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1108\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453830300,"author_id":96,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4025,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Truth About Debt","link":"the-truth-about-debt","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There&rsquo;s a scene in &ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&rdquo; where Glinda asks Dorothy: &ldquo;Are you a good witch or a bad witch?&rdquo; And Dorothy responds, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a witch at all.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to debt, you may well ask &ldquo;is this good debt or bad debt&rdquo; as a way to understand (or rationalize) your current financial condition.</p><p> <strong>  Good Debt&mdash;the kind where you get to take a tax deduction&mdash;is your home mortgage or a business loan to buy equipment or finance operations. </strong> But here&rsquo;s a news flash: a tax deduction is never a reason to take on more debt than you need or can handle comfortably.  </p><p> Another rationale for carrying a really big mortgage is the &ldquo;future value of a dollar&rdquo; argument. Basically, the dollar you spend thirty years from now is worth very little relative to the cost of a dollar today. And yes, that&rsquo;s true. Think about the cost of a pack of gum thirty years ago vs. the cost today. The gum isn&rsquo;t inherently more expensive, it&rsquo;s just the value of a dollar has decreased. Make sense?</p><p> But what if all that &ldquo;good debt&rdquo; restricts your ability to achieve other goals in your life? Is it still a good idea?</p><p> <strong>  Bad Debt&mdash;think Revolving Credit, aka credit cards&mdash;carries with it no tax deduction and typically high interest rates. </strong> You know the kind where you can make a &ldquo;minimum payment&rdquo; of $150 on a $15,000 balance and be at peace with the credit card companies. Unless you can pay off the balance each month, it is typically a screaming bad deal. Just because your card has a credit limit of $25,000 doesn&rsquo;t mean you should use it. It might be a really good place to go in case of emergency, but for vacations, entertainment or other discretionary spending, carrying a balance on your credit card is a sure path to misery.</p><h3> In reality, debt is neither good nor bad.</h3><p> <br/> It is a liability with an extra kicker attached that lessens your net worth and diminishes your free cash flow. That extra kicker of course is the interest charged&mdash;and regardless of the amount, it is the cost of doing business (unavoidable). Those with high debt are most likely living in a more perilous position than those with low or no debt. Unless you have a very high net worth (and if you did, why would you be carrying debt?), the loss of a job, a big unexpected expense, death or disability coupled with debt could be financially catastrophic.</p><p> Credit card debt can be a tool, a temporary bridge, to satisfy a specific situation. Think medical emergency, damage to property or something unexpected that just can&rsquo;t wait. However, a tool can just as easily become a weapon when misused. After all, what&rsquo;s easier than whipping out the plastic and focusing on the purchase rather than the bill that will show up in the next TWENTY FIVE days.</p><p> Carol is 28, an independent sales rep and a loving and caring aunt to her four nieces and nephews. When it came time for holiday shopping, Carol bought lavishly expensive presents for them, nearly maxing out her credit card in the process. The holidays were spent with great celebration and happiness. Except Carol didn&rsquo;t expect the car wreck on the way home from a party, nor did she account for the broken leg and the deductible on both her medical and car insurance. Nor did she consider that her income source would dry up if she were unable to go out and see her customers.</p><h3> The result was financial ruin.</h3><p> <br/> She managed to borrow money from relatives to stay afloat until she was back on her feet, but was left with tens of thousands in debt and nothing to fall back on. All those gifts for her family left her without a financial cushion and&mdash;after the accident&mdash;in a perilous position.</p><p> Debt isn&rsquo;t good or bad, but it can lead to constraints and restrict your ability to react to unexpected situations. The higher the amount of debt you carry, the greater the risk to handle life&rsquo;s emergencies (or opportunities). Debt encumbers you from saving, investing, expanding, exploring and ultimately living your values.</p><p> Just avoid the debt trap&mdash;it is certainly no Yellow Brick Road.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 14:15:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 14:15:06.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_tOPWOEl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-truth-about-debt/\", \"post_id\": \"8796\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 14:15:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 14:15:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-truth-about-debt\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8795\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4179\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Truth-About-Debt.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"694\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453832100,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4026,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Negotiate Your Way to Sales Success","link":"negotiate-your-way-to-sales-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The topic of negotiation scares most people. But by viewing a negotiation as a friendly conversation seeking to find a happy ending for all parties, it becomes doable. Successful salespeople actually begin the negotiation phase at the first stage of contact.  Using a similar communication style for job interviews will work to your benefit.</p><p> Friendly negotiation with the intent to find the best solution for all parties usually results in acquiring the sale along with a loyal clientele.</p><h3> Initial Contact</h3><p> <br/> It is a rarity upon asking someone for an appointment, whether it be a cold call or a referral, that the person will be up for a discussion the moment you ask. People are busy. The general replies are either&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the time&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested&rdquo;.</p><p> Your best option is to agree that time is short or that interest is limited. Agreement, in this instance, usually becomes an interesting experience. People are so surprised that you agree, they let their guard down to take another 30 seconds to listen to what you have to say next.</p><p> The best response is to suggest that &ldquo;down the road&rdquo; (best in your vocabulary) will be a better time to meet. A nod of agreement can almost be heard. Ask when the preferred time would be for you to check back in. When you do, most often an appointment will be granted.</p><h3> Higher View</h3><p> <br/> Relax and enjoy the conversation. Get the long term view of what the person is trying to accomplish and how they expect to achieve it. It may be so complex, you realize you can&rsquo;t help as initially thought. But that&rsquo;s okay. Determine if there is a secondary route you might take as a backup vendor. If there is, suggest it. Again most people are surprised by the &ldquo;backup&rdquo; offer and will ask for more insight on the matter.</p><p> The reason this is the case is due to the honesty involved. Your personal brand demonstrates integrity and that&rsquo;s what clients usually care about most.</p><h3> The Relaxed Team Approach</h3><p> <br/> Even if you have a sales manager on your back urging you to make the sale, do not rush the process. Take your time. Ask to meet the team or those reporting to the person with whom you are holding the meeting. Get everyone&rsquo;s input on what they believe will be a winning outcome.</p><p> The team approach seen as working to the benefit of everyone involved, will result in getting the team to cheer you on. The relationships are built on a strong foundation.  This builds tremendous value in the overall service you provide. And the value built eliminates the need to discount the pricing.</p><h3> Asking for the Sale</h3><p> <br/> Most sales are not given as an award. It&rsquo;s up to the salesperson to ask for it.
